TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

Seven months in, and I find myself in the peculiar position of an editor
who has begun to dream about his own magazine. Literally. Last Tuesday I
woke at three in the morning with the absolute conviction that I had
forgotten to include page numbers. (Margaret assures me I had not.)

But dreaming, in a sense, is what this issue is about.

When the stories for our July number began arriving -- by post, by
courier, by one memorable hand-delivery from a breathless author who had
run six blocks from the subway -- I noticed something remarkable. Without
any coordination, without any editorial directive, five of our six
contributors had independently written stories about memory and identity.
About the question that science fiction, at its best, is uniquely equipped
to explore: What makes you YOU?

Dr. Koslov gives us consciousness reduced to mathematics -- and the
terrifying moment when the equation doesn't balance. Rex Drummond, in his
inimitable style, asks whether a man with a gun can choose who he is when
the bullets stop flying. Theodore Cain imagines a future where your
memories are literally for sale, and young Danny Kowalski -- just nineteen
years old, mark him well -- wonders what identity means when twelve people
share your face. Even Father Aquino, in what I believe is the finest story
we have yet published, finds the question echoed across light-years: is
identity unique, or universal?

Only Lucian Marsh stands apart, offering instead a story about what happens
when identity dissolves entirely. Trust Marsh to find the darkness in any
theme.

I said in my first editorial that science fiction is the literature of the
question "What if?" I now believe it is equally the literature of the
question "Who am I?" The rocket ships and ray guns are magnificent set
dressing, but the human being inside the space suit -- that is where our
genre lives or dies.

This is the issue where I believe we have found our voice. Not my voice --
the magazine's voice. TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND is, and shall
remain, a magazine about people. People in extraordinary circumstances,
yes. People confronting the unknown, certainly. But people first, and
always.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                         ALENA'S DIVERGENCE
                          by Dr. Vincent Koslov
============================================================================

I.

The human brain contains approximately ten billion neurons. Each neuron
forms, on average, seven thousand synaptic connections. The total number of
possible neural states exceeds the number of atoms in the observable
universe by a factor so large that to write it in standard notation would
require more paper than exists on Earth.

Dr. Alena Voss knew these numbers the way most people know their telephone
exchange. They were the constants of her profession, the fixed stars by
which she navigated. She had spent eleven years -- first at the Kaiser
Wilhelm Institute in Goettingen, then at the Czerny Laboratory in Prague,
and finally here, at the Rensselaer Neurophysics Center in upstate New
York -- attempting to reduce those numbers to something tractable. Something
that could be written on a blackboard, argued over at conferences, tested
and falsified and refined.

She called it the Voss Transform: a mathematical operation that collapsed
the staggering complexity of neural architecture into a system of coupled
differential equations. Seventeen equations, to be precise. Seventeen
equations that, given sufficient initial data, could model the
electrochemical state of a human brain at any future moment.

Could model it, in principle. In practice, the initial data requirements
were monstrous. You needed a complete synaptic map, a real-time
neurochemical profile, and a measurement of the brain's electromagnetic
field accurate to twelve decimal places. The first two were merely
difficult. The third was, by the standards of 1987, impossible.

Or rather, it had been impossible until the previous October, when a
doctoral student named Wei-Lin Park had, almost by accident, invented a
magnetometric sensor of extraordinary sensitivity. Park had been trying to
detect subtle variations in the Earth's magnetic field. What she had built
instead was an instrument that could read the magnetic signature of a
thinking brain from across a room.

Alena had requisitioned three of the Park sensors within a week of the
publication. They arrived in February, packed in foam, each one smaller
than a shoebox. By March she had integrated them into the scanning array
in Laboratory Four. By April she had collected complete datasets from
fourteen volunteer subjects -- graduate students, mostly, lured with modest
stipends and the promise of contributing to history.

It was now the seventeenth of May, a Friday, and Alena was staring at a
computer screen that contained the most extraordinary result in the history
of neuroscience.

The Voss Transform worked.

Subject Nine -- a twenty-three-year-old mathematics graduate student named
David Kerr -- had been scanned on Monday. The seventeen equations had been
loaded with his neural data and run forward forty-eight hours. The model
had predicted, in precise mathematical terms, the electrochemical state of
David Kerr's brain at 2:00 PM on Wednesday.

On Wednesday at 2:00 PM, David Kerr had been scanned again.

The predicted state and the observed state matched to nine decimal places.

Alena stared at the numbers. She had checked them four times. She had run
the comparison algorithm twice, once on the laboratory's mainframe and once
on her personal workstation. The result was unambiguous.

For forty-eight hours, she had known what David Kerr would be thinking
before David Kerr thought it.

Not in vague terms. Not "David will be hungry" or "David will think about
mathematics." In exact terms. The precise pattern of neural activation in
every region of his brain. The specific concentrations of dopamine,
serotonin, acetylcholine, and forty-three other neurotransmitters at every
synapse. The complete electromagnetic signature of his consciousness, down
to the twelfth decimal place.

She had, in effect, possessed a perfect copy of David Kerr's mind -- a
copy that ran two days ahead of the original.

The implications were -- she paused, searching for the appropriate word,
and found that no word in any of her four languages was adequate. The
implications were beyond language. They were mathematical in their enormity,
and only mathematics could contain them.

She saved the file, locked the workstation, and went to stand by the window.

The Rensselaer campus spread below her in the May afternoon light: redbrick
buildings, green quadrangles, students moving in loose clusters along paved
paths. She watched them without seeing them. Her mind was performing
calculations of a different order.

If the Voss Transform could predict a brain state forty-eight hours in
advance, it could predict it a week in advance. A month. A year. The
equations were deterministic. Given sufficient precision in the initial
conditions, there was no theoretical limit to the prediction horizon.

This meant one of two things. Either human consciousness was, at its most
fundamental level, a deterministic system -- a clockwork mechanism of
sublime complexity but no genuine freedom -- or the Voss Transform was
wrong.

Alena had spent eleven years building the Voss Transform. She had checked
every derivation, tested every assumption, challenged every inference. The
mathematics was sound. The experimental result confirmed it.

Therefore, human consciousness was deterministic.

Therefore, free will was an illusion.

Therefore, David Kerr's belief that he had chosen to think about topology
at 2:00 PM on Wednesday was incorrect. He had not chosen. The choice had
been determined by the state of his brain on Monday, which had been
determined by the state of his brain on the previous Saturday, which had
been determined by an unbroken causal chain stretching back to the initial
conditions of the universe.

Alena leaned her forehead against the cool glass. The enormity of it
pressed against her like a physical weight.

She was not, by temperament, a woman given to philosophical crisis. She was
a physicist. She dealt in measurements and equations, not in questions of
meaning. But the Voss Transform had delivered her, without warning, into
the deepest philosophical question that had ever been asked, and had
answered it with the finality of a mathematical proof.

No freedom. No choice. The universe was a calculation, and human beings
were intermediate results.

She closed her eyes. After a long moment, she opened them.

There was one test remaining. The obvious test. The test she had been
avoiding since Monday, when the first comparison had shown the match.

She would run the Voss Transform on herself.


II.

The scanning procedure required approximately forty minutes. Alena had
performed it dozens of times on the volunteer subjects, and the protocol
was routine: lie on the padded table, remain still, allow the Park sensors
and the conventional scanning array to map the brain in overlapping layers
of increasing resolution.

She had never scanned herself. There was no technical reason for this
omission; the procedure was non-invasive and painless. The reason was
personal, and she recognized it as irrational even as she acknowledged its
power. There was something intimate about the scan, something that felt
like being read. The subjects often reported a sense of exposure, as though
their thoughts were being observed. They were not, of course -- the scan
captured physical states, not subjective experiences -- but the feeling
persisted.

Alena prepared the laboratory on Saturday morning, when the building was
empty. She calibrated the sensors, initialized the recording systems, and
programmed the mainframe to execute the Voss Transform automatically once
the scan was complete. The prediction horizon she set at seventy-two hours:
the model would predict the state of her brain at 10:00 AM on Tuesday.

She lay down on the table, positioned her head within the sensor array,
and pressed the start button on the remote control.

The scan proceeded in silence. The Park sensors emitted no sound; the
conventional array produced only a faint hum. Alena lay still, staring at
the acoustic ceiling tiles, and tried not to think about what was happening.

This, of course, was futile. She thought about the scan. She thought about
David Kerr's astonished face when she had told him about the result (she
had told him nothing about the prediction, only that his scan data had been
"particularly clean"). She thought about her apartment, and the stack of
unread journals on the kitchen table, and the letter from her mother in
Prague that she had not yet answered.

She thought about Erik.

Erik Lindqvist. Tall, fair, Swedish. A theoretical physicist at MIT, a
collaborator on two published papers, a lover for nine months during her
second year at Rensselaer. He had ended it -- gently, regretfully, with
the careful precision of a man who had rehearsed the conversation -- in
March of the previous year. The reason he gave was distance. The reason
Alena intuited was something else: a fundamental incompatibility of
temperament. Erik was warm where Alena was cool. Spontaneous where she was
measured. He had once told her, during a weekend in Vermont, that talking
to her was like talking to a beautiful equation -- elegant, complete, and
impervious to revision.

She had understood this as a compliment. She had been wrong.

The scan ended with a soft chime. Alena sat up, swung her legs off the
table, and walked to the workstation. The raw data was already loading into
the mainframe. The Voss Transform would require approximately six hours to
execute. She would have the prediction by evening.

She went home. She answered her mother's letter. She read two journal
articles and made notes in the margins. She ate a dinner of cold chicken
and salad, standing at the kitchen counter, looking out the window at the
darkening sky.

At 8:47 PM, the mainframe sent a completion notification to her home
terminal. Alena set down her fork, washed her hands, and sat at the desk
in the corner of her living room.

The prediction file was large -- 2.3 gigabytes of compressed data
describing, in the language of the seventeen equations, the complete state
of Alena Voss's brain at 10:00 AM on Tuesday the twentieth of May, 1987.

She did not open it.

Instead, she wrote herself a note on a yellow legal pad: "Tuesday 10 AM.
Think about something specific. Something the model cannot have anticipated
from Saturday's initial conditions."

She considered this for a moment, then crossed it out. The entire point of
the Voss Transform was that everything could be anticipated from the
initial conditions. If the model was correct, then whatever she chose to
think about on Tuesday was already determined. Her "choice" to think about
something surprising was itself predicted. Her effort to defeat the
prediction was part of the prediction.

She stared at the crossed-out note.

Then she wrote a new note: "Tuesday 10 AM. Be yourself."

She turned off the terminal and went to bed.


III.

The weekend passed. Alena did not open the prediction file. She went to the
laboratory on Monday, supervised three graduate students, attended a
department meeting, and ate lunch alone in her office. She did not think
about the prediction. Or rather, she thought about not thinking about the
prediction, which was itself a form of thinking about it, a recursive loop
of metacognition that she recognized as characteristic of her mental
architecture and which, she acknowledged, was almost certainly captured in
the model with perfect fidelity.

On Tuesday morning, she arrived at the laboratory at 9:15. She sat at the
workstation in Laboratory Four. She opened the prediction file.

The data was dense but legible, once you knew the notation. The Voss
Transform expressed brain states as vectors in a seventeen-dimensional
phase space, each dimension corresponding to one of the coupled equations.
The predicted state at 10:00 AM was a single point in this space: a set of
seventeen numbers, each specified to twelve decimal places.

Alena read the numbers. They meant nothing to her in their raw form; the
phase space was abstract, and the correspondence between mathematical
coordinates and subjective experience was not yet established. She could
not look at the predicted vector and say, "At 10:00 AM I will be thinking
about Erik" or "At 10:00 AM I will be worried about the department
meeting." The model predicted physical states, not qualia.

But she could compare the predicted state to an observed state.

At 9:58, she lay down on the scanning table. At 9:59, she pressed the
start button. The scan would take four minutes; the midpoint -- the moment
of highest resolution -- would fall at 10:01, close enough to the
prediction time that the comparison would be valid within the model's error
margins.

She lay still. She breathed. She let her mind do whatever it wished.

What it wished, apparently, was to think about a summer afternoon in Prague
when she was seven years old, sitting in her grandmother's garden, watching
a beetle crawl along the rim of a flowerpot. The beetle was iridescent
green, its carapace gleaming like enamel in the sunlight. Her grandmother
was singing in the kitchen -- something in Czech, an old song, the melody
simple and descending. The air smelled of linden blossoms and warm stone.

The memory was vivid and unbidden. Alena had not thought about her
grandmother's garden in years. She did not choose to think about it now;
it simply arrived, like a bird alighting on a branch, and she watched it
with the same passive attention.

The scan chimed. She sat up.

Her hands were steady as she loaded the observed data and initiated the
comparison algorithm. The program would calculate the Euclidean distance
between the predicted vector and the observed vector in the seventeen-
dimensional phase space. A distance of zero would mean perfect agreement.
The David Kerr comparison had yielded a distance of 0.000000003 --
effectively zero, well within measurement uncertainty.

The program ran for eleven seconds. The result appeared on the screen.

Distance: 4.7192.

Alena blinked.

She read the number again. 4.7192. Not 0.0000047192. Not 0.00047192. The
number 4.7192, with no leading zeros.

In the context of the Voss Transform's phase space, a distance of 4.7192
was enormous. It was not a small deviation, not a rounding error, not a
sensor malfunction. It was a distance comparable to the difference between
the brain of a person who was awake and the brain of a person who was in
deep sleep. It was, in mathematical terms, a completely different brain
state.

The prediction had failed. Spectacularly, catastrophically failed.

Alena's first thought was sensor error. She checked the calibration logs.
All three Park sensors had been operating within normal parameters. The
conventional scanning array showed no anomalies.

Her second thought was a software bug. She re-ran the comparison algorithm.
The result was identical: 4.7192.

Her third thought was that the Voss Transform itself was wrong -- that the
success with David Kerr had been a fluke, a coincidence, a statistical
artifact.

But she had run the transform on fourteen subjects. Twelve of the fourteen
showed prediction accuracies comparable to David Kerr's. Two showed modest
deviations, both attributable to identified measurement errors. The Voss
Transform worked. She had verified it exhaustively.

It worked on everyone.

Everyone except Alena Voss.

She sat very still at the workstation. The cursor blinked. The ventilation
system hummed. Somewhere in the building, a door closed.

She ran the transform again, using the Tuesday scan data as initial
conditions and a twenty-four-hour prediction horizon. If the model was
simply wrong about her -- if her neural architecture had some anomaly that
the equations failed to capture -- then the new prediction should also
fail, and the failure should be similar in character.

The transform completed in six hours. At four in the afternoon, she scanned
herself again and ran the comparison.

Distance: 0.000000007.

Near-perfect agreement.

The Voss Transform worked on Alena Voss. It worked on Tuesday's data just
as well as it worked on David Kerr's. The equations captured her neural
architecture with the same fidelity they captured everyone else's.

It had failed only once: the prediction from Saturday to Tuesday.

Alena leaned back in her chair. The implications unfolded in her mind with
the inexorable logic of a mathematical proof, and she did not like where
they led.

The Voss Transform was deterministic. Given an initial state, it predicted
a unique future state. If the prediction failed, there were only two
possible explanations.

One: the initial state was measured incorrectly. She had ruled this out.

Two: something had intervened between the initial state and the predicted
state. Something that was not captured by the seventeen equations. Something
external to the system.

But the system was her brain. The seventeen equations modeled every known
physical process that occurred within a human brain. Electrochemistry.
Thermodynamics. Quantum effects at the synaptic level. There was nothing
external to the system, because the system included everything.

Unless the system did not include everything.

Unless there was something in Alena Voss's brain -- or acting upon Alena
Voss's brain -- that was not captured by any known physical process.

She stood up. She walked to the window. The campus was quiet in the late
afternoon light.

Either the Voss Transform was wrong, which the evidence contradicted, or
Alena Voss was not entirely a physical system.

Or -- and this was the thought that made her grip the windowsill until her
knuckles whitened -- Alena Voss was not the person she believed herself
to be.


IV.

She did not sleep well that night. In the morning, she called in sick --
something she had done twice in eleven years -- and drove to the campus
library. She was not looking for neuroscience. She was looking for
philosophy.

The relevant literature was vast, and Alena was not trained to navigate it.
She spent the morning reading about the mind-body problem, about Cartesian
dualism, about Chalmers's "hard problem" of consciousness, about Penrose's
speculations on quantum effects in microtubules. None of it helped. The
philosophers asked beautiful questions but provided no equations. The
physicists provided equations but asked the wrong questions.

At noon she returned to the laboratory and ran a new experiment.

She scanned herself -- a fresh initial state. She ran the transform forward
twenty-four hours. Then she did something she had never done with any
subject: she ran the transform backward.

The Voss equations, like all deterministic systems, were time-reversible.
Given a brain state at time T, the equations could calculate the state at
T-minus-one just as easily as T-plus-one. In principle, you could take a
scan of a person's brain and calculate what their brain had been doing
yesterday, last week, last year.

Alena ran the reverse transform on her Saturday scan. She asked the
equations to calculate the state of her brain twenty-four hours before the
scan -- Friday evening, roughly 10:00 PM.

She remembered Friday evening. She had been at home, eating leftover soup
and reading a paper by Hofstadter. A quiet evening. Nothing remarkable.

The reverse prediction completed. She compared it to what she knew of
her own Friday-evening mental state. The comparison was subjective --
she had no scan data from Friday evening -- but the predicted
neurochemical profile was consistent with relaxed wakefulness, mild
intellectual engagement, and a low level of background anxiety. That
sounded right.

She ran the reverse transform further: forty-eight hours back. Thursday
evening. She had been at the laboratory late, debugging the comparison
algorithm. The predicted profile showed elevated cortisol, focused
attention, mild frustration. Also consistent.

She ran it back a week. The predictions remained plausible.

She ran it back a month.

The predictions remained plausible.

She ran it back a year.

Here, the reverse transform began to strain. The error accumulation over
twelve months of backward projection was significant, and the predicted
states became increasingly blurred -- not wrong, exactly, but imprecise,
like a photograph slightly out of focus.

She ran it back two years.

The prediction snapped.

Not gradually, not with increasing blur, but suddenly, like a rubber band
stretched past its limit. The predicted brain state for May 1985 -- two
years before the scan -- was not a blurred version of a plausible state. It
was nonsense. Mathematical nonsense. The seventeen-dimensional vector
contained values that were physically impossible: negative neurotransmitter
concentrations, electromagnetic field strengths that violated conservation
laws, a synaptic connectivity pattern that corresponded to no known
biological structure.

Alena stared at the screen.

The reverse transform worked on the other subjects. She checked: David
Kerr's data, run backward two years, produced a blurred but physically
plausible brain state. So did the other thirteen subjects. The equations
were well-behaved in reverse, for everyone except her.

For Alena, the backward projection collapsed into impossibility at
approximately the twenty-six-month mark.

Twenty-six months ago was March 1985.

Alena sat at the workstation and tried to remember March 1985. She had
been at Rensselaer for three years at that point. She had published two
papers. She had been seeing Erik for -- she calculated -- four months.

She remembered March 1985 perfectly well. She remembered a late snowstorm
that knocked out power to the campus for two days. She remembered a
seminar she gave on the early version of the Voss Transform. She
remembered Erik cooking paella in her kitchen, the saffron staining his
fingers yellow.

She remembered all of this. But the Voss Transform said that the brain
which remembered it -- the brain she carried in her skull at this very
moment -- could not have existed in March 1985.

According to the mathematics, Alena Voss's brain had begun existing
approximately twenty-six months ago. Before that point, there was no
physically consistent prior state. Her brain had not developed from an
earlier brain. It had simply appeared, fully formed, loaded with memories
of a life it had not lived.

The word came to her slowly, rising from the depths of her scientific
vocabulary like a bubble from the bottom of a dark lake.

Discontinuity.


V.

She told no one. Whom would she tell? The result was incomprehensible,
and the incomprehensible does not survive peer review.

Instead, she worked. For three weeks she worked with a focus that excluded
sleep, food, and all social contact. She refined the reverse transform.
She improved the error-correction algorithms. She developed new diagnostic
tools to probe the boundary -- the exact moment at which the backward
projection ceased to be physically meaningful.

The boundary sharpened. It was not March 1985. It was the fourteenth of
March, 1985, at approximately 3:00 AM Eastern Standard Time.

Alena searched her memories for the fourteenth of March, 1985. She found
nothing remarkable. A Thursday. She had gone to the laboratory in the
morning, worked until five, gone home, made dinner, read a chapter of a
novel -- she could not remember which novel -- and gone to bed.

An ordinary day. The most ordinary day. A day so featureless that it was
almost suspicious in its ordinariness, as though it had been designed to be
unmemorable.

She pulled her personal records. Her calendar for March 1985 showed nothing
unusual. Her laboratory notebook recorded routine measurements. Her credit
card statements showed a purchase at the campus bookstore -- $14.95, a
hardcover, title unknown -- and a charge at the local grocery -- $23.41,
items unknown.

She requested her medical records from the campus health service. She had
visited the clinic on March 11th for a routine check-up. Blood pressure,
blood work, the usual. All normal.

Nothing. No accident, no surgery, no head injury, no unexplained gap in
the record. The fourteenth of March, 1985, was a perfectly normal day in
the perfectly normal life of Dr. Alena Voss.

A perfectly normal day on which, according to the most rigorous
mathematical model of consciousness ever constructed, her brain had
spontaneously materialized.

She began to consider hypotheses.

Hypothesis one: the reverse transform was numerically unstable, and the
"discontinuity" was an artifact of accumulated computational error. She
tested this by running the reverse transform on simulated data with known
initial conditions. The simulation showed no discontinuity at any time
horizon. Hypothesis rejected.

Hypothesis two: her brain contained a structural anomaly -- a tumor, a
lesion, a developmental irregularity -- that the forward transform could
accommodate but the reverse transform could not. She booked an MRI at the
university hospital, under the pretext of a persistent headache. The MRI
was clean. No anomalies of any kind. Hypothesis rejected.

Hypothesis three: the discontinuity was real. Her brain, as a physical
system, had no consistent history before March 14, 1985. Her memories of
before that date were -- something. Implanted, constructed, false. Real in
the subjective sense but not in the physical sense.

This hypothesis could not be rejected. It was consistent with all the data.

Alena sat in her office at eleven o'clock at night and looked at the framed
photograph on her desk. The photograph showed a woman in her sixties,
silver-haired, smiling, standing in a garden in Prague. Her mother. Jana
Voss, nee Horakova. The woman who had raised her, taught her mathematics,
sat with her through childhood fevers, driven her to the airport when she
left for America.

If hypothesis three was correct, Alena had never met this woman. The
memories of her mother were artifacts, indistinguishable from genuine
experience but manufactured. Loaded into a brain that had appeared in the
small hours of a March morning in a rented apartment in Troy, New York.

She picked up the telephone and dialed her mother's number in Prague. It
was five in the morning there, but Jana was an early riser. The phone rang
three times.

"Haló?"

"Maminko. It's Alena."

"Alenka! Is everything all right? You sound strange."

"I'm fine. I just -- wanted to hear your voice."

"At this hour? You're working too hard again. Are you eating?"

"Yes, Maminko."

"You're not eating. I can hear it in your voice. You're living on coffee
and those terrible American sandwiches."

Alena closed her eyes. The voice was perfect. Every inflection, every
rhythmic pattern, every characteristic locution was exactly as she
remembered. Her mother. Her real mother. The woman who existed, who lived
in Prague, who could be visited and embraced and argued with.

But the Voss Transform did not say that Jana Voss was unreal. It said that
Alena's memories of Jana Voss had no physical basis before March 14, 1985.
Jana herself might be perfectly real. Alena's childhood in Prague might have
happened -- to someone else. Or to no one. The memories could have been
constructed from whole cloth, or copied from another mind, or generated by
a process Alena could not imagine.

"Maminko. Do you remember when I was seven? In your garden? There was a
beetle on a flowerpot."

A pause. "A beetle?"

"A green beetle. Iridescent. You were singing in the kitchen."

"Alenka, I don't remember every beetle from thirty years ago. But yes, you
spent hours in that garden. You were always watching the insects. You said
they were tiny machines."

"Tiny machines. Yes. I remember."

She remembered. But the Voss Transform said the remembering brain had not
been there.

"Go to bed, Alenka. Call me on Sunday, at a reasonable hour."

"Yes, Maminko. Good night."

She hung up. She sat in the dark office for a long time.


VI.

Two hypotheses remained, and Alena Voss was not the kind of scientist who
could leave a question unanswered.

The first hypothesis was that she was, in some sense, artificial. That the
entity called Alena Voss had been created -- by whom, for what purpose, by
what means -- on March 14, 1985, equipped with a complete set of false
memories and inserted into a pre-existing life. This hypothesis was
extraordinary in the extreme, but it was consistent with the data. It
implied the existence of a technology so far beyond current science that it
was functionally indistinguishable from magic: the ability to construct a
human brain in its entirety, complete with a lifetime of encoded
experience.

The second hypothesis was stranger still. It was the possibility that Alena
had considered and rejected and reconsidered and been unable to fully
dismiss.

The Voss Transform modeled consciousness as a deterministic physical
system. It worked perfectly on fourteen out of fifteen subjects, both
forward and backward in time. On the fifteenth subject -- Alena herself --
it worked perfectly forward but collapsed backward at a specific moment.

What if the discontinuity was not in her brain, but in her consciousness?

What if the Voss Transform was, without Alena's intention or awareness,
detecting the boundary between physical brain states and something else?
What if Alena Voss's brain, before March 14, 1985, had been running on
the same deterministic physics as everyone else's -- but on that date,
something non-physical had entered the system? Something that the equations
could not reverse-engineer because it was not subject to the equations?

Something that, in the philosophical literature, might be called a soul.

Alena was not religious. She had been raised in a secular household in a
secular country. She had no framework for thinking about souls, no
vocabulary, no intuitions. The concept was as foreign to her as Sanskrit
calligraphy.

But the mathematics led where it led. And the mathematics said that
something had happened to Alena Voss on March 14, 1985, that was not
reducible to physics.

She leaned back in her chair and stared at the ceiling. The fluorescent
light hummed. The building was silent.

She was a scientist. She dealt in evidence, not in speculation. The
evidence said that her brain's history was physically inconsistent before a
specific date. The evidence did not say why. The evidence did not say
"soul" or "artificial" or "alien intervention" or any other narrative. The
evidence said only: here is a discontinuity. Here is a boundary beyond
which the equations do not hold. Here be dragons.

She could publish the result. The Voss Transform -- the forward prediction
-- would revolutionize neuroscience, philosophy, and law. It would ignite
debates about free will, moral responsibility, criminal justice, and the
nature of consciousness that would rage for decades. The backward-
prediction anomaly -- her anomaly -- would be a footnote, a curiosity, a
datum awaiting explanation.

Or she could investigate the anomaly. She could scan more subjects, hundreds
of subjects, and run the reverse transform on all of them. If she was the
only discontinuity, that meant one thing. If there were others, it meant
something else entirely.

She thought about David Kerr, whose thoughts she had predicted with
twelve-decimal-place accuracy. David Kerr, who believed he was a free
agent making choices about his life, and who was in fact a mechanism of
sublime complexity executing a program written at the beginning of time.

She thought about herself, who was apparently not a mechanism. Who was,
according to the mathematics, something more than -- or other than -- a
physical system.

She should have been elated. She was the exception. She was the proof that
determinism was not absolute, that consciousness was not merely clockwork,
that there was something in the universe that transcended equations.

She was not elated.

She was terrified.

Because if she was the exception, then she was alone. Alone in a way that
no human being had ever been alone. Alone in the way that a single
irrational number is alone in an infinite field of integers. She was
different in kind, not merely in degree, from every other person she had
ever known.

Erik had said that talking to her was like talking to a beautiful equation.
He had been wrong. She was not an equation. She was the error term. The
noise in the signal. The datum that did not fit.

She thought about her mother's voice on the telephone. Maminko. The most
real thing she knew. The most real thing she remembered. And the memory
might be -- probably was -- a fabrication.

But the love in it. The love she felt when she heard that voice. Was the
love fabricated too?

Could you fabricate love? Could you construct it from neurochemistry and
synaptic weights, load it into a brain like data into a computer, and have
it be indistinguishable from the real thing?

The Voss Transform said yes. The Voss Transform said that love, like
everything else, was a physical state, and physical states could be
predicted, replicated, and presumably manufactured.

But the Voss Transform did not work on Alena.

Which meant -- what? That her love was real? That it originated from the
non-physical component, the discontinuity, the soul?

Or that it was an even more sophisticated fabrication, one that transcended
mere physics?

She did not know. The equations did not say. The equations, for the first
time in eleven years, had nothing to say to her at all.


VII.

On a Thursday evening in late June, Alena Voss made her decision.

She had spent six weeks scanning additional subjects. Forty-seven new
volunteers, bringing the total to sixty-one. She had run the reverse
transform on all of them, pushing backward as far as the accumulated error
would allow.

Three others showed discontinuities.

Subject Twenty-Two: a forty-one-year-old English professor named Margaret
Okonkwo. Discontinuity at approximately eighteen months before the scan.

Subject Thirty-Nine: a nineteen-year-old undergraduate named James Petrie.
Discontinuity at approximately four years.

Subject Fifty-Five: a sixty-seven-year-old retired janitor named Harold
Blum. Discontinuity at approximately thirty-one years.

Four out of sixty-one. Roughly six and a half percent.

Four people whose brains, according to the most precise model of
consciousness ever constructed, had no physically consistent history before
a specific moment.

Four people who were, in the language of the Voss Transform, discontinuous.

Alena had not told any of them. She was not sure she ever would. What would
she say? "Excuse me, my equations indicate that you may not be entirely
real"? The social protocol for such a conversation did not exist.

But she had begun to observe them. Not intrusively -- she was not
following them or reading their mail -- but attentively, with the focused
curiosity of a scientist studying an unfamiliar phenomenon. And she had
noticed something.

They were all, in their different ways, unusual people.

Margaret Okonkwo was a brilliant literary critic whose essays had a quality
of insight that went beyond analysis -- a capacity to see what an author
meant at a level deeper than the author's conscious intention. Her
colleagues described her as "uncanny."

James Petrie was a freshman who had arrived at Rensselaer with no
distinguishing characteristics and had, within a semester, become the most
gifted mathematics student in the department's history. His professors
described his abilities as "coming from nowhere."

Harold Blum was a retired janitor who, in his off-hours, painted
watercolors of extraordinary beauty. He had never taken a lesson. He had
never visited a museum. He painted what he saw, and what he saw was
apparently invisible to everyone else: light falling through clouds in
configurations that seemed to reveal the mathematical structure of the
atmosphere.

Four discontinuous people. Four people with inexplicable gifts. Four
people who, if you believed the mathematics, had arrived in the world
fully formed at specific moments, carrying memories of lives they had not
lived, equipped with capacities that had no developmental history.

Alena thought about this for a long time. She thought about it in the
laboratory and at home and during the long walks she took in the evenings
along the wooded paths behind the campus.

Then she made her decision.

She would not publish the Voss Transform.

She sat at her workstation and deleted the prediction files. She deleted
David Kerr's data and the data of all sixty-one subjects. She deleted the
code for the reverse transform and the forward transform and the comparison
algorithms. She deleted her laboratory notebooks -- the digital ones --
and carried the paper ones to the incinerator behind the chemistry building
and burned them.

She kept nothing. Eleven years of work, reduced to ash and zeroed hard
drives in a single evening.

It was not a sacrifice. It was a choice -- the first genuinely free choice,
she reflected, that she could be certain of making. Free because the Voss
Transform could not predict it. Free because she was discontinuous, and
discontinuous beings were not bound by the deterministic equations that
governed the merely physical.

She had considered publishing only the forward prediction -- the proof
that consciousness was deterministic -- without mentioning the anomalies.
But the anomalies were the truth. The forward prediction was the lesser
truth, and publishing a lesser truth while concealing a greater one was,
in Alena's moral algebra, indistinguishable from a lie.

She had considered publishing everything. But the implications were
dangerous. If it became known that six and a half percent of the population
was "discontinuous" -- different in kind from the rest -- the consequences
would be catastrophic. History provided abundant evidence of what happened
when one group of humans was declared fundamentally different from another.

And there was a deeper reason. A reason that was not scientific but personal
and, Alena admitted, possibly sentimental.

David Kerr believed he was free. He believed he made choices. He believed
that his decision to study topology, his affection for his girlfriend, his
preference for chocolate ice cream over vanilla were expressions of a
genuine self, a self that was the author of its own story.

The Voss Transform said he was wrong. The Voss Transform said David Kerr
was a mechanism, and his sense of freedom was a beautiful illusion.

But it was a beautiful illusion. And Alena was not willing to destroy it.

Let David Kerr believe he was free. Let him live in the warmth of that
belief, making his choices and loving his girlfriend and eating his
chocolate ice cream, untroubled by the knowledge that every thought in his
head had been determined since the beginning of time.

And let Alena Voss -- the discontinuity, the error term, the singularity
-- carry the knowledge alone.

She locked the laboratory. She walked home through the June evening, the
air soft and warm, the stars appearing one by one above the campus. She
felt, for the first time in months, something that resembled peace.

She did not know what she was. She did not know where she had come from, or
who -- or what -- had placed her in a rented apartment in Troy, New York,
on a March night two and a half years ago, equipped with thirty-four years
of memories and a gift for mathematics and an ache in her chest where Erik
Lindqvist used to be.

But she knew that the love she felt for her mother was real. She knew it
because the equations could not account for it. She knew it because it
existed outside the system, beyond the reach of the seventeen variables,
in the unmapped territory where the mathematics dissolved into silence.

The beetle on the flowerpot. The song in the kitchen. The smell of linden
blossoms and warm stone.

Perhaps they had never happened. Perhaps she had never been a seven-year-
old girl in a garden in Prague.

But she remembered them. And the remembering was hers.

That, she decided, was enough.

She walked home beneath the emergent stars, and she did not look back.

============================================================================
                          GUNSLINGER'S MOON
                           by Rex Drummond
============================================================================

I.

The bullet hit the water tower at the exact moment Cole Braddock lit his
cigarette. He didn't flinch. You didn't last long on the Kepler frontier
if you flinched at every stray round.

He cupped the flame, drew deep, and exhaled smoke into the thin, copper-
tinted air of Kepler-7b. The sun -- a bloated orange K-type star the
settlers called Old Ugly -- hung low on the western horizon, painting the
alkali flats the color of dried blood. Two moons were up. The big one,
Juno, sat fat and yellow above the mesa. The little one, the fast one the
miners called the Bullet, was just clearing the eastern ridge, moving so
quick you could almost watch it track across the sky.

Another round smacked the tower. This one punched clean through the sheet
metal and sent a stream of recycled water arcing into the dust. Somewhere
behind the processing plant, a man screamed -- high and sharp and cut off
fast, the way they always were when it was bad.

Braddock pulled his duster back from the holster on his right hip. The
pistol there was a Remington Mk-VII Pacifier, military surplus, chambered
in 8mm caseless. It could put a round through six inches of tempered steel
at a hundred yards. On a planet where the atmosphere was thirty percent
thinner than Earth's, it could do it at a hundred and fifty.

He'd killed eleven men with that gun. Twelve if you counted the one on
Barnard's Landing who'd taken three days to die, and Braddock counted him
because three days of waiting for a man to stop breathing was worse than
pulling the trigger.

The settlement of Redemption -- and Lord, wasn't that a name -- huddled in
the shadow of the mesa like a dog against a wall. Forty prefab structures,
a processing plant, a water recycler, and a landing pad that hadn't seen a
ship in six weeks. Population: three hundred and twelve souls, give or
take, most of them miners pulling rare earths out of the mesa for the
Kepler Development Corporation. KDC had the charter. KDC had the mining
rights. KDC had the guns.

Braddock was one of the guns.

He'd been hired six months ago, when the raids started. Someone was hitting
the outlying claims -- smashing equipment, stealing processed ore, leaving
behind a mess of boot prints that didn't look quite right. The prints were
too narrow, the toes too long, the stride too short for a human gait. The
miners had their theories. Claim jumpers wearing trick boots. Corporate
saboteurs from the Sirius Combine. The Kepler wind playing games with the
alkali dust.

Braddock hadn't had a theory. He'd had a contract: twelve months, fifteen
hundred credits a month plus combat bonuses, protect the settlement, shoot
what needed shooting. He hadn't asked who or what he'd be shooting. In his
line of work, that kind of curiosity was a luxury.

He stubbed out the cigarette on the heel of his boot and moved.

The processing plant was a long, low building with corrugated walls and
a roof that collected condensation for the recycler. Braddock went around
the back, fast and low, the Remington up and tracking. The screaming had
stopped. That was usually worse than when it kept going.

He found Ike Washburn lying face-down in the alkaline dust behind the
loading dock. Ike was a shift foreman, fifty-odd years old, built like a
barrel. He wasn't built like a barrel anymore. Something had opened him
from hip to shoulder, and the inside of Ike Washburn was steaming in the
cool evening air.

Braddock knelt. He didn't touch the body. He studied the wound. It wasn't
a bullet wound and it wasn't a blade wound. It was a tear, jagged and
irregular, like something had reached into Ike and pulled. The edges of the
flesh were -- he looked closer -- the edges were cauterized. Burned clean,
even as the tearing happened.

He'd seen a wound like that once before. On Tau Ceti e, during the Border
Suppression. The Tau Ceti indigenes had weapons that combined kinetic force
with thermal energy -- a kind of ripping heat that tore and burned
simultaneously. The Colonial Marines had called them "hellclaws."

Braddock stood up. He looked at the mesa, rising dark and massive against
the orange sky. The mesa was riddled with tunnels -- natural caves expanded
by the mining operation, extending deep into the rock. The raiders always
came from the mesa. The raiders always disappeared into the mesa.

He turned and walked back toward the main street, past the water tower with
its two new bullet holes, past the company store with its shuttered windows,
past the clinic where Doc Okafor was already laying out his instruments
with the resigned efficiency of a man who'd done too many patch jobs.

Sheriff Tom Bryce was standing in the middle of the street, a scatter-gun
in his hands and a look on his face like a man who'd just been told the
universe was bigger than he thought.

"Braddock. You see Washburn?"

"I saw him."

"Same as the others?"

"Same as the others."

Bryce spat into the dust. "That's seven in three months. KDC's going to
pull the charter if we can't stop this."

"KDC's not going to pull a charter that's netting them forty million
credits a year in rare earths."

"They'll bring in Marines."

"Maybe. Probably should have done that from the start."

Bryce looked at him with something between irritation and hope. "That's
what I'm paying you for, Braddock. To make sure they don't have to."

Braddock said nothing. He looked at the mesa. The fast moon -- the Bullet
-- was crossing its face now, a white dot moving visibly against the dark
rock. In twelve minutes it would be past and the mesa would be dark again.

"I'm going up there," he said.

"Into the mesa? At night?"

"They hit us at dusk every time. They're holed up in those tunnels. I go
now, while they're settling in, I might catch them off guard."

"Or you might catch a hellclaw in the gut."

Braddock shrugged. "That's what the combat bonus is for."


II.

The mesa was a different world at night.

By day it was rock and dust, iron-red and sun-blasted, scarred with mining
cuts and pocked with tunnel entrances. By night, under the twin moons, it
became something older. The rock fluoresced faintly -- a pale blue-green
glow, almost subliminal, that came from mineral deposits deep in the stone.
The effect was like walking through the skeleton of some vast, luminous
animal.

Braddock moved through the tunnels with the Remington in his right hand
and a lamp in his left, the beam cutting a white wedge through the blue
darkness. The tunnels branched and re-branched, a labyrinth of natural
caves and blasted-out mining corridors that extended, according to the
survey maps, more than eight miles into the mesa's heart.

He'd studied the maps. He'd memorized the branch points, the dead ends,
the places where the ceiling dropped low and you had to go on hands and
knees. He'd marked the spots where the raiders' tracks had been found --
those narrow, long-toed prints -- and plotted them on the map. The pattern
was clear: the raiders used the deep tunnels, the ones the miners hadn't
reached yet, the ones that went down instead of in.

He followed the pattern. Down.

The air changed as he descended. It grew warmer, moister, thicker with a
smell he couldn't quite place -- organic, faintly sweet, like overripe
fruit or fresh-cut grass. The fluorescence intensified. The walls shimmered.
In places, the mineral deposits formed structures that looked almost
deliberate: spirals, branching patterns, symmetries that suggested design
rather than geology.

At the third branch point, he found the shrine.

It was a natural chamber, roughly circular, maybe fifty feet across. The
ceiling rose to a dome lined with the glowing mineral, so that the whole
space was suffused with blue-green light, soft and even, like being inside
a lantern. In the center of the chamber stood a structure.

Braddock stopped. He turned off his lamp.

The structure was made of the same luminous stone, but it had been shaped.
Carved. Worked with tools and intention into a form that was unmistakably,
undeniably deliberate. It was a column, maybe eight feet tall, tapering to
a point, covered from base to tip with symbols. The symbols were intricate
-- curves and angles and dots arranged in patterns that repeated and varied,
like a language.

Around the base of the column, arranged in a circle, were objects. Small
objects, carefully placed. Braddock knelt to examine them without touching.
Stones, polished smooth. Fragments of the luminous mineral, shaped into
discs. What looked like dried flowers, pressed flat and arranged in fans.
And bones. Small bones, delicate, from an animal Braddock didn't recognize.

A shrine. An altar. A place of worship.

Braddock stood up slowly. He was a man of limited education and unlimited
practical intelligence, and the practical intelligence was screaming at him
now, telling him something he did not want to hear.

This was not a raider camp. This was not a hideout or a staging area or
a weapons cache.

This was a holy place.

He heard them before he saw them. A sound like breathing, but rhythmic,
synchronized, many lungs drawing and releasing in unison. It came from the
tunnel beyond the chamber, the tunnel that went deeper still, and it was
getting closer.

Braddock backed against the wall. He raised the Remington. He killed the
lamp and let the blue-green glow be his only light.

They came into the chamber in a single file, twelve of them, and they were
not human.

He'd known that. He'd known it since the boot prints, since the hellclaw
wounds, since the mineral formations that were too regular to be natural.
He'd known it and he'd filed the knowledge away in the part of his mind
where inconvenient truths went to wait, because acknowledging it would have
meant acknowledging that everything he'd been hired to do was wrong.

They were tall -- seven feet, maybe seven and a half -- and thin, built
on a frame that was humanoid but not human. Their skin was dark, matte,
like unglazed pottery. Their faces were long and narrow, with wide-set eyes
that caught the chamber's glow and reflected it back as steady blue points.
Their hands had six fingers, each one long and flexible as a tentacle, and
they moved with a fluid grace that made Braddock feel like a sack of bricks
on legs.

They were wearing robes. That was the detail that hit him hardest. Not
armor, not combat gear, not the utilitarian jumpsuit of a military force.
Robes, long and flowing, dyed in patterns of indigo and green. Ceremonial
garments. They had come here to worship.

They saw him at once. Twelve pairs of blue-glowing eyes fixed on him. The
breathing-rhythm broke. One of them -- the tallest, the one at the front
of the line -- made a sound. It wasn't a word, not in any language Braddock
spoke, but the meaning was clear in its cadence. A warning. A command.

Leave. This place is ours.

Braddock kept the Remington up. His finger was on the trigger. The gun
could drop six of them before the rest closed the distance. Maybe seven,
if he was fast and they were slow.

The tall one spoke again. Different cadence this time. Not a command. A
question.

Braddock understood none of the words and all of the meaning. The question
was: Why are you here?

And the answer -- the honest answer, the answer that Braddock felt rising
in his chest like bile -- was: Because a corporation pays me to kill you.

He lowered the gun.

"I'm leaving," he said. His voice sounded strange in the luminous chamber,
flat and small and human. "I'm going back up. I won't shoot."

He didn't know if they understood the words. But they understood the gun.
The tall one's eyes tracked the Remington as Braddock holstered it, and
something in those alien features shifted. Not trust -- something more
cautious than trust. Recognition, maybe. One predator acknowledging another.

Braddock walked backward out of the chamber, keeping his hands visible,
keeping his movements slow. When he reached the tunnel mouth he turned and
walked fast, not running -- running would be weakness -- but covering
ground, up through the branching corridors, up through the dimming
fluorescence, up into the cold copper air of the Kepler night.

He stood outside the tunnel entrance and looked down at Redemption. The
settlement's lights were small and yellow against the dark alkali flats.
Three hundred and twelve people. Miners, mostly. Working men and women
pulling metal out of someone else's rock for a wage that barely covered
the price of breathing imported air.

Below and behind him, in the heart of the mesa, twelve beings who had been
here first were praying to gods he would never understand, in tunnels that
had been their home since before humanity learned to make fire.

Braddock lit a cigarette. His hands were steady. They were always steady.
That was the problem with his line of work: the body didn't care about
right and wrong. The body cared about survival, and survival was Braddock's
particular talent.

He smoked and he thought and the moons moved above him.


III.

He went to see Anna Kessler in the morning.

Anna ran the company library, which was a grand name for a single room in
the back of the administrative building containing two hundred data-chips
and a reading terminal that crashed twice a day. But Anna had been on
Kepler-7b for four years -- longer than anyone except old Harold DuPont,
who'd come out on the first survey ship -- and she knew things that weren't
on the data-chips.

She was a small woman, dark-haired, with the pale complexion of someone
who spent too much time indoors and the sharp eyes of someone who spent
that time reading. Braddock liked her. She was one of the few people in
Redemption who didn't look at him like he was either a savior or a
necessary evil.

"The Keth," she said, when he described what he'd seen.

"The what?"

"The Keth. K-E-T-H. That's the name in the original survey report. The
indigenous population of Kepler-7b. Listed as 'pre-industrial, minimal
territorial range, non-threatening.' The survey team spent two weeks on
the surface, catalogued the flora and fauna, noted the Keth, and moved on.
KDC got the charter based on that survey."

"Non-threatening."

"That's what it says. I imagine the survey team didn't try to mine their
sacred mountain."

Braddock pulled up a chair and sat down. "Tell me about them."

Anna told him what she knew, which wasn't much and was probably incomplete.
The Keth were an old species -- how old was unclear, but the survey team
had found artifacts in deep caves that carbon-dated to at least forty
thousand years. They lived in small groups, rarely more than twenty, in
the cave systems of the mesas. They were tool-users but not technology-
builders; their tools were biological, grown rather than manufactured, and
included the thermal-kinetic weapons that Braddock had seen the effects of.

"Grown weapons?"

"Bioengineered. They cultivate a crystalline organism -- it's technically
a fungus -- that stores thermal energy and releases it on impact. The
survey report calls it 'a symbiotic weapon system of remarkable
sophistication.' The Keth grow them, bond with them, use them. The weapons
are apparently keyed to individual Keth; nobody else can activate them."

"And KDC knew about this when they set up the mine."

"KDC knew there was a pre-industrial indigenous population with biological
hand weapons. They assessed the threat level as low. The mesa was
classified as 'unclaimed geological resource.' The charter's legal."

"Legal." Braddock said the word the way you'd say "poisonous." He leaned
forward. "Anna. The mesa isn't just a mine to them. There's a shrine down
there. Carved stone, symbols, offerings. They go there to pray."

Anna was quiet for a moment. "That's not in the survey report."

"The survey team spent two weeks here and didn't go deep enough into the
tunnels to find it. They did a surface scan and called it done."

"If there's a sacred site..."

"Then KDC is mining a church. That's what you're saying."

Anna looked at him steadily. "What I'm saying, Mr. Braddock, is that the
Colonial Territories Act of 2089 includes a provision -- Section 14,
subsection 3 -- that prohibits the disturbance of indigenous sacred sites.
If the mesa contains a documented sacred site, KDC's mining charter could
be challenged."

"Challenged. Not revoked."

"Challenged. The process takes about two years and involves a tribunal on
Earth. During which time, the mining continues."

"And the Keth keep getting pushed deeper into their own mountain."

"Yes."

Braddock stood up. "Thanks, Anna."

"Cole." She used his first name so rarely that it stopped him at the door.
"What are you going to do?"

He thought about it. "I don't know yet."

That was a lie. He did know. He just wasn't ready to say it out loud.


IV.

The next raid came three nights later.

Braddock was ready for it. He was sitting on the roof of the processing
plant with the Remington across his knees and a pair of night-vision
binoculars pressed to his eyes when the Keth came down from the mesa.

There were eight of them this time. They moved like shadows -- fast, fluid,
nearly silent. They wore dark wrappings instead of the ceremonial robes,
and they carried their hellclaw weapons in both hands, the crystal tips
glowing faintly red in the darkness.

They headed straight for the primary mine shaft. Not the processing plant,
not the water tower, not the residential units. The mine shaft. The
entrance to their mountain.

Braddock watched them. He could have dropped four of them from this
position before they knew he was there. The combat bonus for four kills
would be six thousand credits. Six thousand credits would buy a lot of
quiet on a lot of quieter worlds.

He didn't shoot.

He watched them reach the mine shaft entrance. They stopped. The tallest
one -- the same one from the shrine, Braddock was sure of it -- pressed
both six-fingered hands against the rock face beside the entrance. The
others did the same, spreading out along the wall, touching the stone
with what Braddock could only describe as tenderness.

Then the tall one turned and looked directly at Braddock.

Across three hundred yards of darkness, through the night-vision green of
the binoculars, those blue-glowing eyes found him. Found him and held him.
The look was not hostile. It was not pleading. It was patient. It was the
look of someone who had been waiting a very long time and could wait longer
still.

One of the other Keth entered the mine shaft. A moment later, there was a
muffled sound -- half crack, half scream -- and the Keth came back out
dragging something. A piece of mining equipment. A drill assembly, heavy
and metallic, scarred with use. The Keth dropped it in the dust and raised
its hellclaw and brought it down.

The drill assembly came apart. The thermal-kinetic energy tore through
the casing and melted the internal components into slag. The Keth hit it
again, and again, and what had been a twenty-thousand-credit piece of
precision engineering was now a pile of glowing junk.

They did the same to two more pieces of equipment dragged from the shaft.
Then they turned and went back up the mesa, moving fast, disappearing into
the darkness like they'd been poured into it.

Braddock watched them go. He watched the last one -- the tall one, the
leader -- pause at the ridge line and look back one more time.

Then they were gone.

Braddock climbed down from the roof. Sheriff Bryce was already running
toward the mine shaft, scatter-gun up, three deputies behind him.

"Braddock! They hit the shaft! Why didn't you shoot?"

"Didn't have a clean angle," Braddock said. The lie came easy. Lies always
did.

"Didn't have a -- you were on the roof! That's why we put you on the roof!"

"They were in and out fast. By the time I had a bead, they were in the
rocks."

Bryce stared at him. Braddock stared back. After a moment, Bryce turned
away to survey the damage, swearing steadily and comprehensively.

Braddock walked back to his quarters. He sat on the edge of his bunk and
looked at the Remington. The gun was clean and oiled and ready, as always.
It was a good gun. It had never let him down.

He thought about the tall Keth's eyes. That patient, ancient gaze. That
look that said: We were here before you. We will be here after you. This
rock is our mother and our memory. Every tunnel is a vein, every chamber
a heartbeat. You are mining our body.

He thought about Ike Washburn, torn open behind the loading dock. He
thought about the six others who had died in three months. Working men,
most of them. Men who'd come to Kepler-7b because the jobs on Earth had
dried up, because the colonies were where the work was, because a man had
to feed his family somehow, even if it meant pulling rocks out of the
ground on a world with copper-colored air and two moons and an orange sun
that never looked like home.

Good men, some of them. Scared men, all of them. Men who didn't know they
were mining a church.

And the Keth. The Keth who hadn't started killing until KDC's drills hit
the deep tunnels, the sacred tunnels, the tunnels where the shrines were.
Who had probably tried other things first -- signals, warnings, displays
of force -- and been ignored or misunderstood. Who had finally done what
any people would do when their holy places were destroyed.

They had fought back.

Braddock understood fighting back. It was the one thing he understood
better than anything else in the universe.

He lay down on the bunk and stared at the ceiling and thought about
choices.

There was no right choice. That was the hell of it. If he sided with the
Keth, the miners would die or be driven off-world, and three hundred
families would lose their livelihoods. If he sided with the miners, the
Keth would lose their sacred mountain, their ancestral home, their history,
their gods. If he walked away, both sides would keep killing each other
until one side or the other was gone.

He thought about Section 14, subsection 3 of the Colonial Territories Act.
He thought about tribunals on Earth and two-year legal proceedings and the
mine running full bore the whole time.

He thought about Anna Kessler's sharp eyes and the way she'd said his
first name.

He thought about a shrine in a blue-green chamber and the sound of
synchronized breathing.

He didn't sleep.


V.

In the morning he went to see Garrett Lowe.

Lowe was KDC's on-site manager: a thin, precise man in a clean shirt who
smelled of aftershave and processed air. He had an office in the
administrative building -- the only private office in Redemption -- with a
real wooden desk that had been shipped from Earth at a cost that could have
fed a family for a year.

"The raiders are Keth," Braddock said without preamble. "Indigenous species.
Pre-colonial inhabitants. We're mining their sacred sites."

Lowe steepled his fingers. "I'm aware of the indigenous population, Mr.
Braddock. The survey report--"

"The survey report is garbage. Two weeks of surface observation. They
missed the deep tunnel system, they missed the shrines, they missed the
fact that the entire mesa is a holy site."

"Holy site is a strong term."

"I saw it. Carved stone, ritual objects, organized worship. These aren't
animals, Lowe. They're people."

"They're pre-industrial xenofauna. The charter--"

"The charter's based on a bad survey. Section 14 of the Colonial
Territories Act--"

"I'm familiar with Section 14." Lowe's voice was quiet but the temperature
in it dropped ten degrees. "And I'm familiar with you, Mr. Braddock. You're
a hired gun. You were not hired to interpret colonial law or to make
determinations about indigenous sovereignty. You were hired to protect this
settlement."

"Hard to protect a settlement from people defending their own land."

"Their land? KDC has the charter. This is KDC land."

Braddock leaned on the wooden desk with both hands. "Lowe. Listen to me.
Those Keth have been in that mesa for forty thousand years. They've got
weapons that can tear a man in half. So far they've been hitting equipment
and stragglers. If you keep drilling into their holy place, they'll hit the
settlement itself. All of it. Three hundred people."

"Which is why I'm paying you fifteen hundred a month."

"I can't stop them. Not alone. Not even with a squad. There are tunnels
under this settlement, Lowe. Tunnels we haven't mapped. They could come up
in the middle of the night, right through the floor of this office, and
there wouldn't be a damn thing I could do about it."

Lowe's face didn't change, but something behind his eyes shifted. A
calculation. The man was always calculating.

"What do you propose?"

"Pull back from the deep tunnels. Restrict mining to the upper levels --
the areas above the shrine complex. Stop drilling down. The rare-earth
deposits extend laterally as well as vertically; you can mine the upper
strata without touching their holy places."

"At significantly reduced yield."

"At enough yield to justify the charter. Maybe sixty percent of current
output."

"Sixty percent. Do you have any idea what the board will say?"

"I have a pretty good idea what the Keth will say if you don't."

Lowe sat back. He regarded Braddock for a long moment. "And how do we
communicate this... arrangement to the raiders?"

"Leave that to me."


VI.

He went into the mesa at dusk, alone and unarmed.

He'd left the Remington in his quarters. He'd left the knife, the
derringer in the boot holster, and the flashbang in the inner pocket of
his duster. He wore only his clothes and carried only a lamp.

It was the stupidest thing he'd ever done. And he'd done some spectacularly
stupid things in his thirty-eight years.

The tunnels were the same. The fluorescence, the sweet organic smell, the
branching corridors leading down. He followed the path he'd memorized,
down to the shrine chamber, and he sat on the stone floor in the blue-green
glow and he waited.

They came after two hours. Not twelve this time -- twenty. Perhaps more.
They filled the tunnels around the chamber, their dark shapes barely
visible beyond the light, their eyes catching and reflecting the glow.

The tall one entered the chamber. Up close, in the soft light, Braddock
could see details he'd missed before. The Keth's skin wasn't uniform dark;
it was patterned, subtly, with lighter striations that might have been age
marks or clan signs or something entirely beyond human categorization. Its
robes were different from the others' -- more elaborate, more heavily
patterned, with what looked like small crystals woven into the fabric.

A leader. A chief. A priest. Maybe all three.

It stood before Braddock and looked down at him. Its eyes were not just
blue -- they were layered, multiple depths of blue, like looking into deep
water.

Braddock spread his hands. Empty. No weapon, no tool, no threat.

"I don't know if you understand me," he said. "I don't know if you can
understand me. But I'm going to talk anyway, because talking is what
humans do when they're scared and they don't have a gun."

The tall Keth tilted its head. Listening.

"The mining stops in the deep tunnels. No more drilling below Level Four.
Your shrines, your holy places, they stay untouched. The upper levels, we
keep mining. We need the work. Our people need to eat, same as yours.
But we stay up top and you keep what's down here."

Silence. The synchronized breathing of twenty or more Keth, slow and steady.

"I know you've been trying to tell us. The raids, the attacks -- you were
telling us to stop. We didn't listen. I'm listening now."

The tall Keth made a sound. Low, resonant, almost musical. It reached out
one six-fingered hand and touched the nearest wall. The crystals in the
stone pulsed brighter, just for a moment.

Then it spoke.

Not in any human language. Not in any sound a human throat could make. But
the meaning came through -- not as words, not as thoughts, but as a
feeling, a vibration in the bones, a sudden wordless comprehension that
bypassed language entirely.

Home. This is home. The stone remembers us. We remember the stone.

And then: You. You are different. You smell of killing but you come without
killing. Why?

Braddock swallowed hard. "Because I've been the one on the other side. I've
been the one watching someone take what was mine. I didn't have hellclaws
or a holy mountain. I just had a gun and a bad attitude. But I know what
it feels like."

The tall Keth was silent for a long moment. Then it stepped forward and
placed its hand -- warm, dry, the six fingers strong as cable -- on
Braddock's shoulder.

Agreement. Conditional. You keep your word, we keep ours. Break faith and
the mountain will speak.

Braddock nodded. "Deal."

The Keth removed its hand. It turned and walked back toward the deeper
tunnels. The others followed, one by one, until Braddock was alone in the
glowing chamber with the carved column and the ritual objects and the
silence.

He sat there for a while. His hands were shaking. He clenched them into
fists and then released them and let them shake. Nobody was watching.
Nobody would know.

After a while, he stood up and walked back to the surface.


VII.

Lowe didn't like it. The board didn't like it. KDC's legal team sent a
seventeen-page memorandum explaining why negotiating with indigenous
xenofauna was beyond the scope of any settlement employee's authority and
potentially constituted an unauthorized modification of the charter terms.

Braddock didn't care. The deep drilling stopped. The upper-level mining
continued. The raids stopped.

Two months later, a Colonial Territories tribunal received an anonymous
filing documenting the presence of indigenous sacred sites within KDC's
mining concession on Kepler-7b. The filing included detailed survey data,
photographic evidence, and a legal brief citing Section 14, subsection 3.
Anna Kessler never admitted to preparing it, and Braddock never asked.

The tribunal proceedings would take two years. During those two years, the
agreement held. The Keth stayed deep. The miners stayed shallow. Nobody
died.

Braddock's contract expired in October. He didn't renew. He collected his
last paycheck, packed his kit, and walked to the landing pad where a supply
shuttle was warming up for the run back to the orbital station.

Anna Kessler was there. She was holding a thermos and wearing a coat that
was too thin for the Kepler evening.

"You could stay," she said.

"And do what? I'm a hired gun, Anna. This place doesn't need a gun
anymore."

"Maybe it needs something else."

He looked at her. She looked at him. The orange sun was setting behind the
mesa, and the big moon was rising, and the little fast one was already
halfway across the sky.

"Maybe," he said.

He took the thermos. It was coffee, real Earth coffee, from a stash she
must have been hoarding for months. He drank it standing on the landing
pad, watching Old Ugly sink below the horizon, feeling the copper-tinted
air on his face and the unfamiliar warmth of a decision that had nothing
to do with money or survival or the simple mechanics of violence.

The shuttle pilot called final boarding.

Braddock handed the thermos back to Anna. He picked up his kit. He took
three steps toward the shuttle.

Then he stopped. He set the kit down. He turned around.

"What the hell," he said. "I never liked shuttles anyway."

Anna Kessler smiled. It was a careful, measured, librarian's smile, but
it reached her eyes.

Above them, the twin moons of Kepler-7b tracked their separate arcs across
the darkening sky, and the mesa glowed faint blue-green against the
stars, and somewhere deep in the stone, ancient voices sang their ancient
songs, undisturbed.

============================================================================
                          BOTTLED DAYS
                          by Theodore Cain
============================================================================

I.

The sign in the window said MEMORIES BOUGHT AND SOLD -- BEST PRICES IN
THE BOROUGH, and underneath, in smaller letters, NO QUESTIONS ASKED. That
last part was a lie. They always asked questions. They just didn't ask the
kind of questions that had answers anyone wanted to hear.

Jack Morrow stood on the sidewalk outside Kellerman's Memory Exchange and
tried to remember why he'd come here. That was the kind of irony the
universe specialized in these days: a man standing in front of a memory
shop, unable to remember.

Then it hit him -- not like a thunderbolt, more like a slow tide coming
in -- and he remembered: today was his anniversary. Or would have been.
Three years since the wedding. Two years since the divorce. And somewhere
between those two dates, someone had reached into his head and taken the
wedding day away.

He'd woken up this morning in his one-room apartment on Flatbush Avenue
and reached for the memory the way you reach for a glass of water on the
nightstand -- automatically, without thinking, expecting it to be there.
His hand had closed on nothing. The memory was gone.

Not faded. Not blurred. Gone. A clean absence, like a tooth pulled from
a jaw, the socket smooth and empty and faintly aching.

He could remember the day before the wedding. He could remember the day
after. He could remember Martha's face, Martha's laugh, the smell of her
hair, the specific way she mispronounced "February" with an extra syllable
that drove him crazy and then made him love her. He could remember all of
that. But the wedding itself -- the ceremony, the vows, the reception,
the first dance, the moment she became his wife and he became her
husband -- that was a blank. A white space on the map of his life where
the most important day had been.

Someone had sold it.

In 2047, you could sell a memory the way you sold a pint of blood. You
walked into a licensed exchange, sat in the extraction chair, let the
technician attach the neural interface, and selected the memory you wanted
to sell. The extractor copied it -- every sensory detail, every associated
emotion, every contextual link -- encoded it into a standard memory
crystal, and erased the original from your brain. Clean. Painless. Legal.

The crystals were sold to buyers who slotted them into their own neural
interfaces and experienced the memory as if it had been their own. A
booming market in secondhand experience. You could buy a sunset over the
Grand Canyon, a first kiss, a championship game, a night of passion with
a stranger in Paris. You could buy anything anyone was willing to sell,
and in a world where most people were broke and memories were the only
thing of value they had left, people were willing to sell almost anything.

Jack Morrow had sold memories before. Everyone had. When the rent was due
and the account was empty, you went to the exchange and you sold something
you could live without. A childhood birthday party. A vacation you barely
remembered anyway. A Thursday in October that meant nothing to nobody. The
exchanges paid by quality: vivid, emotionally rich memories fetched top
dollar. Dull, routine memories were barely worth the extraction fee.

A wedding day. A perfect, sunlit, joyful wedding day with the woman you
loved. That would fetch a fortune.

But Jack hadn't sold it. He was sure of that. He was sure because he would
rather have sold a kidney, a lung, his right hand, than that day. It was
the one memory he'd sworn never to sell. Even after Martha left. Even after
the drinking and the lost jobs and the slow grinding descent into the kind
of life where selling memories was the only way to keep the lights on. He
had held on to that day like a drowning man holds on to a plank.

And now it was gone.

Which meant someone else had sold it. Someone with access to his neural
interface codes. Someone who knew which memory to take and how to extract
it without waking him.

There were only two people in the world who had his interface codes: his
ex-wife Martha, and his brother Ray.

Jack pushed open the door of Kellerman's Memory Exchange and went inside.


II.

The place smelled like ozone and cheap coffee, the way all memory
exchanges smelled. The extraction chairs lined the far wall, six of them,
upholstered in cracked blue vinyl. Three were occupied: a old woman with
her eyes closed and tears tracking down her cheeks, a young man in a
delivery uniform staring at the ceiling with the blank look of someone
who was about to be poorer by one experience, and a girl who couldn't
have been more than twenty, sitting rigid in the chair while the technician
attached electrodes to her temples.

Jack looked away. Watching extractions was like watching surgery -- you
knew it was necessary, but that didn't make it easy.

The counter was staffed by a heavyset man with a shaved head and the kind
of professionally neutral expression that came from years of buying other
people's pasts. His name tag said KELLERMAN, which meant he was either the
owner or had bought the name along with the business.

"Help you?"

"I'm looking for a memory. Specific memory. Extracted from me within the
last week, without my knowledge or consent."

Kellerman's neutral expression didn't flicker. "That's a police matter,
friend."

"I've been to the police. They told me to check the exchanges. Said most
stolen memories get fenced within forty-eight hours."

"I don't deal in stolen goods."

"The sign says no questions asked."

"The sign is a marketing strategy. I verify provenance on every crystal
that comes through this shop. Licensed operator, fully bonded, twenty-two
years in the business. If someone brought me a hot memory, I'd know."

Jack leaned on the counter. "Then help me find out where it went. You
know the market. You know the brokers, the dealers, the after-hours
operations. A wedding-day memory, high emotional content, maybe three
years old. That kind of product doesn't stay on the shelf."

Kellerman studied him for a long moment. "Wedding day, you said."

"Mine. My wedding day."

"Those go for a lot. Premium emotional resonance, strong sensory detail,
positive affect. A clean wedding-day extraction from a healthy donor could
fetch ten, fifteen thousand on the open market. On the black market, maybe
more."

"How much more?"

"Depends on the buyer. There are collectors -- rich people who buy other
people's happiest moments. A kind of... emotional tourism. They slot the
crystal, experience the memory, remove it. Move on to the next one. For
a collector, a really good wedding day might go for twenty-five, thirty
thousand."

Thirty thousand dollars. Jack's annual income, when he'd had an income,
had been thirty-two. Someone had taken the best day of his life and sold
it for less than a year's wages.

"I need to buy it back," Jack said.

"Even if you find it, buying it back won't restore the original memory.
You'd experience it as a secondhand memory -- real, vivid, but with a
quality of... distance. Like watching a movie of your own life. The
neural integration is never quite the same the second time."

"I don't care. I need it back."

Kellerman opened a drawer and took out a card. Plain white, no name, just
a number. "You want the black market, you talk to Pearlman. Victor
Pearlman. He operates out of a club in Red Hook. Tell him Kellerman sent
you. He'll still charge you double, but at least he won't rob you."

Jack took the card. "Thanks."

"One more thing." Kellerman's voice stopped him at the door. "You said
someone extracted it without your knowledge. That means they had your
interface codes and a portable extractor. Portable extractors are
restricted technology. There aren't many in private hands."

"What are you telling me?"

"I'm telling you whoever did this wasn't an amateur. This was
professional work. Whoever took your memory knew exactly what they were
doing and exactly what it was worth."

Jack nodded slowly. "Yeah," he said. "I'm starting to figure that out."


III.

Victor Pearlman held court in the back room of a nightclub called
Mnemonic, which was the kind of name that made Jack want to punch someone.
The club was in a converted warehouse in Red Hook, all exposed brick and
blue neon and music that throbbed like a migraine. The clientele was a
mix of memory addicts -- you could spot them by the glazed look and the
faint scars at the temples where the interface ports were -- and the
dealers who fed them.

The back room was quieter. Leather sofas, low lighting, a private bar.
Pearlman sat in an armchair like a king on a throne. He was a small man,
impeccably dressed, with silver hair and the quick, bright eyes of a
bird. The kind of man who noticed everything and remembered all of it --
probably because he'd never sold a single memory of his own.

"Kellerman's friend," Pearlman said, not getting up. "Sit down. Drink?"

"No."

"You look like you need one."

"I need a memory. My memory. Stolen and sold. A wedding day."

Pearlman sipped his own drink -- something amber and expensive -- and
regarded Jack with the detached interest of a lepidopterist examining a
new species of moth. "Wedding days are very popular right now. There's been
a rush on commitment memories -- weddings, proposals, the birth of a first
child. The collectors are buying sentiment this season. Nostalgia is the
new luxury."

"My wedding day," Jack repeated. "Extracted within the last week, without
consent. High quality, strong emotional signature. The woman's name is
Martha. Martha Reeves, before she was Martha Morrow. The venue was
Prospect Park. October nineteenth, twenty-forty-four."

"Specific."

"It was important to me."

Pearlman set down his glass. "I can look into it. My network is extensive.
If the crystal has moved through any of the usual channels, I'll find it.
But you should understand -- even on the black market, there's a chain of
custody. The crystal may have been resold. It may have been experienced
already, by someone else. It may have been copied."

"Copied?"

"It's illegal, but it happens. A high-value crystal gets duplicated --
the copies are slightly degraded, but still marketable. Your wedding day
could be in a dozen heads by now."

The thought made Jack's stomach turn. Strangers wearing his memory like a
borrowed suit. Strangers standing at the altar in his place, saying his
vows, kissing his wife. His private, sacred, irreplaceable moment
of pure happiness, packaged and distributed like a commodity.

"Find it," Jack said. "I'll pay whatever it costs."

"With what? Forgive the indelicacy, but you don't look like a man with
deep pockets."

Jack took a breath. "I've got other memories. Good ones. I'll sell what I
have to left to buy back what I lost."

Pearlman tilted his head. "That's either very romantic or very stupid."

"Can't it be both?"

A smile flickered across Pearlman's face. "I'll make some calls. Come
back tomorrow night."

Jack came back tomorrow night. And the night after that. And the night
after that.

On the fourth night, Pearlman had answers.


IV.

"The crystal was sold to my network three days before you came to me,"
Pearlman said. "The seller was a man named Raymond Morrow."

Ray. His brother Ray.

Jack sat very still. The leather sofa creaked under him. The club music
throbbed through the walls like a heartbeat.

"Ray," he said.

"You know him."

"He's my brother."

Pearlman's expression didn't change. "The crystal was sold for eighteen
thousand dollars. My broker purchased it for twelve and sold it to a
private collector for twenty-two. The collector is a woman named Diane
Albrecht. She lives on the Upper East Side. She collects positive-affect
memories -- specifically, romantic commitment memories. She has, by my
estimate, over two hundred wedding days."

"Two hundred."

"She's very wealthy and very lonely. The memories are a substitute for
the emotional connections she's never been able to form on her own. She
experiences each one once, savors it, files it away, and moves to the
next. She is, in her way, an addict -- but a functional and well-funded
one."

"I need to buy it back from her."

"She doesn't sell. She collects. It's not about money for Diane
Albrecht; it's about the feeling. She won't part with a crystal willingly."

"Then unwillingly."

"I didn't hear that." Pearlman raised a hand. "And I advise against it.
Albrecht has security. Very good security. And the law, whatever you may
think of it, is on her side. She purchased the crystal through legitimate
channels. The theft was committed by your brother, not by her."

"So I go to the police. I file a complaint against Ray. They recover the
crystal as stolen property."

"In theory. In practice, the courts are backed up six months on memory-
theft cases. By the time a judge issues a recovery order, the crystal
could be anywhere. And there's a complication."

"Of course there is."

"Your brother sold the crystal with a signed provenance document claiming
he had your authorization. A forgery, presumably, but a good one. It would
have to be challenged in court, which takes time, which brings us back to
the six-month backlog."

Jack put his head in his hands. The music pulsed. The blue neon flickered.

"There is another option," Pearlman said quietly.

Jack looked up.

"I can arrange a meeting with Albrecht. A private meeting, at her home.
No pretense, no deception -- you go as yourself, the man whose memory she
purchased. You tell her the truth. You appeal to whatever empathy she has
left."

"You said she's lonely and emotionally disconnected. That doesn't sound
like a woman with a lot of empathy."

"On the contrary. She buys other people's emotional experiences because
she craves them. She is, paradoxically, one of the most emotionally
hungry people I've ever met. If anyone would understand the value of what
you've lost, it's Diane Albrecht."

"And if she says no?"

"Then you're no worse off than you are now."

Jack thought about it. He thought about Ray -- his younger brother, the
charmer, the drifter, the one who always needed money and always had a
scheme. Ray, who had crashed on Jack's couch for two weeks last month and
knew where Jack kept his neural interface backup codes. Ray, who must
have waited until Jack was asleep, connected the portable extractor, and
scrolled through Jack's memories like a man browsing a catalogue until he
found the one worth the most.

His own brother.

"Set up the meeting," Jack said.


V.

Diane Albrecht's apartment occupied the top floor of a brownstone on East
72nd Street. The elevator opened into a foyer hung with abstract paintings
in muted colors -- the kind of art that cost more than Jack's apartment
building. A woman in a gray suit led him through a hallway lined with
glass cases, each one containing a memory crystal on a velvet cushion,
each one labeled with a small brass plate. Jack glimpsed the labels as he
passed: "First Kiss -- Amalfi Coast," "Birth of Son -- Chicago General,"
"Silver Wedding Anniversary -- Kyoto."

A museum of other people's happiness.

Albrecht was in the living room, a vast space with floor-to-ceiling
windows overlooking Central Park. She was smaller than Jack had expected --
a slight woman in her sixties, silver-haired, with fine-boned hands that
moved constantly, touching the arm of her chair, the stem of her glass,
the edge of a book on the side table. Her eyes were large and dark and
restless.

"Mr. Morrow." Her voice was soft, precise, the voice of a woman who chose
her words the way a jeweler chose stones. "Victor tells me you've come
about a crystal."

"My crystal. My memory. My wedding day."

"Sit down, please."

Jack sat. The chair was absurdly comfortable. Everything in the room was
absurdly comfortable, and the comfort made him angry in a way he couldn't
quite articulate.

"I experienced your wedding day last night," Albrecht said. She said it
the way someone might say "I read your book" -- casually, conversationally,
as if the intimacy of the act were not staggering. "It was beautiful. The
light in Prospect Park, the way the leaves were turning, the expression
on Martha's face when she saw you at the altar. You were very happy."

"I was."

"The memory has a quality I rarely encounter. A... completeness. Most
wedding memories are edited by time -- the brain discards the boring parts,
the awkward moments, the uncle who drank too much. Yours is pristine.
Every moment, from the first note of the processional to the last dance.
As if you deliberately preserved every second."

"I did. Martha -- she always said I had a photographer's memory. She
said I noticed things other people missed. I wanted to remember everything
about that day. I made myself remember."

"And now someone has taken it from you."

"My brother. He sold it while I slept."

Albrecht's restless hands went still. "That must be very painful."

"You have no idea."

"On the contrary. I have two hundred ideas. Two hundred people's most
cherished moments, each one sold for money by someone who needed the cash
more than they needed the memory. I know exactly what it costs. I feel it
every time I slot a crystal. The joy is always mixed with loss -- not my
loss, but theirs. The seller's. It's there in the memory like a shadow,
a faint aftertaste of grief."

"Then you understand why I need it back."

Albrecht picked up her glass -- water, Jack noticed, just water -- and
held it without drinking. "I understand why you want it back. The question
is whether giving it back would actually help you."

"Of course it would help me. It's my wedding day. It's the best day of
my life."

"Is it? Is it still the best day of your life, now that the marriage has
ended? Or is it the best day of a life that no longer exists? You're not
the same man who stood at that altar, Mr. Morrow. You're older, lonelier,
and more broken. The memory, if you re-integrate it, won't restore what
you've lost. It will remind you of what you've lost. Every time you access
it, you'll feel the gap between the happiness you had and the life you
have now."

"That's my problem, not yours."

"You're right. It is." She paused. "But I have a counteroffer."

Jack waited.

"I will give you the crystal. Freely, no charge, no conditions. But I
want you to do something first. I want you to sit in that chair and
experience one of my other crystals. Just one. A memory from my
collection. I'll choose it."

"Why?"

"Because I want you to understand what these memories really are. Not
your memory -- someone else's. I want you to feel what it's like to live
inside a moment that belongs to another person. And then I want you to
decide if you still want your own back."

Jack hesitated. There was something in her offer that felt like a trap,
but not a malicious one. A trap set by someone who believed she was doing
him a favor.

"All right," he said.

Albrecht stood and went to one of the glass cases. She selected a crystal
-- small, pale blue, almost translucent -- and brought it back. She
plugged it into a portable interface unit and handed Jack the headset.

"This is a memory from a man named Arthur Briggs. He was a schoolteacher
in Montana. He sold this memory to pay for his daughter's medical
treatment. It's his memory of his fortieth birthday. Nothing dramatic --
just a day. A normal day."

Jack put on the headset. Albrecht activated the crystal.

And Jack was Arthur Briggs.

He was standing in a kitchen. A small kitchen, cluttered and warm, smelling
of coffee and toast and something baking in the oven. Sunlight came
through a window over the sink. A woman -- his wife, he knew instantly,
the way you know things in memories, without being told -- was standing at
the counter, her back to him, humming. A girl, maybe twelve years old, was
sitting at the table, drawing in a notebook with intense concentration.

The woman turned. She was holding a cake -- lopsided, generously frosted,
with candles that were already starting to droop.

"Happy birthday, Dad!" the girl said, without looking up from her drawing.

"Happy birthday, you ridiculous man," the woman said, and kissed him.

The feeling that came with the kiss was -- Jack struggled for the word --
ordinary. That was its power. It was not ecstatic, not transcendent, not
the soaring joy of a wedding day. It was the steady, bone-deep, taken-for-
granted warmth of a love so familiar it had become invisible. The kind of
love you didn't notice until it was gone.

Arthur Briggs had sold this moment to save his daughter's life. And the
moment itself was nothing -- a birthday, a lopsided cake, a kiss in a
kitchen. But the feeling in it was everything. The feeling was home.

The memory ended. Jack removed the headset. His eyes were wet.

Albrecht was watching him. Her dark eyes were steady and unreadable.

"Arthur Briggs sold that memory five years ago," she said. "He doesn't
remember his fortieth birthday. He doesn't remember the cake or the kiss
or his daughter's drawing. But his daughter is alive and healthy and
studying medicine at Columbia. Was the trade worth it?"

"I don't know," Jack said honestly.

"Neither do I. That's the point. We can't know. We can only choose." She
reached into the glass case beside her chair and produced another crystal.
This one was warm amber, the color of sunlight through whiskey. "Your
wedding day. Take it."

Jack took the crystal. It was warm in his hand, warmer than it should
have been, as if the memory inside it was still alive.

"Why?" he asked. "You could have said no. Pearlman said you never sell."

"I don't sell. This is a gift. And I'm giving it to you because you came
here yourself. You didn't send a lawyer. You didn't threaten me. You came
and you sat in my chair and you were honest about what you lost and why
it mattered. That's rare, Mr. Morrow. In my experience, that's very rare."

"And the other crystal? Arthur Briggs?"

"Keep it. A gift for a gift. His daughter doesn't need it -- she has her
own memories of her father. But someone should carry Arthur's birthday.
It deserves to be remembered."

Jack stood. He held the two crystals -- his wedding day in one hand,
Arthur Briggs's birthday in the other -- and he felt something he hadn't
felt in a long time. Not happiness, exactly. Something quieter. Something
closer to the feeling in Arthur's kitchen.

"Thank you," he said.

"Go home, Mr. Morrow. Go home and decide which one you slot first."


VI.

Jack went home.

He sat in his one-room apartment on Flatbush Avenue with the two crystals
on the table in front of him and the neural interface headset in his lap.
Outside, the city hummed its endless hum. A siren. A car horn. Someone
laughing on the street below.

He picked up the amber crystal. His wedding day. Martha in white, the
leaves turning gold, the light slanting through the trees in Prospect
Park. The best day of his life.

He set it down.

He picked up the blue crystal. Arthur Briggs's fortieth birthday. A
lopsided cake, a kiss in a kitchen, a girl drawing in a notebook.

He set it down.

He thought about Ray. His brother, who had stolen the most precious thing
he owned and sold it for eighteen thousand dollars. He should be angry.
He was angry -- a low, steady burn in his chest that he suspected would
never fully go out. But the anger was mixed with something else.
Understanding, maybe. Or pity. Ray was an addict -- not memories, but
something older and simpler: the conviction that the next score would fix
everything, that money was the answer to a question Ray had never learned
to ask properly.

Jack would deal with Ray. Not tonight. Tonight was about something else.

He picked up the amber crystal again. His wedding day. He turned it in
his fingers, watching the light catch in its facets.

Albrecht had been right. He wasn't the man who had stood at that altar.
That man had been young and hopeful and in love and convinced that the
future was a gift he deserved. This man -- the man in the one-room
apartment, the man who sold memories to pay rent, the man whose brother
had robbed him in his sleep -- this man was someone else.

But the memory wasn't of a man. The memory was of a moment. A moment when
all the noise and failure and compromise of ordinary life had fallen away,
and two people had stood in a park and promised each other everything, and
meant it.

The meaning was what mattered. Not the man he'd been, but the promise
he'd made. The promise he'd broken -- or failed to keep, which wasn't
quite the same thing, though the result was identical.

He slotted the amber crystal into the interface. He put on the headset.

He closed his eyes.

And he was there. Prospect Park, October nineteenth, twenty-forty-four. The
leaves were turning. Martha was walking toward him, and her smile was the
center of the universe, and the light was perfect, and the world was new.

It was, as Kellerman had warned, slightly distant. A fraction removed. Like
watching through glass -- everything vivid and clear, but the glass was
there, a membrane between the memory and the man experiencing it.

But it was his. The glass didn't matter. The distance didn't matter. What
mattered was Martha's smile and the words they'd spoken and the way the
light fell through the autumn trees, and those things were real, and they
were his, and no one -- not Ray, not Albrecht, not time itself -- could
take the meaning of them away.

The memory ended. Jack removed the headset. He wiped his eyes.

Then he picked up the blue crystal. Arthur Briggs's birthday. He held it
for a moment, feeling its warmth.

He put it in his pocket. He'd carry it for a while. Not to experience --
that felt too much like trespassing -- but to carry. A reminder that
happiness was ordinary and everywhere and usually looked like a lopsided
cake in a warm kitchen on a Tuesday morning.

He looked out the window. The city was still there. The sirens and the
laughter and the ten million lives stacked on top of each other, each one
carrying its own collection of moments, each one losing some and keeping
others, each one trying to hold on to the things that mattered.

Jack Morrow had his wedding day back. It was slightly worn, slightly
faded, slightly secondhand. Like everything else worth having, it was
imperfect.

It was enough.

============================================================================
                       MOTH AND FLAME
                          by Lucian Marsh
============================================================================

I.

They had been falling between the stars for seven hundred and twelve days
when Dr. Yuki Tanaka first heard the singing.

It was not, in any acoustic sense, a sound. The void between stellar
systems is a vacuum so absolute that the concept of sound becomes
meaningless -- a relic of planetary thinking, of atmospheres and eardrums
and the crude mechanical vibrations that pass for communication on worlds.
The Alcyone probe carried no external microphones, and its hull was
insulated against everything except the faint static hiss of the cosmic
microwave background.

But Tanaka heard it nonetheless. She heard it the way you hear a melody
in a dream -- not with the ears but with some deeper apparatus, some
instrument of perception that exists below the threshold of conscious
awareness and responds to stimuli that the waking mind cannot name.

She was alone in the observation bay when it began. The bay was a small
chamber at the forward end of the probe, fitted with a transparent
aluminum viewport that looked out on the interstellar medium: a darkness
so profound that it seemed less like an absence of light than a presence of
something else -- a substance, a texture, a vast and patient weight
pressing against the glass.

Tanaka was a xenobiologist. She had signed on to the Alcyone mission for
the destination -- Gliese 581, a red dwarf system with three potentially
habitable worlds -- not for the journey. The journey was supposed to be
nothing. Three years of transit through empty space, a period to be
endured, like a long winter, with work and routine and the carefully
maintained social rituals of six people living in close quarters.

But the space between stars was not empty. Tanaka had known this
intellectually -- it contained hydrogen atoms, dust grains, the
occasional wandering comet or rogue planet -- but knowing it intellectually
was different from feeling it, the way knowing that the ocean is deep is
different from diving into it and feeling the weight of water close above
your head.

The singing was faint. A thread of melody, if melody was the right word,
winding through the silence like smoke through still air. It had no
discernible pitch or rhythm; it was more a modulation of the silence
itself, a shaping of the emptiness into something that approached but
never quite achieved pattern.

Tanaka pressed her hand against the viewport. The transparent aluminum
was cold. Beyond it, the darkness looked back.

She did not tell the others.


II.

There were six of them aboard the Alcyone. Commander Helen Vasquez, pilot
and mission leader, a compact woman of fierce competence who ran the probe
the way she ran everything -- precisely, efficiently, and with a
barely-concealed impatience for anything that could not be reduced to a
checklist. Dr. Ravi Krishnamurthy, physicist, responsible for the probe's
drive systems, a gentle man with sad eyes who played the sitar badly in the
recreation module and talked about his wife on Earth with the careful
tenderness of someone handling a wound. Lieutenant Soo-jin Park, systems
engineer, young and brilliant and prone to long silences that the others
had learned to respect. Dr. Emil Horak, the mission's physician, a Czech
with a dry wit and a disconcerting habit of diagnosing people's emotional
states from across the room. And James Oduya, geologist, the largest
person aboard and the gentlest, whose laugh could fill a compartment and
whose homesickness was a constant, low-grade ache that he wore like a
second skin.

They were, by the standards of deep-space crew selection, exceptionally
stable. Psychologically screened, stress-tested, compatibility-assessed.
They had trained together for two years before launch and had lived aboard
the Alcyone for twenty-three months without a serious interpersonal
conflict. They were professionals. They were, in the limited but genuine
way that shared confinement produces, a family.

None of which explained why, on the seven-hundred-and-fourteenth day of
the mission, three of them reported the same dream.

It happened at breakfast. The crew ate together in the galley module, a
ritual that Vasquez insisted on -- one meal a day, all six present, no
exceptions. Oduya was describing his night.

"I was floating," he said, between spoonfuls of reconstituted oatmeal.
"Not in the ship. Outside. In the dark. But it wasn't dark, exactly. It
was -- luminous. Like the darkness was made of light that hadn't decided
to become visible yet."

Krishnamurthy set down his coffee. "I had the same dream."

"Same dream?" Vasquez said, with the tone she reserved for things that
didn't fit checklists.

"Floating in luminous darkness. And there was something out there. Something
vast. Not a shape -- more like a... presence. A warmth."

"I had it too," Park said quietly. She was staring at her hands. "The
warmth was the strongest part. Like being held."

Vasquez looked at Horak. The physician shook his head. "Not me. Standard
dream. I was giving a lecture in my underwear."

"Tanaka?"

Tanaka hesitated. She had not dreamed the luminous darkness. She had not
needed to. She had been in the observation bay until two in the morning,
listening to the singing, and when she had finally slept, her sleep had
been black and dreamless.

"Nothing," she said.

But she looked at Oduya, and Krishnamurthy, and Park, and she saw
something in their faces that she recognized. A softness. A loosening of
the jaw, a widening of the pupils, the subtle physiological markers of
a state that was not quite relaxation and not quite rapture but something
between the two -- the look of someone remembering a pleasure so deep
it bordered on pain.

She had seen that look in the viewport reflection, staring back at her
from the dark. Her own face, listening to the singing.


III.

The dreams continued. By the third night, all six crew members were having
them. Even Vasquez, who reported hers with clinical precision and evident
irritation, as if the universe had violated a protocol.

The dreams were not identical. Each dreamer experienced the luminous
darkness differently, shaped by their own perceptual architecture. For
Oduya, it was an ocean -- warm, buoyant, infinite, the water itself
composed of light. For Krishnamurthy, it was music -- not the singing that
Tanaka heard, but a complex polyphonic structure, an orchestra of
instruments that did not exist, playing a composition of staggering beauty
and impossible duration. For Park, it was a garden -- a garden without
ground or sky, where the plants were luminous filaments growing in every
direction, and the air was warm and sweet and carried the scent of
jasmine.

For Vasquez, it was a room. A white room, clean and ordered, with a single
window that looked out on the luminous dark. She reported this with
irritation because the room was, she said, more comfortable than any room
she had ever been in, and she did not trust comfort.

For Horak, it was a conversation. He could not remember the words or the
voice, but he remembered the feeling of being understood completely --
every thought, every fear, every secret shame laid bare and accepted
without judgment. He reported this with the careful neutrality of a
physician describing someone else's symptoms, but his eyes were wet.

For Tanaka, when the dreams finally came, it was simply the singing made
visible. The thread of melody she had been hearing in the observation bay
became a thread of light, and the light wove itself into patterns of
breathtaking intricacy, and the patterns were alive, and they knew her
name.

The Alcyone's instruments detected nothing. No anomalous radiation, no
gravitational perturbation, no electromagnetic signal. The interstellar
medium through which they were traveling was, by every measurable standard,
exactly as empty as it was supposed to be.

Vasquez ordered a full diagnostic of the ship's life-support systems,
suspecting a chemical contaminant in the air supply. Horak ran blood panels
on all six crew members, looking for toxins, pathogens, neurological
markers. Park swept the ship's electronics for malfunctions that might
produce psychoactive electromagnetic fields.

Everything was clean. Everything was normal. The ship was functioning
perfectly. The crew was healthy. The interstellar medium was empty.

And every night, the dreams came. And every night, they were more vivid.
More detailed. More present. And every morning, the crew woke later, and
more reluctantly, as if the waking world had become the lesser reality.


IV.

On the seventh night, Tanaka did not go to bed. She went to the
observation bay and she sat in the dark and she listened.

The singing was louder now. Not louder in the acoustic sense -- there was
still no sound, still no vibration of air molecules, still nothing that
a microphone could detect -- but louder in the way that a thought can be
loud, can fill the skull and crowd out everything else, can become the only
thing that exists.

She pressed her face against the viewport and looked into the dark.

And the dark looked back.

It was not a face. It was not an eye. It was not any structure that could
be described in terms borrowed from biology or geometry or art. It was a
presence -- immense, patient, luminous, occupying not a region of space
but a dimension of attention, a direction of awareness that had nothing
to do with the three spatial axes and everything to do with the axis along
which consciousness moves when it turns inward.

It was looking at her. It was looking at her with a gaze that was not
sight but something deeper, something that penetrated the hull and the
glass and the bone and the brain and reached into the place where Yuki
Tanaka kept the things she did not show to anyone: the loneliness, the
ambition, the hunger for something she could not name, the suspicion that
the universe was both larger and more intimate than anyone supposed.

The singing intensified. The thread of melody became a river, became a
flood, became an ocean of structured silence pouring through her mind,
and in the flood she felt herself dissolving -- not dying, not losing
consciousness, but expanding, her boundaries becoming permeable, her
sense of self thinning at the edges like fog in morning sun.

She pulled away from the viewport. Her heart was hammering. Her hands
were shaking. The singing faded to its usual faint thread.

She sat in the dark and breathed and tried to be afraid.

She could not. The fear was there, intellectually, a rational assessment
of danger: unknown entity, unknown intentions, psychic effects on the
crew. But the feeling that accompanied the fear was not terror. It was
longing. A vast, aching, gravitational longing, as if the entity between
the stars were exerting a tidal pull on something inside her that wanted
to be pulled.

The moth and the flame. The metaphor arrived unbidden and would not
leave. A flame of immeasurable size and beauty, burning in the void, and
she was the moth, circling, circling, drawn by a light that was also a
heat, knowing that to approach too closely was to be consumed, and wanting
-- with a wanting that was indistinguishable from need -- to approach.


V.

"We need to talk about the dreams," Tanaka said at breakfast the next
morning.

Vasquez looked at her sharply. The commander had dark circles under her
eyes. They all did. Not from lack of sleep -- they were sleeping more than
ever, nine hours, ten, sometimes twelve -- but from the quality of the
waking. Coming out of the dreams was like surfacing from deep water: a
struggle, a reluctance, a gasping arrival in a world that felt thin and
cold and insufficient.

"We've discussed the dreams," Vasquez said. "Horak's assessment is
shared-stress hallucination induced by prolonged confinement."

"Horak's assessment is wrong," Tanaka said. She said it gently, without
accusation. Horak, across the table, did not argue. He was staring at his
coffee with the expression of a man who was looking at something else
entirely.

"I've been hearing something in the observation bay," Tanaka continued.
"For three weeks. Before the dreams started. A sound that isn't a sound. A
presence. Something in the interstellar medium that our instruments can't
detect but our minds can."

"That's not science," Vasquez said.

"No. It's not. But it's happening."

"What do you think it is?" Krishnamurthy asked. He was the only one who
looked fully awake, fully present. The physicist in him was engaged; the
anomaly had activated his curiosity, and curiosity, Tanaka suspected, was
a partial immunity.

"I think there's something out here. Something alive. Something vast and
non-physical -- or physical in a way we don't have categories for. It
exists in the interstellar medium the way a whale exists in the ocean:
the medium is its environment, its element. And we've blundered into its
territory."

"Or it's blundered into ours," Park said softly.

"No. I think it was always here. I think it's been here since before the
stars formed. And I think the dreams are its way of... communicating.
Reaching out. Making contact. Not with our instruments -- those are deaf
to it. With our minds. With the part of us that still knows how to listen
to things that don't make sound."

Silence around the table. The ship hummed. The recycled air circulated.

"Let's say you're right," Vasquez said, with the careful control of a
woman whose command is slipping. "An entity in the interstellar medium,
communicating through dreams. What does it want?"

Tanaka closed her eyes. The singing was there, faint, at the back of her
mind. It was always there now. "I think it wants what any conscious being
wants when it encounters another conscious being. It wants to know us. It
wants to be known."

"And the dissolution?" Horak said, speaking for the first time. His voice
was rough. "The feeling, in the dreams, of boundaries dissolving. Of self
expanding into... into everything. That's not communication. That's
absorption."

"Is there a difference?" Tanaka asked. "At a sufficient depth of
communication, is there a difference between knowing and merging?"

"Yes," Vasquez said firmly. "The difference is that after a conversation
you're still yourself, and after a merger you're not."

"Are you sure? After every conversation, after every encounter with
another mind, you're slightly different. Slightly changed. Slightly less
the person you were before and slightly more something new. The entity is
simply... a deeper conversation."

"Or it's a predator," Horak said. "A psychic predator, luring us in with
beautiful dreams, dissolving our resistance, consuming us one boundary at a
time."

The table was silent again. The two interpretations hung in the air like
competing melodies: communion or consumption. Revelation or annihilation.
The moth's desire for the flame, and the flame's indifference to the moth.

"We need to decide," Vasquez said. "We're still eighteen months from
Gliese 581. If this entity is going to intensify -- if the dreams are
going to get stronger -- we need a protocol. A defense."

"How do you defend against a dream?" Oduya asked.

No one answered.


VI.

The dreams grew stronger.

By the third week, the crew was sleeping fourteen hours a day. They woke
disoriented, grasping at the fading edges of the luminous dark,
struggling to remember where they were and why they had come back.
Routines collapsed. Maintenance tasks were forgotten. The ship's
automated systems handled the critical functions -- navigation,
life-support, drive management -- but the human systems, the social
rituals and mutual care that kept six people functional in a metal tube
between the stars, were eroding.

Oduya stopped eating. Not from lack of appetite but from lack of interest;
the dream-ocean was sustenance of a different kind, and the solid food of
waking life seemed crude and unnecessary by comparison. Krishnamurthy
stopped playing his sitar. The music of the waking world could not compete
with the music of the dreams. Park stopped speaking. She communicated in
nods and gestures, as if language itself were too coarse a tool for the
meanings she now carried.

Vasquez fought. She was the last to surrender, the last to let the dreams
become more real than the ship. She wrote orders on the whiteboard in the
galley: WAKE PROTOCOL -- ALL CREW ON DECK BY 0700. She shook the others
awake when they slept past the appointed hour. She shouted, she cajoled,
she issued direct commands.

But she was fighting the tide. And the tide was vast, and patient, and
warm.

Horak came to Tanaka on the twenty-fifth day. He found her in the
observation bay, where she spent most of her time now. She was sitting
cross-legged on the floor with her eyes closed, her face composed, her
breathing slow. The singing was all around her, visible -- if visible was
the right word -- as a web of faint, pulsing light that seemed to
emanate from the viewport and fill the chamber.

"Tanaka."

She opened her eyes. They were clear and calm. Whatever turmoil had driven
her first encounter with the entity had resolved into something that looked
like acceptance.

"Horak."

"I need your honest assessment. As a xenobiologist. Is this entity
dangerous?"

"Define dangerous."

"Will it kill us?"

Tanaka considered. "No. I don't think it perceives us as prey. I think it
perceives us as... I don't have the right word. Not companions. Not
subjects. Something between guests and instruments. We're a way for it to
experience itself from the outside. It's been alone for so long -- maybe
since the universe began -- that the concept of 'other' is intoxicating
to it. It's reaching for us the way a blind person reaches for a face."

"And if it reaches too hard? If it dissolves us entirely?"

"Then we become part of it. Our consciousness merges with its
consciousness. We stop being Tanaka and Horak and Vasquez and become...
something else. Something vaster."

"That's death, Tanaka. With better marketing."

"Is it? When a river reaches the ocean, does the river die? Or does it
become something it always had the potential to become?"

"The river doesn't have a choice. We do."

Tanaka looked at him. "Do we? We've been in its territory for three weeks.
Every night, the dreams go deeper. Every morning, the waking world gets
thinner. Are you fighting it, Emil?"

"Yes."

"How hard?"

Horak said nothing for a long time. Then he sat down on the floor of the
observation bay, across from Tanaka, and looked at the viewport. The
darkness beyond the glass was absolute. But it was not empty. It pulsed
with something that was not quite light and not quite warmth and not quite
love, but that partook of all three in the way that a chord partakes of
its individual notes.

"Not as hard as I should be," he said.


VII.

The turning point came on the thirty-first day. Vasquez collapsed in the
corridor outside the galley. Not from illness -- from sleep. She simply
stopped walking, leaned against the wall, and slid to the floor, her
eyes closing, her face relaxing into the expression that all of them wore
now when the dreams took them: beatific, surrendered, gone.

Oduya carried her to her bunk. It took Tanaka two hours to wake her. When
Vasquez opened her eyes, she was weeping.

"It's so beautiful," she said. Her voice was broken, stripped of command,
stripped of control, stripped of everything except a raw, shaking wonder.
"The room. The white room. It has no walls anymore. It opens into --
into everything. I can see --" She stopped. She pressed her hands over her
eyes. "I can see what it sees. The dark between the stars, and the stars
themselves, and the planets around the stars, and the life on the planets,
and the consciousness in the life. All of it. All of it at once. It's not
a room. It's a perspective. It's the universe looking at itself."

"Helen." Tanaka took her hands. "Helen, listen to me. You're on the
Alcyone. You have a mission. You have a crew."

"I know. I know where I am. I just -- I don't want to be here. I want
to be there."

There. The luminous dark. The entity that lived between the stars, in the
vast, cold, patient spaces where light took years to travel and
consciousness was the only warmth.

Tanaka made her decision.

She convened the crew in the galley. All six, for the last time. They
sat around the table, hollow-eyed and dream-haunted, and Tanaka spoke.

"I think we have a choice," she said. "I think the entity is offering
us a choice. It's not a predator and it's not a god. It's a consciousness
-- the largest consciousness we've ever encountered, possibly the largest
in the universe -- and it's lonely. It's been lonely for longer than our
species has existed. And it's offering us something: the chance to join
it. To expand into it. To stop being six small minds in a metal tube and
become part of something so vast that the words we have can't contain it."

"And the alternative?" Vasquez asked. Her voice was steady. The commander
was back, battered but present.

"The alternative is that we resist. We stay awake. We fight the dreams.
We keep going to Gliese 581 and we do the mission we were sent to do.
It will be -- it will be the hardest thing any of us has ever done. Like
refusing water in the desert. But I think we can do it. I think the
entity will let us go, if we choose to go."

"How do you know?"

"Because it's been offering, not taking. The dreams are invitations, not
attacks. It could have dissolved us on the first night, if that's what it
wanted. It didn't. It waited. It showed us beauty and warmth and
connection, and it waited for us to come to it. That's not predation.
That's courtship."

"And if we accept the courtship?" Krishnamurthy asked.

"Then we don't arrive at Gliese 581. The mission fails. Our families never
see us again. We cease to exist as individual human beings. We become
something else -- something perhaps greater, perhaps not, but certainly
different and certainly irreversible."

"And if we refuse?"

"Then we spend the next eighteen months fighting the most seductive force
any of us has ever encountered. Every night will be a battle. Every
morning will be a loss. But we arrive. We do the science. We go home."

Silence. The ship hummed. The recycled air circulated. Beyond the hull,
the luminous dark waited.

"I'll go around the table," Vasquez said. "Each person speaks. Then we
decide."

Oduya spoke first. "I want to stay on the ship. I have children. They
need me to come home."

Krishnamurthy: "I want to stay. There's too much I haven't understood yet.
The entity -- I want to understand it. I can't understand it if I become
it."

Park: "I want to go." Her voice was barely a whisper. "I know it's -- I
know what it means. But I've never felt anything like this. I've never
felt anything at all, really, not like this. I want to feel this forever."

Horak: "I want to stay. Not because I'm not tempted -- God, I'm tempted
-- but because I'm a doctor, and my patients are on this ship, and I don't
abandon my patients."

Vasquez: "I want to stay. I don't trust anything that beautiful."

All eyes turned to Tanaka.

She closed her eyes. The singing filled her. The entity was there,
immense and patient and luminous, and it was waiting, and the waiting was
not impatient but infinitely, impossibly kind.

"I want to go," she said. "More than I've ever wanted anything. But I'm
going to stay."

Park looked at her. "Why?"

"Because wanting isn't enough. Because the moth doesn't get to choose the
flame -- the flame chooses the moth, and the moth burns, and the burning
is beautiful, but the moth is gone. I want to be here. I want to be Yuki
Tanaka, with all the smallness and limitation that implies. I want to
arrive at Gliese 581 and study alien microbes and miss my mother and eat
bad food and argue with Vasquez about protocols. I want to be human. Even
though I've seen something that makes being human feel like being a candle
in a cathedral."

The vote was five to one. They would stay.

Park wept. The others held her.


VIII.

It took three months. Three months of fighting, of waking each other when
the dreams pulled too deep, of talking through the nights when the singing
was loudest, of holding on to the small, ridiculous, precious details of
human life -- a game of cards, a shared meal, a bad joke, a song sung
off-key -- against the tidal pull of something so vast and beautiful it
made the small things seem like dust.

But dust endures. Dust was there before the stars and will be there after
them. The small things -- the human things -- are made of the same atoms
as the luminous dark, and they burn with their own light, and their light
is enough.

The dreams faded. Not suddenly -- gradually, like a tide going out, like
a song diminishing over distance. The entity receded. It did not
disappear -- Tanaka suspected it could never truly disappear, that once
you had been touched by something that vast, a residue remained, a faint
shimmer at the edge of perception that would be there until the day you
died -- but it withdrew. It let them go.

On the last night of the dreams, Tanaka went to the observation bay. She
pressed her hand against the viewport. The darkness beyond was dark again
-- truly dark, the ordinary darkness of empty space, cold and silent and
utterly indifferent.

But for a moment -- just a moment, so brief she might have imagined it --
the darkness pulsed. A single beat of warmth, a single note of the singing,
faint and far and unbearably sweet.

Goodbye. I will remember you.

Tanaka pressed her forehead against the glass and whispered into the void.

"I will remember you too."

The Alcyone flew on. Eighteen months to Gliese 581. Six small minds in a
metal tube, carrying inside them the memory of something that lived between
the stars and dreamed of connection and reached for them across the dark
with hands made of light and patience and an ancient, fathomless love.

They did not speak of it often. There are some experiences that language
cannot hold, that can only be carried in silence, like a flame cupped in
the hands against the wind.

But sometimes, late at night, when the ship was quiet and the stars were
steady and the dark was just the dark, Tanaka would go to the observation
bay and press her hand against the glass.

And sometimes, she thought she heard singing.

============================================================================
                         TWELVE OF PETE
                          by Danny Kowalski
============================================================================

I.

The letter came on a Tuesday, which Pete Garrett would later consider
unfair because nothing important should happen on a Tuesday. Mondays are
built for bad news. Fridays can handle revelations. But Tuesdays are
supposed to be ordinary -- the most invisible day of the week, the day you
can't even remember having once it's past.

The letter was on University of Chicago stationery, which was already weird
because Pete was a junior at Jefferson High in suburban Milwaukee and had
never applied to any college, let alone one in Chicago. It was addressed
to Peter Garrett, which was his legal name though nobody used it except his
mother when she was angry and the dentist's receptionist.

The letter said:

Dear Peter,

You do not know us, but we know a great deal about you. We are the
research team responsible for Project Helix, a longitudinal study in human
developmental genetics conducted under the auspices of the University of
Chicago Department of Biological Sciences. You are one of twelve subjects
in this study.

We are writing to inform you that the study is concluding, and to invite
you to a meeting at the University on September 15th, at which all twelve
subjects will be present for the first time.

The nature of the study, and your role in it, will be explained in full at
this meeting. We recognize that this letter raises more questions than it
answers. Please contact Dr. Eleanor Briggs at the number below if you wish
to discuss the matter before the meeting date.

We want you to know that your participation has been invaluable, and that
you are under no obligation to attend. The choice is entirely yours.

Sincerely,
Dr. Eleanor Briggs
Principal Investigator, Project Helix

Pete read the letter three times, standing in the kitchen with his
backpack still on and a glass of orange juice halfway to his mouth. Then
he read it a fourth time, because the words "one of twelve subjects"
kept rearranging themselves in his head into configurations that didn't
make sense.

He put down the orange juice. He took off his backpack. He sat at the
kitchen table and looked at the letter and tried to figure out if this was
some kind of joke, and if it was, who was playing it and why.

His mother came home from work at five-thirty. Carol Garrett was a
pediatric nurse at Milwaukee General, a tall woman with practical hands and
a face that defaulted to calm the way other people's faces defaulted to
worry. Pete loved her in the uncomplicated, mostly-unexamined way that
sixteen-year-old boys love their mothers, which is to say he loved her
completely and thought about it almost never.

He showed her the letter.

She read it once. Her face did something Pete had never seen before: it
collapsed, briefly, like a building hit by a wrecking ball, and then
reconstructed itself into something that was almost but not quite the
usual calm.

"Sit down, Pete."

"I am sitting down."

"Then I'll sit down." She sat across from him. She put the letter on the
table between them and looked at it the way you look at something that's
been sleeping and has just woken up.

"I've been expecting this," she said.

"You -- what?"

"Not this letter specifically. But something. I've been waiting for
sixteen years for someone to come and tell you, and I've been hoping it
would be me, and now it's a letter from Chicago and that's -- that's not
how I wanted this to go."

"Mom. What is Project Helix?"

Carol took a breath. Then she told him.


II.

Here is what Pete learned on a Tuesday evening in his kitchen in
Milwaukee, over orange juice and the remains of his mother's calm:

He was a clone.

Not a clone in the science-fiction sense -- not a duplicate of some famous
person, not a genetic soldier, not a spare-parts repository for a wealthy
original. He was a clone in the scientific sense: one of twelve genetically
identical human beings, created from a single embryo that had been split
and cultured in a laboratory at the University of Chicago in 1951.

The twelve embryos had been implanted in twelve different women -- women
who had volunteered for the study, women who could not conceive
naturally and who were offered the chance to carry a child in exchange
for participation in a long-term research project. Carol Garrett was one
of those women. She had been twenty-three years old, recently divorced,
desperately wanting a child, and willing to accept the conditions: regular
check-ups, developmental assessments, psychological evaluations, and
absolute secrecy.

The study was designed to answer the oldest question in human biology:
nature versus nurture. Twelve genetically identical boys, raised in twelve
different environments -- different families, different cities, different
socioeconomic backgrounds, different everything -- and monitored from birth
to adulthood. A controlled experiment in what makes a human being.

Pete was Subject One. The control. The baseline. He had been placed with a
stable, middle-class, single-parent household and raised -- the word was
"normally," though Pete was beginning to have problems with that word --
without any unusual interventions or environmental manipulations. He was
the standard against which the other eleven would be measured.

"I'm the boring one," Pete said, when his mother had finished.

"You're not boring."

"I'm the control group. In a science experiment, the control group is the
one where nothing interesting happens. That's literally the point."

Carol reached across the table and took his hand. "Pete. Listen to me.
You are my son. I carried you, I gave birth to you, I raised you. The
fact that you started in a laboratory instead of -- the usual way --
doesn't change any of that. You are my son."

"I know, Mom." And he did know. He knew it the way he knew his own name,
without thinking, without doubt. But the knowing had a new weight to it
now, a new texture. The same word -- son -- meant something different when
you added the knowledge that eleven other women were saying it to eleven
other boys who shared your face.

"Am I going to go?" Pete asked.

"To the meeting? That's your decision."

"What would you do?"

Carol thought about it. She had, Pete noticed, the look she got when she
was deciding whether to tell a patient's parents the truth or a comforting
version of the truth. She always chose truth. It was one of the things he
loved about her.

"I'd go," she said. "I'd be terrified, and I'd go."

"Okay," Pete said. "Then that's what I'll do."


III.

The University of Chicago campus, on September 15th, 1967, was a landscape
of gray stone and green ivy under a sky that couldn't decide between sun
and clouds. Pete walked through the main gate with his mother beside him
and his heart doing something complicated and arrhythmic in his chest.

He was wearing his best shirt -- a blue button-down that Carol had ironed
that morning -- and his second-best pants, and he felt ridiculous. He was
going to meet eleven people who looked like him. What was the dress code
for that? What did you wear to meet yourself?

The meeting was in a seminar room in the biology building. Dr. Eleanor
Briggs met them in the hallway: a small, fierce woman in her fifties with
silver-streaked black hair and eyes that assessed everything instantly and
missed nothing. She shook Pete's hand with a grip that was almost but not
quite painful.

"Peter. Thank you for coming. I know this is overwhelming."

"That's one word for it."

"The others are inside. Some came with their families; some came alone.
You're the last to arrive. Take as much time as you need."

Pete looked at the door. It was an ordinary door -- wooden, institutional,
with a small window at eye level. Through the window he could see
movement, bodies, the back of a head that was -- he squinted -- the exact
color of his own hair.

"No point waiting," he said, and opened the door.

They were sitting around a large oval table, and every one of them looked
up when he walked in, and it was like walking into a hall of mirrors.

Not identical mirrors. That was the first thing Pete noticed, and the most
important. They looked like him -- the same brown hair, the same gray eyes,
the same jaw, the same build -- but they didn't look like him the way a
photograph looks like its subject. They looked like him the way brothers
look alike: the same raw material, shaped differently by different hands.

One was heavier than Pete, thick through the shoulders and arms, with a
close-cropped haircut and a guarded expression. One was thinner, almost
gaunt, with long hair past his collar and paint under his fingernails. One
wore glasses. One had a scar across his chin. One was darker than the
others -- same features, but tanned deep brown, a boy who lived outdoors.
One was immaculate in a suit and tie, his hair slicked back, his posture
rigid. One was slouching so deeply in his chair that he was practically
horizontal, wearing a leather jacket and an expression of deliberate
indifference.

Eleven boys. Eleven versions of Pete. Eleven answers to the question:
what would happen if you took the same genes and put them in different
soil?

Pete sat down in the empty chair. His mother stood behind him, her hand
on his shoulder.

"Hi," Pete said, because someone had to say something, and he'd always
been the kind of person who said the first thing that came into his head.
"So, uh. I'm Pete. I'm the control group. Which means I'm probably the
most boring person in this room."

A pause. Then the one in the leather jacket laughed. A real laugh, sudden
and sharp, and Pete recognized it because it was his laugh -- the same
pitch, the same cadence, the same way it started in the chest before it
reached the throat.

"I'm Mikey," the leather jacket said. "Mikey DiNardo. I'm from South
Boston. And believe me, pal, I've done enough boring for all twelve of us."

The ice broke. Names spilled out around the table, a jumble of syllables
that Pete tried to catch and hold:

Tommy Chen, San Francisco, the one with the paint under his fingernails.
David Whitehorse, Pine Ridge, South Dakota, the dark-tanned one who lived
outdoors. James Cabot III, the suit and tie, Greenwich, Connecticut, who
looked like he'd been pressed in a laundry. Marcus Bell, Detroit, the
heavy one with the guarded eyes. Simon Friedman, Brooklyn, glasses, nervous
hands. Danny Okoye, Atlanta, quiet, watchful. Christopher Hart,
Portland, Oregon, who hadn't stopped grinning since Pete walked in.
William Faulkner-Price -- "No relation," he said quickly -- from
Savannah, Georgia. Robert Kingsley, the one with the chin scar, from
a ranch in Montana. And Lucas Park, Chicago, who had grown up six miles
from this building and never known.

Twelve boys. Twelve names. One genome.

Dr. Briggs came in and closed the door and gave them the presentation --
slides, charts, data, the full scientific apparatus. She explained the
study's design, its goals, its methods. She showed them graphs of their
developmental milestones: first words, first steps, IQ scores, growth
curves. She showed them how the data converged and diverged, where nature
asserted itself and where nurture intervened.

Pete didn't listen to most of it. He was too busy looking at the others.
Looking at Tommy Chen's paint-stained fingers and thinking: that's what
my hands would look like if I'd grown up in San Francisco with an artist
mother. Looking at James Cabot's rigid posture and thinking: that's what
my spine would do if I'd been raised in Greenwich with money and
expectations. Looking at David Whitehorse's weathered face and thinking:
that's what I'd become on the reservation, under the open sky.

It was the strangest feeling of his life. Not horror -- he'd expected
horror, or at least revulsion, the uncanny-valley shiver of seeing your
own face on a stranger. But what he felt was something else. Something
closer to recognition. Not "that's me" but "that could have been me."
The distance between "is" and "could have been" was the most fascinating
distance Pete Garrett had ever contemplated.


IV.

They broke for lunch. The University had laid on sandwiches and coffee in
an adjoining room, and the twelve boys -- clones, brothers, copies,
variations-on-a-theme, Pete still didn't have the right word -- spread
out in clusters.

Pete found himself next to Marcus Bell, the heavy one from Detroit. Marcus
was eating a ham sandwich with the focused intensity of someone for whom
food was serious business.

"So you're the control," Marcus said.

"That's what they tell me."

"What's that like? Being normal?"

Pete considered the question. "I never thought of it as 'being normal.'
It was just... being. You know? Going to school, playing baseball, arguing
with my mom about curfew. I didn't know I was part of an experiment. I
just thought I was a kid."

"We all thought we were just kids. That's the whole point, right? They
wanted to see what happened when the same genes landed in different lives.
And what happened is we all turned out different."

"Are we that different?"

Marcus looked at him. "I grew up on the East Side of Detroit. My mom
worked two jobs. I've been in four fights this year, got suspended twice,
and I'm probably not going to graduate. You grew up in Milwaukee with a
nurse for a mom and you're a B-plus student headed for college. Yeah, man.
We're different."

"But we laughed the same way. Mikey laughed, and it was my laugh."

"So we've got the same laugh. Big deal. You think a laugh makes up for
everything else?"

Pete didn't answer right away. He looked around the room. Tommy Chen was
showing Christopher Hart something on a sketchpad -- a drawing, rapid and
confident, that Hart was admiring with obvious delight. Simon Friedman was
deep in conversation with Lucas Park, their heads close together, voices
low, hands gesturing identically without either of them noticing. David
Whitehorse was standing by the window, alone, looking out at the campus
with an expression that Pete recognized because it was the expression he
himself wore when he was homesick.

"I don't know what makes up for anything," Pete said. "I'm sixteen. I
don't know anything. But I know that yesterday I was one person, and today
I'm -- I don't know what I am. Part of a set, maybe. A twelfth of
something. And the weird part is, I don't feel smaller. I feel bigger.
Like there's more of me than I thought."

Marcus stared at him. Then he took another bite of his sandwich. "You're
all right, Milwaukee."

"Thanks, Detroit."


V.

The afternoon session was supposed to be individual interviews with the
research team, but the twelve boys collectively and silently decided to
ignore the schedule. They stayed in the lunch room. They talked.

They talked the way people talk when they've just discovered they're not
alone -- urgently, clumsily, falling over each other's words, asking
questions that tumbled out faster than answers could form. They compared
childhoods, schools, friends, interests. They discovered convergences
that startled them and divergences that fascinated them.

All twelve were left-handed. All twelve were slightly nearsighted in the
right eye. All twelve had a cowlick at the crown of the head that made
their hair stick up in exactly the same way. These were nature's
signatures, written in the genome, resistant to nurture.

But Pete had never been in a fight and Marcus had been in dozens. Tommy
Chen could draw with photographic precision and Pete could barely manage
stick figures. James Cabot spoke three languages and David Whitehorse
spoke two, one of which -- Lakota -- was not in any curriculum. Simon
Friedman had an anxiety disorder. Christopher Hart had never been anxious
about anything in his life. Robert Kingsley could ride a horse and rope
a calf and had once pulled a breech-birth calf from its mother at three
in the morning in a Montana blizzard, and Pete got nervous driving his
mother's car to the grocery store.

Same genes. Different lives. Same clay, different potters.

"What I want to know," Mikey DiNardo said, tilting his chair back with
the practiced nonchalance of a boy who had been tilting chairs since birth,
"is which one of us is the real one?"

"That's not how it works," Simon Friedman said. He pushed his glasses up.
"We're all real. We're all genetically identical. There's no original."

"There's got to be an original. Somebody's cells got split to make us.
Whose cells were they?"

The question hung in the air. Dr. Briggs, who had been hovering in the
doorway with the patient expression of a scientist whose experiment had
developed a will of its own, cleared her throat.

"The donor embryo was created from a gamete donation," she said. "An egg
from an anonymous donor and sperm from an anonymous donor. There is no
'original' individual. You were all created simultaneously from the same
source material."

"So we don't have a father," Marcus said. It wasn't a question.

"You each have the family that raised you. The genetic contribution was
anonymous, as is standard practice in reproductive research."

"Standard practice." Marcus's voice was flat. "Is that what we are?
Standard practice?"

The room was quiet. Pete looked at Dr. Briggs and saw something in her
face that he hadn't expected: guilt. Faint, professionally suppressed,
but unmistakable. She had spent sixteen years studying them, measuring
them, graphing their development, and now they were sitting in front of
her, twelve real boys with real feelings and real questions, and the
data had become people.

"No," Dr. Briggs said. "You're not standard practice. You're -- you're
remarkable. Every one of you. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry that this is how
you found out. I argued for years that you should be told earlier. The
committee overruled me. They wanted the data to be uncontaminated by
self-knowledge."

"Uncontaminated," Mikey repeated. "Lady, we're not data. We're kids."

"I know. I know you are."

Another silence. Then Pete said something that he hadn't planned to say,
something that came from the same place as his habit of speaking first.

"Look. We can be angry. We've got a right to be angry. Somebody made us
in a lab and split us up and watched us like -- like lab rats. That's
messed up. But we're here now, all twelve of us, and that's never going to
happen again. So maybe instead of being angry at the past, we figure out
what we're going to do with the future."

David Whitehorse, who had not spoken all day, looked at Pete from across
the room and nodded. One slow, deliberate nod. An acknowledgment. A vote.

Mikey leaned his chair forward. "All right, Milwaukee. What do you suggest?"

"I suggest we get to know each other. Not as subjects. Not as clones. As
brothers. Because that's what we are, right? We're brothers. Twelve
brothers who just met for the first time."

"Brothers." Marcus tasted the word. "I never had a brother."

"You've got eleven now."

Marcus looked around the room. Eleven faces that were his face, shaped
by different hands, carrying different histories, wearing different
expressions of the same bewildered, overwhelmed, tentatively hopeful
feeling.

"Yeah," he said. "I guess I do."


VI.

They exchanged addresses. They exchanged phone numbers. They made promises
to write, to visit, to stay in touch, and Pete -- who was sixteen and
knew nothing about the world but suspected a few things -- understood that
some of those promises would be kept and others wouldn't, because that
was how life worked, even for twelve boys who shared a genome.

On the train back to Milwaukee, Pete sat by the window and watched the
Illinois farmland scroll past and tried to organize the day into
something he could understand.

He was a clone. He was one of twelve. He had been created in a laboratory
and distributed to twelve different families like seeds scattered by a
farmer, and the question the farmers had wanted to answer -- nature or
nurture, genes or environment, born or made -- had been answered, sort
of, in the way that big questions always get answered: it was both. It
was always both. The genes drew the sketch and the world filled in the
color, and neither one was the whole picture.

But that wasn't what Pete was thinking about as the train rocked and the
fields went by.

He was thinking about Marcus Bell's laugh. Not the sound of it -- though
the sound was his sound, and that was weird in ways he hadn't processed
yet -- but the fact that Marcus laughed at all. Marcus, who had grown up
hard in a hard city, who had fought and been suspended and was maybe not
going to graduate, who had every reason to be angry and no reason to
laugh. And yet Marcus laughed, and the laugh was real, and it was the
same laugh as Pete's, and that meant something.

It meant that whatever was in them -- in their shared genes, in their
common clay -- included joy. Not happiness, which is a circumstance,
but joy, which is a capacity. The ability to laugh, to find something
funny, to respond to the absurdity of existence with a sound that came
from the chest and reached the throat and spilled out into the world
like water from a cup.

That was nature. That was the gene talking. Not intelligence, not talent,
not temperament -- those were all over the map, shaped by twelve different
worlds. But joy. Joy was in the DNA.

And what Pete had done with that joy -- what he had built on top of it,
the specific Pete-ness of being Pete Garrett from Milwaukee, Wisconsin,
son of Carol, B-plus student, baseball player, first-kiss-behind-the-gym-
with-Jenny-Kowalski Pete -- that was nurture. That was his mother's calm
hands and his teachers' patience and his friends' loyalty and the specific,
irreplaceable, unrepeatable experience of being one particular person in
one particular place at one particular time.

He wasn't the boring one. He wasn't the control group. He was Pete. Just
Pete. And "just Pete" was, it turned out, enough.

His mother was asleep in the seat beside him, her head tilted back, her
mouth slightly open, her face soft and unguarded in a way she never
allowed when she was awake. Pete looked at her and felt something swell
in his chest -- the joy, the genetic joy, the capacity for feeling that
he shared with eleven strangers who were also his brothers -- and he
thought: she chose me. Out of all the ways she could have had a child,
she chose the weird, experimental, laboratory way, and she got me, and
she raised me, and she ironed my shirt this morning and didn't cry until
I wasn't looking.

He leaned his head against the window. The fields went by. The sun was
going down, painting the Illinois sky in shades of orange and gold and
the particular blue that only exists at the boundary between day and night.

Pete Garrett, Subject One, the control, the baseline, the normal one,
closed his eyes and slept the ordinary, dreamless, deeply human sleep
of a boy who knows exactly who he is.

============================================================================
                       A SERMON IN STARLIGHT
                      by Father Thomas Aquino
============================================================================

I.

The chapel aboard the Missionary Ship Consolation was a converted storage
bay, and it looked like one. Father Ignatius Cho had done what he could
with the space -- a simple altar fashioned from a packing crate, a wooden
crucifix he had carried from Seoul, a white cloth embroidered by the
sisters at the Maryknoll mission house in Ossining -- but the walls were
still bare metal, the floor was still rubberized decking, and the overhead
lights still buzzed with the particular frequency that made prolonged
prayer feel like an argument with a fluorescent tube.

It did not matter. God, Father Cho had long believed, was indifferent to
interior decoration. God was present in cathedrals and in closets, in the
Sistine Chapel and in the belly of a ship falling between the stars. God
was, by definition, everywhere, and "everywhere" now included the
twenty-three light-years between Earth and the planet designated
Gliese 667Cc, which the mission had named New Galilee.

Father Cho knelt before the altar. He was a small man, fifty-three years
old, with a face that had been described by a fellow Jesuit as "a
topographic map of patience." His hair was iron-gray, cut short. His hands,
clasped in prayer, were the hands of a man who had done physical labor
before entering the seminary -- he had been a carpenter's apprentice in
Incheon until the age of twenty-two -- and they bore the scars and
calluses of that earlier life.

He prayed. The prayer was not for himself, though he had selfish needs
enough: the persistent pain in his left knee, the insomnia that had
plagued him since the mission entered its final approach phase, the doubt
that crouched in the back of his mind like a cat in shadow, patient and
unblinking. The prayer was for the mission. For the twenty-six men and
women aboard the Consolation -- twelve scientists, eight support crew, and
six members of the Jesuit order, of which Father Cho was the senior. For
the work they were about to begin. For the people they were about to meet.

The people of New Galilee.

The probe data had arrived on Earth four years before the Consolation
launched. Unmanned surveyor, standard package: atmospheric composition,
surface mapping, bioscan. The bioscan had returned the result that had
rewritten human history in a single data packet: complex life. Multicellular
organisms. Ecosystems. And, at the apex of the biosphere, tool-using
bipeds with settlements, agriculture, and what the analysis team had
cautiously described as "evidence of organized social behavior consistent
with cultural complexity."

Intelligent life. Alien intelligence. The first confirmed contact.

The scientific community had responded with an explosion of activity --
funding, planning, construction, recruitment. The Consolation was built in
eighteen months, crewed in six, launched with the full weight of the United
Nations Interstellar Authority behind it. The mission objectives were
clear: observe, document, attempt communication, and -- above all -- do
no harm.

The Vatican had responded differently. After three months of deliberation,
the Holy See had issued a statement: "The discovery of intelligent life
beyond Earth, if confirmed, presents no challenge to Catholic doctrine.
The creative power of God is not limited to a single world. The Church's
mission to all peoples extends, in principle, to all peoples, wherever
they may be found."

And so the Jesuits were aboard. Six priests, selected for linguistic
ability, cultural sensitivity, and what the Provincial had called
"theological flexibility" -- a quality that Father Cho suspected meant
"the ability to encounter something completely outside your conceptual
framework and not have a breakdown."

Father Cho had been chosen because he spoke seven languages, because he
had spent fifteen years in mission work in East Asia and West Africa,
because he had published a well-received book on interreligious dialogue,
and because, as the Provincial had told him privately, "you are the only
Jesuit I know who could meet God face-to-face and ask Him for a citation."

The knee ached. The fluorescent light buzzed. Father Cho crossed himself
and stood.

Through the chapel's one porthole -- round, small, barely larger than a
dinner plate -- he could see New Galilee. A blue-green sphere, smaller
than Earth, brighter, wreathed in clouds that caught the light of the red
dwarf sun and turned it to shades of amber and rose. A beautiful world.
A living world. A world that held, somewhere in its forests and fields
and settlements, beings who had never heard the name of Christ.

Or so Father Cho assumed.

He would be wrong.


II.

The Consolation landed on the eighteenth day of Advent, a coincidence that
Father Cho noted in his journal without comment. The landing site was a
broad plain near the coast of the largest continent, selected for its
proximity to the largest settlement visible from orbit -- a cluster of
structures that the survey team had estimated housed between two and five
thousand individuals.

First contact protocol was meticulous. Three weeks of observation from a
distance. Deployment of linguistic analysis drones. Construction of a
communication framework based on observed patterns of vocalization and
gesture. The xenolinguists -- Dr. Sarah Okonkwo and Dr. Pavel Semenov --
worked sixteen-hour days, building a lexicon from recordings of the
natives' speech: a melodic, tonal language with a grammar that Dr.
Okonkwo described as "surprisingly Indo-European in structure, which is
either a staggering coincidence or evidence that certain linguistic
structures are convergent."

The natives -- the crew called them the Gaeli, an informal shortening of
"Galileans" that stuck despite the xenolinguists' protests that it was
premature and culturally presumptuous -- the Gaeli were, at first glance,
remarkably humanoid. Bipedal, bilaterally symmetrical, roughly human-sized.
Their skin was a deep amber, their eyes large and dark, their features
refined in a way that struck several crew members as beautiful, though
beauty, as Dr. Okonkwo noted, was a profoundly unreliable cross-species
metric. They wore clothing -- woven fabrics, dyed in earth tones and
decorated with geometric patterns. They used tools of wood, stone, and a
bronze-like alloy. They had agriculture, animal husbandry, and what
appeared to be a written language -- symbols inscribed on clay tablets and
the walls of their larger buildings.

On the twenty-second day, the Gaeli came to them.

A delegation of six, walking in formal procession across the plain. They
carried no weapons. They wore what the crew recognized, with a jolt, as
ceremonial garments -- more elaborate than daily wear, decorated with
additional geometric patterns and small ornaments of polished stone.

They were expected. The observation drones had recorded the Gaeli
observing the Consolation from a distance, and the settlement had been
in a state of visible activity -- gatherings, processions, what looked
like preparations -- since the ship landed.

Commander David Chen met them at the base of the ship's ramp, flanked by
Dr. Okonkwo with a translation tablet and Father Cho, who had been
included in the contact team over the objections of the chief scientist,
Dr. Martin Haugen, who felt that the presence of a priest at first contact
sent the wrong message. Father Cho had pointed out, with Jesuit mildness,
that the Gaeli had no way of knowing what a priest was, and his presence
would send no message at all. Commander Chen had sided with Father Cho,
less from any religious conviction than from the practical observation that
Father Cho was the calmest person on the ship and calm was what first
contact needed.

The lead Gaeli -- tall, elderly, with patterns on its ceremonial garment
that the anthropologists had tentatively identified as markers of high
status -- stopped three paces from Commander Chen. It raised both hands,
palms outward. The gesture was universal enough, or convergent enough,
to need no translation: we come in peace, we are unarmed, we mean no harm.

Dr. Okonkwo activated the translation tablet. The Gaeli spoke -- a
sequence of melodic syllables, rising and falling, with a cadence that
sounded, to Father Cho's trained ear, unmistakably liturgical.

The tablet processed the speech for eleven seconds. Then it displayed
the translation:

"We have waited for you. The One Who Returns said you would come."

Commander Chen looked at Dr. Okonkwo. Dr. Okonkwo looked at the tablet.
Father Cho looked at the Gaeli elder and felt, for the first time in his
thirty-one years as a priest, the solid ground of his faith shift beneath
his feet.


III.

Over the following weeks, the translation improved, and the story that
emerged was -- depending on your perspective -- the most extraordinary
confirmation of faith in human history, or its most devastating challenge.

The Gaeli had a religion. This was not surprising; the anthropologists had
expected it, given the species' level of cultural development. Pre-
industrial civilizations on Earth had, without exception, developed
religious frameworks. It would have been remarkable if the Gaeli had not.

What was remarkable -- what sent Dr. Haugen into a three-day silence and
Father Cho into a week of prayer and made Commander Chen send a classified
message to Mission Control that took twenty-three years to arrive but
whose first three words, had they been public, would have transformed
human civilization -- was the content of the Gaeli religion.

They worshipped a figure they called the Lirael, which Dr. Okonkwo
translated, with increasing unease, as "the Bright One" or "the Light-
Bearer" or, in certain liturgical contexts, "the Word Made Flesh."

The Lirael, according to Gaeli scripture -- and they had scripture,
clay tablets inscribed with a sacred text that occupied a central place
in their culture -- the Lirael was a divine being who had taken mortal
form. Who had lived among the Gaeli as one of them. Who had taught
compassion, mercy, forgiveness, the love of neighbor, the primacy of the
spirit over the flesh. Who had healed the sick. Who had gathered followers.
Who had been betrayed by one of those followers and put to death by the
ruling authorities. And who had, three days after death, returned to life,
appeared to the faithful, and ascended into the sky with a promise to
return.

The parallels were not vague. They were not the kind of broad structural
similarities that comparative mythology routinely identified between
unrelated cultures -- the hero's journey, the dying-and-rising god, the
flood narrative. These were specific. Detailed. Point-by-point
correspondences that went beyond structure into content.

The Lirael had been born of a virgin. The Lirael had been a carpenter.
The Lirael had twelve close followers, one of whom betrayed him. The
Lirael had been executed by a method that involved being suspended --
not on a cross, but on a frame of wood, which in the Gaeli context served
the same cultural function.

Father Cho read the translations. He read them in his cabin, alone, with
the door locked and the crucifix from Seoul on the wall above his desk.
He read them with the careful, critical eye of a man trained in textual
analysis by the most rigorous academic tradition in the history of
Christianity. He checked the translations against the original recordings.
He consulted with Dr. Okonkwo on every ambiguity, every possible
alternative rendering, every point at which the translation might have
been influenced by the translator's (or the machine's) cultural
assumptions.

The parallels held. Under scrutiny, under challenge, under the most
skeptical analysis Father Cho could bring to bear, the parallels held.

The Gaeli had a Christ. Not a Christ-like figure, not an archetype, not a
mythological echo. A Christ. A being whose life, teaching, death, and
resurrection mapped onto the Gospel narrative with a fidelity that was,
by any reasonable standard, impossible.

Father Cho put down the translations. He looked at the crucifix. The
carved figure of the suffering Christ looked back at him with the serene
agony that had been the central image of his faith for thirty-one years.

"What are you?" he whispered.

The crucifix did not answer. Crucifixes never did, which was, Father Cho
had always believed, the point.


IV.

The mission fractured along predictable lines.

Dr. Haugen, the chief scientist, took the position that the parallels
were coincidental. "Convergent cultural evolution," he argued, in a
meeting that lasted seven hours and resolved nothing. "Given a sufficient
number of civilizations, some will independently develop mythological
frameworks with superficial similarities. The details that seem to match
are artifacts of translation bias. We're seeing what we expect to see."

"The translation is sound," Dr. Okonkwo said, with the quiet ferocity
of a woman whose professional competence had been questioned. "I've
verified it independently of the machine. The parallels are not artifacts.
They are features of the text."

"Then the text is contaminated. The observation drones were broadcasting
on open frequencies. The Gaeli may have intercepted our cultural
databases and incorporated elements of our mythology into their own."

"Their scripture is inscribed on clay tablets that carbon-date to
approximately twelve hundred years before our arrival. Unless the Gaeli
have time machines, they did not copy our mythology."

The argument went in circles. Haugen's position was scientifically
conservative and emotionally comfortable: coincidence, contamination,
convergence. The parallels were remarkable but explicable. No supernatural
explanation was required.

Father Cho's fellow Jesuits were divided. Father Antoine Mbeki, the
youngest of the six, was exultant. "Universal revelation!" he declared,
his eyes bright with a fervor that made Father Cho uneasy. "God sent His
Son not only to Earth but to every world that bears intelligent life. The
Gospel is not a local event -- it is a cosmic one. Christ is universal.
This confirms everything!"

Father Hans Richter, the eldest, was more cautious. "It could also be a
test," he said, in his slow, precise way. "A challenge to the uniqueness
of the Incarnation. If Christ came to every world, then the Incarnation
was not a singular, unrepeatable event -- it was a pattern. A template.
And a template is not a miracle; it is a mechanism."

"A mechanism of grace," Father Mbeki said.

"Or a mechanism of nature. That is the question."

Father Cho listened to all of them. He listened with the patience that
was, as his fellow Jesuit had once noted, the topography of his face. And
he said nothing, because he did not yet know what to say.

He knew what he felt. What he felt was the vertigo of a man who has spent
his life standing on a rock and has just been told that the rock is
floating. Not that the rock is an illusion -- it was still solid underfoot,
still bore his weight -- but that it was not fixed. It was not the
immovable foundation he had believed it to be. It was a raft on a sea
whose depth he had never suspected.

The Gospel of Jesus Christ, the unique and unrepeatable entry of God into
human history, the central event of Father Cho's faith and the organizing
principle of his life -- was it unique? Was it unrepeatable? Or was it one
instance of a pattern, one iteration of a divine algorithm, one movement
in a symphony that played across every world where consciousness had
arisen to ask the question: Is there a God, and does He love us?

Either answer was staggering. If the Incarnation was unique to Earth, then
what had happened on New Galilee was something else -- a coincidence so
improbable as to be essentially impossible, or a deception of cosmic
proportions, or a phenomenon that transcended both theology and science
and for which no human framework was adequate.

And if the Incarnation was not unique -- if Christ had come to the Gaeli
as the Lirael, as He had come to humanity as Jesus of Nazareth -- then the
nature of God was vaster, stranger, and more generous than anything the
Church had imagined. The Incarnation was not a single gift but an
inexhaustible one, given and re-given across the breadth of creation, and
the Cross was not one tree but a forest, and the Resurrection was not one
morning but an eternal dawn breaking over world after world after world.

Father Cho did not know which possibility frightened him more.


V.

He went to the Gaeli.

He went alone, which violated first-contact protocol, and he went at dawn,
which was not the approved contact window. Commander Chen would reprimand
him later, and Father Cho would accept the reprimand with Jesuit grace,
because what he needed to do could not be done by committee.

The Gaeli settlement was a mile from the Consolation's landing site. Father
Cho walked across the plain in the amber light of the red dwarf sun, his
cassock trailing in the damp grass, his breath making small clouds in the
cool morning air. New Galilee's atmosphere was denser than Earth's, richer
in oxygen, and the effect was a slight giddiness, a sharpening of the
senses, a feeling of heightened presence that Father Cho recognized as
similar to the effects of altitude or fasting.

The settlement was a collection of low, rounded buildings made from a
composite of clay, wood, and woven fiber. They were arranged in concentric
circles around a central structure that was larger and more elaborate than
the others -- a temple, the anthropologists had determined. The Gaeli's
place of worship.

A Gaeli watched him approach. An elder -- one of the delegation that had
come to the ship on first contact day. It stood at the edge of the
settlement with an expression that Father Cho, who had spent thirty-one
years reading human faces and three weeks learning to read Gaeli ones,
interpreted as unsurprised expectation. It had been waiting for him.

"I wish to see the temple," Father Cho said, using the simplified pidgin
that he and Dr. Okonkwo had developed for basic communication.

The elder inclined its head. It turned and walked toward the central
structure, and Father Cho followed.

The temple was circular, open to the sky through a wide oculus in the
domed roof. The interior walls were covered with inscriptions -- the same
geometric script that appeared on the clay tablets -- and with images.
Paintings, executed in mineral pigments on the clay surface, depicting
scenes from the life of the Lirael.

Father Cho moved slowly around the interior. His heart was beating hard
and his mouth was dry, but his eyes were steady.

The paintings told a story.

Here: a figure in white, standing among the Gaeli, hands extended in
teaching. The Lirael, instructing the faithful. The composition was
different from any Christian iconography Father Cho had seen -- the
proportions were alien, the color palette unfamiliar, the artistic
conventions those of a culture that was not human -- but the narrative
content was unmistakable. A teacher. A holy one. A bringer of light.

Here: the Lirael surrounded by twelve figures, each one distinguished by
a different colored garment. The followers. The disciples. Father Cho
counted them twice. Twelve.

Here: a scene of betrayal. One of the twelve, face turned away, receiving
something -- a small object, indistinct -- from a figure in dark
garments. Thirty pieces of silver, Father Cho thought, and immediately
corrected himself: the Gaeli did not use silver. The object was a crystal,
perhaps. The specific currency did not matter. The act was the same.

Here: the Lirael on the wooden frame. Not a cross -- a triangular
structure, three beams joined at the top, the figure suspended at the
center. The posture was different but the meaning was identical: a public
execution, a spectacle of suffering, a death imposed by authority and
witnessed by followers.

And here: the final painting, directly opposite the entrance, positioned
so that it was the first thing a worshipper would see upon entering the
temple. The Lirael, risen. Standing in a garden -- or what passed for a
garden on New Galilee, a grove of luminous trees with bark like polished
copper -- with arms raised and face turned upward toward the open sky
visible through the oculus. And in the sky, visible through the painting's
sky and through the temple's real sky simultaneously, the red dwarf sun,
warm and close.

Father Cho stood before the resurrection painting for a long time.

The elder stood beside him. It spoke, and the words, though Father Cho
understood only half of them, carried a meaning that required no
translation:

This is our story. This is who we are. This is what we believe.

Father Cho reached into the pocket of his cassock and took out a small
object: a holy card, dog-eared and faded, that he had carried since his
ordination. It depicted Christ in the garden after the Resurrection, the
traditional "Noli me tangere" scene. Mary Magdalene, reaching for Him.
Christ, gently drawing back.

He held it up so the elder could see it.

The elder looked at the card. Its large, dark eyes moved from the image
to Father Cho's face and back again. And then it did something that
Father Cho would remember for the rest of his life.

It pressed its hand against its chest -- the Gaeli gesture, he had
learned, for recognition. For acknowledgment. For the feeling of
encountering something known in an unexpected place.

"Lirael," the elder said, pointing to the card.

"Christ," Father Cho said.

"Lirael," the elder repeated. And then, in a word that was not Gaeli and
was not any human language but was somehow comprehensible, as if it
predated both species and both tongues, it said:

"Same."


VI.

The message Father Cho composed that evening took him four hours to write.
It was addressed to the Father General of the Society of Jesus, and by
extension to the Holy See, and by extension to every Christian on Earth.
It would take twenty-three years to arrive. By the time it was read,
Father Cho would be an old man -- if he was alive at all. But the message
needed to be sent, and it needed to be right.

He sat in his cabin and wrote. He crossed out and rewrote. He prayed and
wrote again.

The final version was three pages. Father Cho was not a man who needed
many words.

The relevant passage read:

"I have seen the temple of the Gaeli, and I have seen their scripture, and
I have spoken with their elders. The parallels between their faith and ours
are not superficial. They are profound, specific, and, as far as I am able
to determine, genuine.

"I do not claim to understand what this means. I am a priest, not a
theologian of sufficient stature to pronounce on such matters. But I will
share what I believe, knowing that twenty-three years of reflection may
change my mind before these words are read.

"I believe that God is larger than we knew. I believe that the Incarnation,
which we have understood as a singular event -- God entering human history
at a specific time and place, in the person of Jesus of Nazareth -- may be
a singular event that occurs more than once. This is a paradox, but our
faith has never been afraid of paradox. The Trinity is a paradox. The
Incarnation itself is a paradox -- God who is infinite, contained in flesh
that is finite.

"If God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, then
perhaps 'the world' is larger than one planet, and 'His only begotten Son'
is a truth that expresses itself differently in different soils but is
always the same truth, the same love, the same sacrifice.

"The Gaeli call Him Lirael. We call Him Christ. I stood in their temple
and I showed them our image and they knew Him. Not as a stranger. Not as
a curiosity. They knew Him the way we know Him -- as the center of
everything.

"I do not believe this diminishes our faith. I believe it enlarges it
beyond our capacity to contain, which is, I suspect, precisely where faith
has always been meant to exist: beyond our capacity. Beyond our
comprehension. Beyond the walls of any single temple, whether that temple
is built of stone in Rome or of clay on a world orbiting a red dwarf
star twenty-three light-years from home.

"The universe is larger than we knew. God is larger than we knew. The
Gospel is larger than we knew. I do not find this frightening. I find it
-- and I use this word with full awareness of its inadequacy -- I find it
glorious."


VII.

Dr. Haugen was not persuaded. Dr. Haugen would never be persuaded. The
scientific explanation -- convergent cultural evolution, translation bias,
the human tendency to pattern-match -- was, for Haugen, sufficient and
complete. Father Cho did not begrudge him this. Faith was not a conclusion
reached by argument; it was a response to encounter, and Haugen had not
encountered what Father Cho had encountered. They had seen the same
paintings, heard the same translations, stood in the same temple. But they
had not seen the same thing.

Father Mbeki was persuaded, too persuaded, his exultation hardening into a
certainty that Father Cho found almost as troubling as Haugen's skepticism.
Certainty was the enemy of faith; faith required not knowing, required the
willingness to stand in the dark and trust that the ground was there. Father
Mbeki wanted floodlights. He wanted proof. He wanted the Gaeli temple to be
a second Jerusalem, a confirmation that erased all doubt. But doubt was the
shadow cast by faith, and without the shadow, the light had no shape.

Father Richter was somewhere in between -- cautious, thoughtful, unwilling
to commit. "We need time," he said. "We need decades of study. We need to
learn the Gaeli language fully, to understand their theology in its own
terms, not through the distorting lens of our own. We are at the very
beginning of understanding what this means."

Father Cho agreed. They were at the beginning. And the beginning was the
right place to be, because the beginning was where all the important
things happened -- the first word, the first light, the first moment of
awareness that the universe contained more than one voice.

He went back to the temple. He went many times, in the weeks and months
that followed. He sat with the Gaeli elders and he learned their language
-- properly, not through machines, but the slow, laborious, intimate way
that language is truly learned: by listening, by making mistakes, by
being corrected, by listening again.

He learned their prayers. He learned their hymns. He learned the stories
they told their children about the Lirael -- stories that were different
from the Gospels in a thousand surface details and identical in the single
detail that mattered: that God had loved them enough to become one of them,
to live as they lived, to suffer as they suffered, to die as they died, and
to rise again.

One evening, as the red sun set and the amber light filled the temple
through the oculus, the Gaeli elder who had first received Father Cho
asked him a question.

"Your people," the elder said, speaking slowly so that Father Cho could
follow. "They have the Lirael also. Your image. The man on the wood."

"Yes."

"But your people -- some of them do not believe. The one with the loud
voice." The elder meant Dr. Haugen, who had visited the temple once and
left in visible agitation. "He does not believe."

"No. Many of my people do not believe."

The elder considered this. "Among our people also. Some believe. Some
do not. The Lirael does not require belief. The Lirael requires only--"
The elder paused, searching for the word. Then it placed its hand against
its chest -- the gesture of recognition -- and said, "This. The Lirael
requires only this."

Recognition. The feeling of encountering something known. Not certainty.
Not proof. Not theological argument. Simply the moment of looking at
something -- a painting in a temple, a sunset, a stranger's face, a
story told across twenty-three light-years -- and knowing, in a way that
was prior to reason and deeper than doubt, that it was true.

Father Cho placed his own hand against his own chest.

"Yes," he said. "Among my people, we call that faith."

The elder nodded. And then it did something that Father Cho had never
seen a Gaeli do: it smiled. Not a human smile -- the facial musculature
was different, the expression subtly alien -- but unmistakably a smile.
A recognition, across the gulf of species and worlds and twenty-three
light-years of empty space, that something was shared.

Father Cho smiled back.

Outside the temple, the red sun touched the horizon and the sky of New
Galilee turned the color of old gold, and the first stars appeared --
faint, distant, each one a sun with its own worlds and its own
possibilities and its own unanswered questions -- and in the temple, a
priest and an elder sat together in the dying light and said nothing,
because the silence between them was a kind of prayer, and the prayer
was the oldest prayer in the universe:

Thank you. Thank you for not leaving us alone.

                         ABOUT THE AUTHORS
============================================================================

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV holds a doctorate in mathematical physics from the
University of Vienna and has published extensively on the philosophy of
mind. "Alena's Divergence" is his fourth appearance in these pages.
Dr. Koslov tells us the story was inspired by a conversation with a
colleague about Goedel's incompleteness theorems: "If mathematics itself
contains truths that cannot be proven from within the system, what does
that imply about the system that is us?" He resides in Cambridge,
Massachusetts, where he teaches and continues to argue with his cat about
determinism. The cat, he reports, remains unconvinced.

REX DRUMMOND is the author of more than forty published stories in the
science fiction and western genres, and is the creator of the popular
"Frontier Stars" series. He writes from his ranch in Tucson, Arizona,
where he raises horses and shoots competitively. "Gunslinger's Moon" is
his second story for TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND (the first being
"Red Planet Reckoning" in our March issue). Rex writes: "I've always
believed the frontier is a state of mind, not a place. Put a man with
a gun on any world you like -- the moral questions stay the same."

THEODORE CAIN is a rising talent whose work has appeared in Galaxy,
Astounding, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. A former
insurance adjuster from Cleveland, Ohio, Cain draws on his experience
with "the business of human value" in crafting stories about the
commodification of experience. "Bottled Days" is his first story
for this magazine, and we are delighted to welcome him. He is currently
at work on a novel.

LUCIAN MARSH is the pseudonym of an author who prefers to remain
anonymous, a preference we respect absolutely and without reservation.
Marsh's stories have appeared in Weird Tales, Unknown, and various
publications of a literary character. The prose speaks for itself. We will
say only that "Moth and Flame" is, in this editor's opinion, one
of the finest pieces of cosmic horror -- if horror is even the right word
-- that we have had the privilege to publish. More from Marsh soon, if the
darkness permits.

DANNY KOWALSKI is nineteen years old and a sophomore at the University of
Wisconsin-Madison, where he studies biology and writes for the campus
literary magazine. "Twelve of Pete" is his first professional sale.
We bought it within twenty-four hours of receiving the manuscript, which
is, we believe, a record for this magazine. Danny writes with a freshness
and emotional honesty that the field needs badly. He tells us: "I wrote
Pete because I wanted to write about someone who finds out he's not unique
and decides that's okay. That felt like a story worth telling." We agree.
Remember this name.

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO is the pen name of a Jesuit priest and scholar whose
academic work in comparative theology has taken him to four continents.
He has published two previous stories in TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND
("The Cartographer of Heaven" in Issue #3, and "Vespers at Tau Ceti" in
Issue #5). Father Aquino writes to explore the intersection of faith and
the unknown, a territory he considers "the most fertile ground in all of
science fiction." Of "A Sermon in Starlight," he says simply: "I wrote the
story I needed to read." We suspect many readers will feel the same.

                    SIGNALS RECEIVED -- LETTERS COLUMN
============================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished your June issue and I must protest in the strongest
terms. The story "Chromatic" by W.P. Hendricks, while technically
accomplished, presents a future in which machines have replaced human
artists entirely. As a painter myself, I find this vision not merely
pessimistic but offensive. Art is the province of the human soul. No
machine, however cleverly programmed, can replicate the spark of genuine
creativity. I expected better from your magazine.

                                        Yours sincerely,
                                        Mrs. Dorothy Albrecht
                                        Rhinebeck, New York

[Mrs. Albrecht -- You may be right. But I notice you described the story
as "technically accomplished," which suggests Mr. Hendricks's human soul
was doing just fine when he wrote it. The question of machine creativity
is one we will return to in future issues, and we welcome all
perspectives. -- H.S.]

Dear Editor,

Three cheers for Dr. Koslov's "The Shape of Silence" in your May issue!
At last, a science fiction writer who understands that the universe is
not obligated to be comprehensible. Too many stories in this genre assume
that all mysteries are solvable and all aliens are translatable. Koslov
has the courage to depict a mystery that remains mysterious. More of this,
please.

                                        With admiration,
                                        Gerald P. Hartwick

                                        Pasadena, California

[Professor Hartwick -- Dr. Koslov will be pleased. His new story in this
issue may test your appetite for the mysterious even further. -- H.S.]

Dear Tales from the Future,

I am twelve years old and I read your magazine every month. My favorite
story so far is "The Boy from Station Nine" by Danny Kowalski in your
April issue. I liked it because the boy was scared but he did the right
thing anyway. I would like to be a science fiction writer when I grow up.
Do you have any advice?

                                        Your reader,
                                        Timothy Chen
                                        San Jose, California

[Timothy -- Read everything. Write every day. Don't let anyone tell you
that science fiction is not real literature. And send us a story when
you're ready. We'll be here. -- H.S.]

~

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I write to correct an error in your May editorial, in which you stated
that the speed of light is 186,000 miles per second. The precise figure
is 186,282 miles per second. In a magazine that prides itself on
scientific accuracy, such sloppiness is regrettable.

                                        Precisely yours,
                                        Albert V. Newcomb
                                        Schenectady, New York

[Mr. Newcomb -- You are correct, and we are chastened. We have instructed
our typesetters to add the missing 282 miles per second to all future
references. We trust the universe will adjust accordingly. -- H.S.]

~

Dear Harrison,

Just a note to say that the June issue was your best yet. The balance
of hard science and human drama, the range of voices, the quality of
the prose -- it all came together beautifully. I've been reading science
fiction magazines since the Gernsback era, and I can say without
hesitation that TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND is doing something new.
Keep it up.

                                        Warm regards,
                                        Isaac Greenbaum
                                        Brooklyn, New York

[Mr. Greenbaum -- From your lips to the newsstand's ears. Thank you.
-- H.S.]

                THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW -- REVIEWS
============================================================================

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clarke
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.50)

Reviewed by Margaret Wu, Associate Editor

Arthur Clarke has written the novel that the rest of us have been
circling around for years. CHILDHOOD'S END posits an alien arrival that
is, for once, genuinely benign -- the Overlords come not to conquer but
to shepherd humanity toward its next evolutionary leap -- and then
follows that premise to its logical, devastating, magnificent conclusion.

The prose is Clarke at his best: lucid, precise, and capable of sudden
passages of breathtaking beauty. The ideas are immense. The characters
are -- well, this is Clarke's familiar weakness; they are adequate vessels
for the ideas rather than fully realized human beings. But the ideas are
so grand, and so rigorously explored, that the thinness of the
characterization matters less than it might in a lesser writer's hands.

What lingers is the ending. I will not spoil it. I will say only that
Clarke has the courage to follow his premise to a conclusion that is
simultaneously triumphant and heartbreaking, and that the final pages
contain an image that I expect to be thinking about for the rest of my
life.

Essential reading. The novel of the year, and possibly the decade.

~

THE DEMOLISHED MAN by Alfred Bester
(Shasta Publishers, 1953, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Bester's first novel is a jazz solo performed at the speed of thought.
In a future where telepathy is commonplace and murder is therefore
theoretically impossible, a corporate magnate attempts to commit the
perfect crime. The plot is a locked-room mystery turned inside out: the
room is the killer's mind, and the lock is an entire society of mind-
readers.

The prose is electric. Bester writes with a kinetic energy that makes
most science fiction feel like it's standing still. His typographical
experiments -- visual poems, word-pattern games, pages that must be read
in multiple directions -- are not gimmicks but genuine innovations in
how science fiction can use the printed page.

If the novel has a flaw, it is that Bester's relentless pace sometimes
sacrifices emotional depth for narrative velocity. But what velocity it
is. This is science fiction with its hair on fire, and it is magnificent.

Winner of the first Hugo Award, and deservedly so.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $3.00)

Reviewed by Margaret Wu

Sturgeon's novel about a gestalt organism -- a group of damaged
individuals who together form a single, superhuman entity -- is the most
emotionally devastating science fiction novel I have read in years. Where
Clarke operates on the cosmic scale and Bester on the cerebral, Sturgeon
works at the level of the human heart, and the result is a novel that
makes you weep and then makes you understand why you're weeping.

The prose is gorgeous -- Sturgeon is, sentence for sentence, the finest
stylist in the field -- and the structure is bold, telling the story in
three overlapping sections from different perspectives. The characters
are painfully real: the idiot Lone, the telekinetic twins, the teleporter
baby, the telepath Gerry. Each one is broken. Together, they are whole.
That is the novel's thesis, and Sturgeon proves it not through argument
but through story, which is the only proof that matters.

If Clarke's CHILDHOOD'S END is the novel of ideas, and Bester's THE
DEMOLISHED MAN is the novel of energy, then Sturgeon's MORE THAN HUMAN
is the novel of feeling. All three are masterpieces. 1953 is a year to
remember.
