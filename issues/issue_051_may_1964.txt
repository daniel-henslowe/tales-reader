TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITORS' DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

Let us make a confession. When we sat down to plan this issue, we made a
decision that some of you will find exhilarating and others will find
unconscionable: we have not included a single spaceship.

Well — that is not entirely true. There are spaceships in these stories,
or at least the memory of spaceships, the consequence of spaceships, the
colonies that spaceships planted on distant worlds. But in none of these
six stories does a rocket engine fire. No one escapes Earth's gravity well.
No one calculates a trajectory or dodges an asteroid. The void between the
stars, that great dark ocean that has been this magazine's natural habitat
for eleven years, is present only as a backdrop — a painted scrim behind
the real action, which takes place somewhere far more treacherous and far
less mapped.

We are speaking, of course, of the space between your ears.

This is our "inner space" issue, and it has been Diana's pet project since
she joined the editorial desk in January. The term itself belongs to J.G.
Ballard, who argued in a New Worlds editorial that science fiction's true
frontier is not outer space but the human psyche — that the most alien
territory in the universe is the interior landscape of consciousness,
perception, and dream. We do not agree with everything Mr. Ballard has
written on the subject (Max, in particular, retains a stubborn fondness
for rockets), but the core insight strikes us as exactly right, and it is
the organizing principle of the issue you hold in your hands.

Miriam Blackwell opens our pages with "Interpretation of Storms," a story
that asks what happens when the weather itself becomes a symptom — when a
planet's atmosphere mirrors the emotional states of its inhabitants, and
one man's grief can freeze an entire colony. It is psychological science
fiction of the most rigorous and unsettling kind, and it announces,
unmistakably, that we are in new territory.

Julian St. Croix follows with "Folded Man," a story about a physicist who
discovers he can fold himself through higher dimensions of space — and who
finds that transcendence, like any drug, has a cost. St. Croix writes like
no one else in these pages, or anyone else's pages for that matter, and we
suspect this story will provoke the same division of opinion as everything
he touches: half of you will call it a masterpiece, and the other half
will write us angry letters. We welcome both responses.

Zara Nix makes a debut that we expect will be talked about for some time.
"Seven Masks for the End of the World" is an experimental piece — seven
fragments, seven perspectives, seven ways of facing the last hour before
an asteroid strikes. There is no rescue, no escape, no technological
solution. There is only consciousness confronting its own extinction. It
is not comfortable reading. We believe it is important reading.

Theodore Cain, the most reliable man in science fiction, turns his hand to
noir with "Memory Palace of Phobos," a mystery about stolen memories and
a crime buried in the dead cities of Mars. It is, as always with Cain,
expertly constructed, compulsively readable, and deeper than it first
appears.

Father Thomas Aquino offers "Pilgrim's Regression," a time-travel story
in which a man journeys backward through the history of Christianity
seeking a faith uncorrupted by human politics. What he finds is more
interesting, and more consoling, than what he was looking for. It is the
kind of story only Father Aquino could write — patient, wise, and quietly
devastating.

And Lucian Marsh closes the issue with "No Frequency Response," in which
a radio astronomer receives signals that carry not information but raw
alien terror. Marsh has always been our poet of cosmic dread, and this
story may be his most disturbing meditation on what it means to listen to
the void — and what it means if the void listens back.

Six stories. Not a ray gun among them. We make no apologies.

The future is not only out there. It is in here.

Yours in the interior,

                      INTERPRETATION OF STORMS

                        by Miriam Blackwell

================================================================================

                              I.

The snow had been falling for eleven months when Dr. Lena Sarova finally
admitted, to herself if not to the colonial administration, that it was
not going to stop.

She stood at the window of her consulting room on the fourth floor of
the Kepler Settlement Psychological Services building and watched it
come down — not the dramatic, wind-driven blizzard it had been in the
early months, but a slow, exhausted falling, like the last confetti at
a parade that has gone on far too long. Fat, grey flakes drifting through
air that was itself grey, settling on rooftops that were no longer
visible as rooftops but only as soft, rounded humps in a landscape that
was losing its geometry, losing its edges, becoming something smooth and
undifferentiated and still.

The temperature outside was minus thirty-one. It had not been above
freezing since the previous June.

Lena pressed her fingertips against the glass — cold, an ache that
bloomed through the pads of her fingers and up into her wrists, a
sensation she had learned to read the way a doctor reads a pulse. On
Caeli IV, you could feel the colony's mood in the weather. Not
metaphorically. Not in the loose, poetic sense that a grey day might
reflect a grey disposition. Literally. The planet's atmosphere was
coupled to the collective emotional state of its human inhabitants through
a mechanism that the xenoclimatologists called psychoatmospheric
resonance and that everyone else called the Mood, capitalizing it the
way you capitalize a proper noun or a god.

The Mood was the reason Kepler Settlement existed. Caeli IV had been
colonized specifically because of this phenomenon — a world where the
boundary between inner experience and outer environment was not a
boundary at all but a membrane, permeable and bidirectional. The
research possibilities were extraordinary. Psychologists, neurologists,
consciousness researchers — they had come from Earth and the inner
colonies in the first wave, giddy with the implications. A planet that
could externalize subjective states! A world where you could literally
see what people felt! The papers would write themselves. The grants would
flow like rivers.

And they had. For seven years, the research colony on Caeli IV had been
a model of productive scientific enthusiasm, its atmospheric readings
correlating neatly with population surveys, its weather patterns
providing an objective map of subjective experience that was, frankly,
too good to be true.

The trouble, Lena thought, pressing her fingers harder against the cold
glass, was that it had been too good to be true. They had understood the
Mood the way a child understands a piano: you press the keys and sounds
come out. But they had not understood the instrument. They had not
understood what happened when someone played it badly, or too loudly, or
would not stop playing.

They had not understood that the Mood could get stuck.

She turned away from the window. Her consulting room was warm — the
colony's heating systems were functioning, if barely — and decorated with
the careful neutrality that her training demanded: muted colors, indirect
lighting, two comfortable chairs arranged at a conversational angle, a
low table between them with a carafe of water and two glasses. No sharp
edges. No distracting patterns. A space designed to be a container for
whatever the patient brought into it.

Her next patient was the reason for the winter.

His name was Eron Vos, and he was, according to the colonial
administration, the single largest contributor to the psychoatmospheric
anomaly that had held the settlement in continuous snowfall for nearly
a year. The monitoring stations had triangulated his emotional signature
weeks ago — a dense, low-frequency pattern of grief that pulsed outward
from his quarters like a heartbeat, like a slow drum, like something
vast and dark turning over in its sleep. His grief was so deep and so
persistent that it was acting as an attractor in the Mood's nonlinear
dynamics, pulling the colony's collective emotional weather into a
stable basin of cold and dark from which it could not escape.

One man's sorrow, and an entire world frozen.

The administration wanted him treated. They had been diplomatic about it,
had used phrases like "psychological support" and "wellness intervention"
and "therapeutic resources." But the meaning was clear: Fix him. Make
him stop being sad. We are running out of stored food and solar battery
capacity and patience, and if this winter does not break soon, we will
have to evacuate the settlement, which will mean the end of seven years
of research and a hundred million credits of infrastructure, and all
because one man cannot stop grieving.

The door chimed.

"Come in," Lena said, and sat down in her chair, and composed her face
into the attentive neutrality that was, perhaps, its own form of weather
— a mild, temperate climate she maintained inside herself, inside this
room, while the world outside froze.

                              * * *

Eron Vos was a large man who moved as though he were trying to take up
less space than his body required. He was forty-three years old,
broad-shouldered, with hands that looked like they belonged to someone
who worked with soil or stone. His hair was dark and uncombed. His eyes
were the color of the sky outside — grey, flat, featureless. He wore a
heavy sweater and trousers that needed mending at one knee, and he sat
in the chair across from Lena with the careful, provisional quality of
a man who was not sure the chair would hold him.

He did not look like a catastrophe. He looked like a tired man who had
forgotten to eat breakfast.

"Thank you for coming in, Eron," Lena said.

"I was given to understand that it was not optional," he said. His voice
was low and uninflected. Not hostile. Not cooperative. A voice making
a factual observation.

"It was a strong recommendation."

"From Administrator Chen."

"From the medical team. I'm Dr. Sarova. I'm a psychotherapist."

"I know who you are." He looked at her with an expression that was not
quite resignation and not quite curiosity. "You're the person they've
asked to make me stop."

Lena held his gaze. This was the moment — the first moments always were —
when the frame of the therapeutic relationship was established, when the
implicit contract between patient and therapist was either negotiated or
imposed. She had no intention of imposing anything. She also had no
intention of pretending that the situation was other than what it was.

"I'm the person they've asked to help you," she said. "I'm aware that
the distinction may feel thin."

Something shifted in his face — a minute relaxation, as though he had
been braced for something worse and was recalibrating. "Honest," he said.
"All right. That's something."

"Can you tell me what happened? In your own words, at whatever pace feels
right."

He was quiet for a long time. Outside, the snow continued to fall. Lena
could feel it in her fingertips, that cold ache — the Mood pressing
against the building like a tide, like something with weight.

"My daughter," he said at last. "Mara. She was twelve. She died fourteen
months ago. A structural failure in the recreation dome — a support beam
fractured during a windstorm. She was the only casualty." He paused. "I
imagine you know this already."

"I've read your file. But a file is not a person."

"No," he said. "It's not." He looked at his hands. "The grief is —
I do not have adequate language for this. It is not an emotion. It is a
geography. It is the place where I live now. Every thought I have begins
there and ends there. Every morning I open my eyes and for perhaps half
a second the world is just the world, and then the knowledge comes back,
and it is as though the ground opens beneath me and I am falling, and I
never reach the bottom."

He said this without drama. He said it the way you report the weather.

Lena felt the temperature in the room drop — not metaphorically, not
figuratively, but actually, measurably, a shift of two or three degrees
as the Mood registered the emotional content of his words and translated
it into thermal reality. She saw the condensation form on the water
carafe. She saw her own breath begin to show, faintly, in the air
between them.

This was what it meant to practice therapy on Caeli IV. Your patient's
pain was not invisible. It was not confined to the interior of a skull,
accessible only through language, through inference, through the
imperfect archaeology of words. It was right there. It was the weather.

"I am sorry about Mara," Lena said. "That is a catastrophic loss, and
nothing I say will make it less so. I want to be clear about that from
the start."

"Then what are we doing here?"

"We're trying to understand something. Not to fix it — I'm suspicious of
that word. To understand it."

"The administration doesn't want understanding. They want the snow to
stop."

"I'm not the administration."

He looked at her for a long moment, and she felt the temperature
stabilize — not warm, but no longer dropping. A kind of equilibrium.
A man deciding whether to trust.

"All right," he said. "What do you want to know?"

                              II.

That night, Lena sat in her apartment and reviewed her notes.

The apartment was small — two rooms, functional furnishings, the standard
colonial issue that managed to be neither comfortable nor uncomfortable,
merely present. She had lived in it for three years and had done almost
nothing to personalize it, a fact that her therapist back on Earth (she
had maintained her own therapy through subspace sessions, because
therapists who did not have their own therapists were, in her experience,
dangerous) had noted with delicate concern.

She made tea and sat at her desk, which faced a window that showed only
the wall of the adjacent building, three meters away, both surfaces
furred with ice crystals.

Her notes on Eron Vos:

Grief reaction following the death of his daughter Mara, age twelve,
fourteen months ago. Structural failure in the recreation dome — a
support beam fracture during a windstorm. Single casualty. The grief
presents as pervasive, totalizing, resistant to the natural attenuation
that bereavement typically undergoes over time. No evidence of
complicated grief in the clinical sense — no distortion, no avoidance
of reality, no magical thinking. He knows she is dead. He knows she is
not coming back. He is not bargaining with the universe or refusing to
accept the facts.

He is simply grieving. Fully, completely, without reservation or
self-protection.

And the Mood is translating that grief into winter.

Lena set down her pen and pressed her palms against her eyes. The
professional in her could enumerate the therapeutic approaches: cognitive
behavioral interventions to challenge rumination patterns, behavioral
activation to re-engage with the world, pharmacological support to
modulate the neurochemical substrate of depression. She had the tools.
She had used them before, on Earth and here, and they worked — not
perfectly, not always, but they worked.

But something was wrong with the frame. Something about this case was
not fitting into the clinical categories, and she could not yet identify
what it was.

She went to bed and lay in the dark and listened to the wind — a low,
constant moan that had become the colony's ambient sound, as
unremarkable and as inescapable as the hum of a refrigerator. She fell
asleep thinking about Eron Vos's hands, the way they rested on his
knees, heavy and still, as though they were holding something down.

                              * * *

The second session. Three days later. The snow had not changed.

"Tell me about Mara," Lena said.

Eron sat in the same chair, in the same posture, wearing what might have
been the same clothes. "What aspect of Mara?"

"Any aspect. Whatever comes."

He was quiet, and then he spoke, and what emerged was not a clinical
history but a portrait, built in fragments, the way a mosaic is built —
tile by tile, each one a specific color, a specific shape, the pattern
emerging only when you stepped back far enough to see the whole.

Mara at three, trying to catch snowflakes on her tongue during a
calibrated weather event — the researchers had induced light snow to
test the Mood's response parameters, and Mara had escaped the childcare
center and run outside in her pajamas, laughing, her arms spread wide.

Mara at seven, asking him why the sky was a different color when her
mother was sad, and could she make it blue by being happy enough for
both of them.

Mara at ten, beginning to understand the science of the Mood, reading
the research papers her father left on his desk with the terrifying
absorption of a child who has discovered that the world has a mechanism,
a logic, that it is not arbitrary.

Mara at twelve, three days before she died, sitting at the kitchen table
doing mathematics homework, and looking up at him and saying, "Dad, if
the Mood is connected to how we feel, then does that mean feelings are
real? Like, physically real? Not just things that happen inside us?"

And he had said yes. Feelings are real. They are as real as the snow.

The temperature in the consulting room had dropped steadily as he spoke.
Lena could see ice forming on the inside surface of the window. Her
breath came in visible plumes. Her fingers ached. She did not move, did
not reach for her coat, did not do anything that might signal to Eron
that his grief was an inconvenience, a problem, a thing that needed to
be managed.

She sat with him in the cold and let it be cold.

"She was extraordinary," she said, when he had finished.

"She was ordinary," he said. "She was a twelve-year-old girl. She liked
mathematics and climbing and a particular kind of mushroom soup. She was
not a prodigy. She was not remarkable. She was my daughter and she was
alive and now she is dead and the fact that the sky agrees with me about
this is the only honest thing that has happened on this planet in
fourteen months."

Lena felt something click into place — not a therapeutic insight, not
yet, but the precursor to one, the sense of a pattern beginning to
emerge at the edge of perception.

"What do you mean," she said, "the only honest thing?"

"I mean that everyone else has moved on." His voice did not rise. It
remained flat, controlled, a man reporting meteorological data. "Fourteen
months. The colony has grieved and recovered. People have returned to
their work, their routines, their relationships. They have processed
the tragedy and integrated it and filed it away. Administrator Chen sent
me a condolence card with a handwritten note. 'We share your loss.'
Three months later, he sent me a memo about the weather."

"And the weather is your grief."

"The weather is the truth. Mara is dead. She died because a support beam
was not properly rated for the wind loads on this planet, because the
engineering specifications were drawn up by people on Earth who had
never stood in a Caeli IV windstorm, because the colonial administration
approved the recreation dome design without commissioning an independent
structural review, because it was cheaper not to, because twelve-year-old
girls are not, in the cost-benefit calculus of colonial administration,
a sufficient reason to spend an additional forty thousand credits on
reinforced construction."

He paused. The room was very cold now. Lena's teeth wanted to chatter.
She held them still.

"She died because of negligence," he said. "And no one wants to talk
about that. They want to talk about grief. They want to talk about
healing. They want to talk about the weather. They do not want to talk
about the fact that Kepler Settlement killed my daughter and then wrote
me a card."

                              III.

Lena did not sleep that night.

She sat at her desk with her notes and her tea and the wind outside and
the thought that would not resolve, that kept turning over and over like
a stone in a tumbler, wearing away its own surface to reveal whatever
was underneath.

The clinical question: Is Eron Vos's grief pathological?

The clinical answer, by every metric she knew: No.

His grief was proportional. His daughter had died. He grieved. The
intensity was extreme but not inappropriate to the loss. There was no
distortion, no dissociation, no departure from reality testing. He knew
what had happened. He understood it. He was not in denial.

The complicating factor — the factor that made the administration want
her to treat him, the factor that turned personal grief into a public
crisis — was the Mood. On any other planet, a man's grief was his own
business. On Caeli IV, it was the weather. His interior state was
externalized, made visible, made consequential in a way that collapsed
the boundary between private suffering and public life.

But that was a feature of the planet, not a feature of the patient.

And then there was the other thing — the thing he had said that she could
not stop hearing. She died because of negligence. And no one wants to
talk about it.

Lena pulled up the colony's administrative records — she had clearance,
as a member of the medical staff — and began to read. The recreation
dome incident report. The structural engineering specifications. The
inspection logs. The correspondence between the colonial administration
and the architectural firm on Earth that had designed the dome.

It took her three hours. When she was finished, her tea was cold, and
so was she — cold in a way that had nothing to do with the Mood and
everything to do with what she had just read.

Eron Vos was right.

The support beam that killed his daughter had been rated for wind loads
appropriate to a temperate Class B colony world with average surface
wind speeds of thirty to fifty kilometers per hour. Caeli IV's average
surface wind speeds, as documented in the xenoclimatological survey
conducted before colonization, were eighty to one hundred and ten
kilometers per hour, with storm gusts exceeding two hundred. The
discrepancy was noted in a memo from the colony's chief engineer to
Administrator Chen, eight months before the dome failure. The memo
recommended immediate structural reinforcement. The recommendation was
acknowledged and deferred pending budget review.

Budget review was still pending when the beam fractured.

There was no cover-up — the records were all there, filed properly,
accessible to anyone who looked. There was something worse than a
cover-up: there was indifference. The colony had treated Mara's death
as a tragedy — a terrible, unavoidable tragedy — and had grieved and
moved on. But it was not unavoidable. It was the predictable consequence
of a decision to save money, and no one had been held accountable, and
no one had even named the decision for what it was.

Lena closed the files and stared at the dark window.

The snow was still falling.

Of course it was still falling. The colony's grief had ended, but the
colony's grief had been shallow — a surface response, a weather system
that passed. Eron's grief was deep because Eron's grief was true, and
the truth it contained was not only "my daughter is dead" but "my
daughter was killed by negligence, and no one will say so."

And the Mood, that pitiless instrument, that planetary lie detector —
the Mood was amplifying the truth because the truth was being suppressed.
The winter was not a symptom of pathology. It was a symptom of honesty.

This changed everything.

                              IV.

The third session. Lena had not slept. She had spent the night thinking
about what it meant to be a therapist whose job was to help a man
grieve, when the man's grief was the most rational response available
to a situation that everyone else had decided to pretend was resolved.

"I read the engineering reports," she said.

Eron looked at her. For the first time, something moved behind the grey
flatness of his eyes — a flicker, like a fish turning in deep water.

"And?" he said.

"And you're right. The beam was under-specified. The chief engineer
flagged it. The administration deferred. Your daughter died because of
a decision to save money." She said it plainly, the way he had said it.
No clinical distance. No therapeutic frame. Just the words.

The temperature in the room did not drop. It held steady. Outside, for
the first time in weeks, the wind decreased — not dramatically, not
enough to notice unless you were listening for it, but Lena was
listening.

"No one has said that to me before," Eron said. "Not once. Not in
fourteen months. They have said they are sorry. They have said it was
a tragedy. They have not said it was a mistake."

"It was worse than a mistake. A mistake is accidental. This was a
calculated risk that was calculated wrong, and the cost fell on a
twelve-year-old girl."

He was quiet for a long time. The air in the room was still cold, but
it was a different cold — not the dense, dead cold of deep winter but
something sharper, cleaner, like the cold of a morning before sunrise.
A cold that had direction. A cold that was going somewhere.

"What happens now?" he asked.

"I don't know," Lena said. "But I'm not going to treat your grief as
the problem. Your grief is not the problem."

"The administration thinks it is."

"The administration wants the snow to stop. I want to understand why it
shouldn't."

He stared at her. She felt the weight of his attention — not the grey,
passive weight of depression but something more active, more searching.
A man reassessing.

"You could lose your position," he said.

"Yes."

"You could lose more than that. Chen doesn't like being challenged."

"I know."

"Then why?"

Lena thought about this. She thought about her training, which taught
her to maintain neutrality, to avoid taking sides, to serve the patient's
wellbeing without imposing her own values. She thought about the snow.
She thought about Mara Vos, twelve years old, doing mathematics at a
kitchen table, asking whether feelings were real.

"Because feelings are real," she said. "Isn't that the whole point of
this planet?"

                              * * *

She went to Administrator Chen that afternoon.

His office was on the top floor of the administrative building — warm,
well-lit, furnished with an authority that the rest of the colony's
institutional spaces lacked. Chen was a small, precise man with silver
hair and an expression of perpetual competence. He had run Kepler
Settlement for five years and had done it well, by most measures: the
research output was strong, the infrastructure was (mostly) functional,
the colonists were (mostly) satisfied. He was not a bad administrator.
He was a man who had made a cost-benefit calculation and had not yet been
required to confront the cost.

"Dr. Sarova," he said. "I was hoping for a progress report on the Vos
case."

"It's not a case," Lena said. "He's a man."

Chen's expression did not change, but something behind it tightened.
"Of course. How is Mr. Vos's treatment progressing?"

"It isn't. I'm not treating him."

"I beg your pardon?"

"His grief is not pathological. He is experiencing a rational emotional
response to a loss that was caused by institutional negligence —
negligence that has not been acknowledged, investigated, or addressed.
The psychoatmospheric anomaly is not a symptom of his illness. It is a
symptom of the colony's refusal to confront the truth."

She laid it out for him — the engineering reports, the memo, the deferred
maintenance, the structural specifications that did not match the
planet's actual conditions. She was calm. She was clinical. She used the
same voice she used with patients, the voice that said: I am not
attacking you. I am describing reality.

Chen listened. His face did not change. When she finished, there was a
long silence in which Lena could hear the heating system cycling and the
wind pressing against the windows and her own heartbeat, which was
faster than she would have liked.

"Dr. Sarova," Chen said at last. "I appreciate your thoroughness. But
you were asked to provide psychological treatment to a colonist whose
emotional state is causing a settlement-wide crisis. What you are
describing is an administrative review, which is outside your
professional competence and your assigned responsibilities."

"What I am describing is the cause of the crisis."

"The cause of the crisis is the psychoatmospheric anomaly generated by
Mr. Vos's grief. That is the variable we need to address."

"You want me to treat his grief so that the weather changes."

"I want you to help a man who is suffering."

"He is suffering because his daughter was killed by negligence. Treating
his grief without addressing the cause is not therapy. It's suppression."

Chen's expression hardened — a fractional change, a tightening around
the eyes, but on Caeli IV you learned to read small changes, because
small changes in people became large changes in weather. "Dr. Sarova.
You are a psychotherapist. Please do your job."

Lena stood. "I am doing my job," she said. "I am telling you what is
wrong with the patient. What is wrong with the patient is what happened
to him. If you want the winter to end, you are going to have to tell the
truth about how it started."

She left the office. In the corridor, she noticed that the light through
the windows had changed — not brighter, not warmer, but different in
quality. As though the clouds had shifted. As though something in the
atmosphere had registered a change in pressure.

                              V.

Word spread, as it always does in a small colony. Lena had challenged
Chen. Lena had refused to treat Vos. Lena had read the engineering
reports and had found something.

What had she found?

The question moved through the settlement like a weather front — which,
on Caeli IV, it was. Lena could feel the colony's emotional atmosphere
changing: the dull, grey resignation of the past months was being
infiltrated by something else, something sharp and uncomfortable. Not
anger, exactly. Not yet. Something more like the feeling of waking up —
that disoriented moment when you realize you have been asleep, and you
are not sure how long, and the room looks different in the light.

People began to ask questions. About the dome. About the beam. About
the memo that the chief engineer had written and the budget review that
had never been completed. The questions were quiet at first — murmured
in the dining hall, whispered in lab corridors — but they grew louder,
the way sound grows louder when it resonates with the right frequency,
when it finds the chamber that was built to amplify it.

And the weather responded. Not by ending the winter — not yet — but by
changing its character. The dead, static cold that had pressed down on
the settlement for months began to move. Wind picked up. Temperature
fluctuated. The snow came in gusts and squalls rather than in that
endless, exhausted drift. The atmosphere was agitated, disturbed,
stirring — not warm, but alive.

Lena's supervisor, Dr. Marcus Reade, called her into his office. Reade
was a good man — cautious, competent, more interested in the well-being
of his staff than in political maneuvering. He looked at her over his
glasses with an expression of weary concern.

"You've stirred something up," he said.

"Something needed stirring."

"Chen has filed a formal complaint. He says you've overstepped your
professional boundaries."

"I documented a material cause for my patient's psychological condition.
That's within my professional boundaries."

"You distributed engineering reports to a patient advocacy group."

"I showed relevant documents to people who had a right to see them. The
reports were not classified."

Reade sighed and took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
"Lena. I'm not disagreeing with you. The reports are damning. Chen's
office should have acted on that memo. But this — what you're doing —
this isn't therapy. This is advocacy."

"On Caeli IV," Lena said, "there is no difference. If a patient's
psychological state is determined by external conditions, then
addressing those conditions is therapy. If the colony's emotional
climate is shaped by suppressed truth, then the truth is the
intervention. This planet does not allow us the luxury of separating
the psychological from the political. That's what makes it terrifying.
And that's what makes it honest."

Reade put his glasses back on and looked at her for a long time. "Be
careful," he said.

She nodded. She was not sure careful was available to her anymore.

                              * * *

The fourth session with Eron. The snow had changed — lighter, intermittent,
with gaps of grey sky between squalls. The temperature had risen to minus
twenty. Still brutal. But moving.

"People are talking," Eron said. He sat in the same chair, but his
posture had shifted — less compressed, less folded in on himself. His
hands rested on his knees, but they were open now, palms up, as though
he were holding something he was deciding whether to release.

"How does that feel?" Lena asked.

"Strange." He paused. "For fourteen months, I have been the problem.
The man whose grief broke the weather. The aberration in the system.
And now people are coming to me and saying they are sorry. Not the way
they said it before — the condolence-card sorry, the we-share-your-loss
sorry. They are saying they are sorry that no one listened. They are
saying they are sorry about the beam."

"And how does that feel?"

He looked at her, and for the first time, the grey flatness of his
expression cracked, and what was underneath was not anger and not
sadness and not relief but something more complicated, something for
which Lena — with all her training, all her vocabulary, all her years
of practice — did not have a clinical term. It was the expression of a
man who had been carrying something alone and who had just felt, for
the first time, other hands reaching for the weight.

"It feels," he said slowly, "like the wind has changed."

She looked at the window. The snow had stopped.

Not permanently — she knew the Mood well enough to know that emotional
weather was not a binary, not an on-off switch, that healing was not
a line but a landscape with its own topography, its own storms and
clearings. The winter would return, in gusts, in flurries, in cold
mornings and long nights. But the static, the stuckness, the frozen
loop of unacknowledged truth — that had broken.

"It has," she said.

                              VI.

The colony held a meeting. Not an administrative briefing — a meeting,
the old-fashioned kind, in the central hall, with everyone present.
Chen attended. He had the look of a man who had realized that the
weather on Caeli IV was a referendum he could not campaign his way out of.

The chief engineer presented the report. The structural specifications.
The memo. The deferred maintenance. The cost-benefit analysis that had
weighed forty thousand credits against the structural integrity of a
recreation dome where children played.

People were angry. The Mood registered it — the temperature spiked, the
wind rose, rain lashed the windows in horizontal sheets. Lena stood
at the back of the hall and felt the anger move through the room like
a physical force, and she thought: this is what it looks like when an
emotion is real. Not metaphorically real. Not symbolically real.
Real. A force in the world, with weight and direction and consequence.

But anger was not the only thing in the room. There was grief — the
colony's grief, finally, belatedly, arriving. Not the shallow,
performative grief of condolence cards and shared-loss memos but
something deeper, something that had been deferred along with the budget
review, something that had to do with the recognition that Mara Vos
was dead and that her death was not a tragedy but a failure, their
failure, a failure of attention and priority and care.

The rain turned to snow — not the grey, exhausted snow of the long
winter but something softer, gentler, a snow that fell like mourning,
like a letting-go. Lena watched it through the hall windows and
thought: this is what collective grief looks like when it is not
suppressed. It is not a permanent winter. It is a storm that passes.

Chen stood up and spoke. He did not apologize — Lena suspected he was
not capable of apology — but he acknowledged the engineering reports
and announced that an independent structural review of all colony
buildings would be conducted immediately, and that the recreation dome
would be rebuilt to specifications appropriate to Caeli IV's actual
conditions. He announced the creation of a memorial for Mara Vos. He
announced, in bureaucratic language that Lena translated in her head
into plain speech, that the cost-benefit analysis would be revised to
account for the fact that on Caeli IV, the cost of human suffering
was not an externality.

It was not enough. It was not justice — justice would require
accountability, structural change, a reckoning with the institutional
culture that had allowed a memo to be filed and forgotten while a
twelve-year-old girl played beneath a beam that was waiting to fall.
But it was a beginning.

After the meeting, Lena found Eron in the corridor. He was standing at
a window, watching the snow. His face was wet.

"How are you?" she asked.

He was quiet for a long time. "My daughter is still dead," he said.
"Nothing that happened today changes that."

"No."

"But they said her name. In that room, in front of everyone, they said
her name and they said what happened and they did not call it a tragedy.
They called it a failure."

"Yes."

"That matters." He wiped his face with the back of his hand. "I did not
expect it to matter. I thought that no amount of acknowledgment could
change what I feel. But the weather — the weather knows the difference
between grief that is witnessed and grief that is alone."

Lena looked outside. The snow was tapering off. In the west — she had
not seen the west in eleven months, because the clouds had been total,
horizon to horizon, a sealed lid of grey — in the west, there was a
thin line of light. Not sunlight, not yet. But the possibility of
sunlight. A luminous crack in the overcast, like a door left ajar.

"Lena," Eron said. She looked at him. He was still watching the sky.
"Thank you. Not for making me better. I am not better. I will not be
better for a long time, and I may never be what I was before."

"I know."

"Thank you for believing me. For believing that the cold was not a
sickness. That it was — " He paused, searching for the word, and she
waited, because she was a therapist and waiting was what she did, and
also because she was a human being and she wanted to hear what he would
say.

"That it was evidence," he finished.

She nodded.

They stood together at the window and watched the line of light in the
west grow wider, brighter, warmer, as the clouds began — slowly,
unevenly, with the hesitant, recursive motion of all genuine healing —
to part.

                              VII.

Lena's case notes, final entry:

Patient Eron Vos. Sessions ongoing. Grief remains profound and
appropriate. Prognosis: gradual integration of loss into ongoing life,
facilitated by community acknowledgment of causal factors and
institutional accountability. The psychoatmospheric anomaly is
resolving — not because the patient's emotional state has been modified,
but because the colony's collective emotional state has been brought
into alignment with reality.

Recommendation: Continued therapeutic support for Vos. Continued
structural review of colony infrastructure. Continued attention to the
relationship between institutional honesty and psychoatmospheric
stability.

Note: This planet does not allow us to lie. It does not allow us to
suppress, to minimize, to file our grief away and move on before the
moving-on is earned. It makes our inner weather outer. It makes our
private pain public. This is terrifying. It may also be the most
important thing about it.

On Caeli IV, the truth is the weather. And the weather, eventually,
clears.

Personal addendum (not for the file):

Mara Vos was twelve years old. She liked mathematics and climbing and
a particular kind of mushroom soup. She asked her father if feelings
were real, and her father said yes.

They are. On this planet, on every planet, in every cold room and every
warm one, in every silence that contains a thing unsaid — they are real.

That is all I know.

That is enough.

                            [THE END]

                           FOLDED MAN

                        by Julian St. Croix

================================================================================

                              I.

Consider the lilies, how they grow in fields unpestered by dimension:
rooted in three-space, untroubled by the suspicion that the meadow
extends in directions the eye cannot follow. Consider, too, the man who
cannot stop considering — who has looked at the meadow and seen, in the
geometry of its grasses, the shadow of a folding that implies an
architecture vaster than any field, any world, any universe that
contents itself with length and breadth and height.

His name was Adrian Carre, and he had ruined himself with mathematics.

Not in the prosaic sense — not with debt or disgrace or the usual
wreckage that mathematicians, who are after all human beings and
therefore as susceptible as anyone to the gravitational pull of
self-destruction, scatter in the wake of their obsessions. Carre's
ruin was more precise. He had derived, through a sequence of
topological transformations that occupied eleven notebooks and the
better part of three years, a proof that the human body could be
folded through higher spatial dimensions in much the same way that a
letter is folded to fit an envelope: with care, with precision, and
with the understanding that what emerges from the envelope will
never quite lie flat again.

And then, because Adrian Carre was not the sort of man who could
discover a door without opening it, he had folded himself.

The first time was an accident — if anything that follows from three
years of deliberate mathematical inquiry can be called accidental.
He was sitting in his office at the Institut de Physique Theorique
in Paris, a room of precisely the dimensions and character you would
expect (books, blackboards, the faint sepulchral smell of chalk dust,
a window giving onto a courtyard where pigeons conducted their
interminable negotiations), and he was holding in his mind the final
transformation of his proof — not reading it from the page but
holding it, the way a musician holds a chord, all the notes
sounding simultaneously — when the room turned inside out.

Not metaphorically. The walls of his office did not merely appear to
invert; they inverted, or rather he inverted relative to them, or
rather the distinction between inverting and being inverted ceased
to be meaningful because the operation he had performed upon himself
was not a movement through space but a rearrangement of his
relationship to space, a rotation through a dimension that his
office, his body, and the entirety of the three-dimensional world
had been ignoring for the whole of its existence, the way one might
ignore a room in one's house by never opening its door.

He was, for a period that might have been an instant and might have
been an age (duration, too, was behaving oddly), simultaneously
inside his office and outside it — not outside in the courtyard or
the corridor but outside in a direction for which language had no
word, because language, like the human body, had evolved in three
dimensions and was unequipped for this. He could see the interior of
the walls, the wiring and plaster and the small dark territories of
mice. He could see the courtyard from above and below and from an
angle that was neither above nor below but orthogonal to both,
looking along the axis of a dimension that made the courtyard into a
cross-section of itself, flat and strange, like a blueprint drawn by
a god who had not yet decided how many rooms the building would need.

And then he was back in his chair, gasping, his heart performing a
rhythm that no cardiologist would have endorsed, and the office was
an office again, and the pigeons were still negotiating, and
everything was exactly as it had been except that Adrian Carre now
knew, with the absolute certainty of direct experience, that the
world was a surface.

A surface. A skin. A boundary condition. Three-dimensional reality
was the face of something with depth, and the depth went in a
direction he had just traveled and could not name and desperately,
already, wanted to travel again.

                              * * *

He told no one. This was not, perhaps, unusual for a theoretical
physicist in possession of a result so extraordinary as to be
career-ending if announced prematurely, or indeed at all. The
history of physics is littered with the reputations of men who spoke
too soon about things too strange. But Carre's silence had a
different quality. It was not the strategic silence of a man waiting
for confirmation. It was the hoarding silence of an addict who has
discovered a supply and does not wish to share.

He folded himself again that evening, in his apartment on the Rue
des Ecoles — a small, elegant space furnished with the particular
spareness that is available only to those who have either very much
money or very little furniture, and Carre had the latter. He sat on
the edge of his bed and held the transformation in his mind and
stepped, if stepped is the word, through the fold.

This time he was ready for it, and he kept his eyes open, and what
he saw —

How does one describe a color for which there is no name? A direction
that has no relationship to up, down, left, right, forward, or back?
An angle that subtends no arc in three-space but encloses, in its
own dimensionality, volumes that would dwarf the observable universe?

St. Augustine, writing about time, said: I know what it is if no one
asks me, but if I wish to explain it to one who asks, I do not know.
Carre, writing in the eleventh notebook (his handwriting deteriorating,
as though the hand that held the pen were no longer entirely committed
to the plane of the page), said something similar but less elegant:
"The problem is not that I cannot describe what I see. The problem
is that description is a three-dimensional act, and I am trying to
use it for something that exceeds its specifications."

What can be said, from the outside, observing the effects rather than
the experience:

Each time Carre folded himself through the higher dimension, he saw
more. The first fold had shown him the interior of walls, the
cross-section of a courtyard. The second fold showed him Paris from
a perspective that was not aerial but hypergeometric — the city as
a slice through something larger, its streets and buildings and
rivers revealed as the two-dimensional shadows of structures that
extended in the folded direction with a complexity that made the
visible city look like a sketch, a preliminary draft, the artist's
first tentative lines on a canvas that would eventually contain
something unimaginable.

The third fold showed him people.

Not their surfaces — not the skin and clothing and expression that
constituted a person as seen from three-space. He saw them from the
inside. Not metaphorically — not their feelings, not their thoughts,
but their literal interior geometries: the architecture of organs,
the lattice of bone, the electrical topology of nervous systems
firing in patterns as intricate and as beautiful as the branching of
winter trees.

He saw a woman on the street below his window, walking her dog, and
he saw simultaneously her skeleton and her circulatory system and the
folded convolutions of her brain and the way her cells divided and
the way her proteins folded (folded! even at the molecular level, the
universe was obsessed with folding) and the quantum states of the
atoms that comprised her, each one a probability cloud, each cloud
a smear of potential across the surface of a deeper geometry, and
the woman was beautiful, was terrifying, was a cathedral built from
the inside out, and he wept.

He wept because he could not tell her. He wept because language was
a surface phenomenon and what he had seen was depth. He wept because
the woman and her dog turned the corner and were gone, and from
three-space he could not follow them, could not see where the
cathedral went, could not trace the architecture beyond the
intersection of the Rue des Ecoles and the Boulevard Saint-Germain,
which was, from the hypergeometric perspective, an absurd and
arbitrary boundary, a crease in a map that someone had folded wrong.

                              II.

It is necessary to say something about Adrian Carre as he existed in
three dimensions, before the folding, because it is only against this
baseline that the subsequent changes become legible.

He was thirty-four years old. He was slender, dark-haired, with the
kind of face that is described in novels as "angular" and in life as
"sharp" — a face that suggested precision, economy, the elimination
of the unnecessary. He had been born in Lyon to a family of
watchmakers (three generations, the craft passed from hand to hand
like an heirloom that was also a vocation) and he had inherited their
patience, their attention to small mechanisms, and their conviction
that beauty and precision were not different things but the same thing
viewed from different angles.

He dressed well — not ostentatiously, but with the quiet care of a
man who believed that surfaces mattered because they were what other
people could see. He wore dark suits and narrow ties and shoes that
he polished every Sunday, a ritual he had learned from his
grandfather and maintained with the same devotion others brought to
prayer. He owned one painting — a small abstract by a friend, blues
and greys, a geometry of mood — and he had hung it opposite his bed
so that it was the first thing he saw each morning and the last
thing he saw each night, a visual prayer of his own.

He had friends, though not many. He had a woman he loved — Marguerite,
a cellist with the Orchestre de Paris — and she loved him, or loved
the version of him that existed in three-space, the version that
could sit across a table in a cafe on the Rue Mouffetard and talk
about music and mathematics and the particular quality of the light
in Paris in October. She loved the man who polished his shoes on
Sundays. She loved the man who attended her concerts and closed his
eyes during the slow movements and whose face, in those moments,
lost its angles and became something softer, something vulnerable,
something that the architecture of his features normally concealed.

She did not know about the folding. She noticed, as November became
December and December became January, that he was changing, but the
changes were subtle enough to be attributed to the ordinary
fluctuations of temperament that anyone who lives with a theoretical
physicist learns to weather. He was distracted. He was less present.
He looked at her sometimes with an expression she could not read —
not love, not distance, but something more complicated, as though he
were seeing her from an angle that revealed aspects of her she had
not known she possessed, and was mourning the fact that she could
not see them herself.

"Adrian," she said one evening, in the apartment, after a concert.
She was still in her black dress. He was sitting in the chair by the
window, looking out at the city with an expression of such complex
and unreadable longing that it frightened her. "Where are you?"

"Here," he said. But the word sounded uncertain, as though "here" had
become a more ambiguous location than it used to be.

"You're not here. You're somewhere I can't follow."

He looked at her, and for a moment — she would remember this later,
would turn it over in her mind the way he turned equations over in
his — for a moment, she saw in his eyes something vast. Not
metaphorically vast. Geometrically vast. As though the space behind
his eyes had been extended in a direction she could not perceive,
and what she was seeing through the aperture of his pupils was not
the interior of a human skull but the entrance to something that
went on and on and on in a direction that was neither up nor down
nor forward nor back but —

She blinked, and it was gone, and he was Adrian again, sharp-faced,
dark-suited, present in three dimensions like everyone else.

"I'm here," he said again, and this time it sounded like an apology.

                              III.

The folds became more frequent. Also more extensive. Also more
addictive — though "addictive" was a word that Carre resisted,
because addiction implied a relationship between a substance and a
weakness, and what he was experiencing was, he told himself, not a
weakness but a capacity. A capacity that had been latent in the
human form all along, waiting for someone to derive the mathematics
that would activate it, the way a radio waits for someone to find
the right frequency.

By February, he was folding himself three or four times a day.
The folds were longer now — lasting minutes rather than instants,
though the distinction between minutes and instants was becoming
less clear, time being yet another phenomenon that behaved
differently when viewed from the hypergeometric perspective. He
discovered that with practice, he could sustain the folded state
and move within it — not walk, exactly, but translate himself
through the higher dimension, experiencing the three-dimensional
world as a surface he skimmed along, the way a needle skims the
surface of a record, reading the grooves.

What he read was unbearable in its beauty. The world, seen from
the folded perspective, was not the solid, opaque, divided place
that three-dimensional perception presented. It was translucent.
It was connected. The walls between rooms, between buildings,
between people — the walls were thin, were membranes, were surfaces
that separated only if you agreed to the convention that surfaces
were barriers rather than interfaces. From the folded perspective,
a wall was not a thing that kept you out but a thing that you
could see through, the way you can see through the surface of
water to the stones beneath.

He saw the students in the lecture hall below his office, and they
were beautiful — not in the aesthetic sense, not in the way that
youth is beautiful, but in the mathematical sense, the way a
proof is beautiful: their nervous systems were networks of
astonishing complexity, their cellular architectures were
cathedrals in miniature, their very atoms were dances of
probability that resolved, moment by moment, into the illusion
of solidity. He wanted to tell them. He wanted to say: you are
not what you think you are. You are not your surfaces. You are
geometries of extraordinary depth, and the depth goes in a
direction you have never looked.

He did not tell them. He went back to his office and sat in the
chair and stared at the wall — the wall that he knew was thin,
was permeable, was a convention — and felt the gap between what
he could see and what he could say widening into something that
resembled, more and more, a wound.

                              * * *

The first sign of damage — if damage is the word, and Carre would
have disputed the word, would have argued that what was happening was
not subtraction but addition, not loss but gain of a kind that looked
like loss only from the limited perspective of three-space — the
first sign was that he began to have difficulty with surfaces.

Specifically: he began to have difficulty seeing them as real.

He would look at a table and see, simultaneously, the table as it
appeared in three dimensions (wooden, rectangular, solid) and the
table as it appeared from the folded perspective (a cross-section
of a more complex object, its wood grain extending in the hidden
direction like the rings of a tree that grew in a dimension no
forest had ever known), and the two perceptions would overlay each
other, and neither would entirely resolve, and he would stand in
his kitchen staring at the table for minutes at a time, unable to
decide which version was real, or whether the question of which
version was real was itself a three-dimensional question that ceased
to be meaningful at higher resolutions.

He dropped things. Not because his hands were clumsy but because
he was no longer certain where the surface of an object ended and
the folded dimension began, and he would reach for a cup and his
hand would pass through the space where the cup appeared to be
and close on nothing, because the cup — from the perspective he
was increasingly unable to suppress — was not where his three-
dimensional eyes said it was. It was where it had always been,
in three-space, but three-space was no longer the only space he
inhabited, and his proprioception was splitting, was forking,
was trying to navigate in four dimensions using a body that had
only three dimensions' worth of nerve endings.

He began to lose weight. Not from illness but from the simple
difficulty of eating, which required a sustained engagement with
three-dimensional reality — the manipulation of cutlery, the
identification of food, the coordination of hand and mouth — that
he found increasingly exhausting. Eating was a surface activity.
It required him to treat the world as solid, as bounded, as
composed of discrete objects that could be identified and
manipulated and consumed. And he was losing his faith in surfaces.

Marguerite noticed. Of course she noticed — she was a musician,
which meant she was trained to detect variations in tone and
timing that others would miss, and the man she loved was becoming
a variation, a dissonance, a note that did not resolve.

"You look transparent," she said one morning, and then corrected
herself: "No, that's not right. You look as though you're
becoming transparent. As though I can almost see through you."

She meant it figuratively. But Carre, hearing her, felt a chill
that had nothing to do with temperature and everything to do with
the possibility that she was, in some way she did not understand,
seeing accurately. That the folding was not only changing how he
perceived the world but how the world perceived him. That he was,
in some literal, physical sense, becoming less present in three
dimensions because he was becoming more present elsewhere.

"I'm fine," he said, which was the most three-dimensional of
lies — a flat, opaque statement designed to seal a surface and
prevent anyone from seeing through it.

She looked at him with the expression of someone who knows she
is being lied to and is deciding whether to challenge the lie or
to wait, and she waited, because she was patient in the way that
cellists are patient, accustomed to holding a note and trusting
that the resolution will come.

It did not come.

                              IV.

March. The spring semester had begun, and Carre was teaching again,
standing before lecture halls full of students and attempting to
explain topology to people who existed, uncomplainingly and without
apparent suffering, in three dimensions. He envied them. He envied
their effortless commitment to surfaces, their unquestioning
acceptance of the world as solid, their ability to look at a wall
and see a wall rather than a membrane between here and somewhere
that no word described.

His lectures became, according to his students, increasingly
brilliant and increasingly incomprehensible — a combination they
attributed to genius, not realizing that what they were witnessing
was a man trying to translate four-dimensional experience into
three-dimensional language and failing, magnificently, the way all
translations of fundamentally untranslatable things fail.

He drew diagrams on the blackboard that his students could not
parse — shapes that seemed to fold in on themselves, geometries
that appeared to extend beyond the surface of the board into some
space behind or beyond it. "This," he would say, tapping the chalk
against a region of the diagram that looked, to his students, like
a meaningless tangle of lines, "this is where we actually live.
Not here" — tapping the neat, conventional diagram beside it —
"but here. The first is a map. The second is the territory."

His students took notes and exchanged glances and decided he was
being metaphorical. He was not being metaphorical. He had lost the
ability to be metaphorical. Metaphor is a three-dimensional
literary device — it works by saying one thing and meaning another,
by maintaining the surface distinction between the said and the
meant. Carre could no longer maintain that distinction. Everything
he said was literal. Every surface he described, he saw through.

His colleague Marcel Duchenne — a solid-state physicist with the
build of a rugby forward and the temperament of a parish priest —
took him for coffee in the faculty lounge and expressed concern.

"You're disappearing, Adrian."

"I'm right here."

"No, you're not. You haven't been right here for months. You're
somewhere else — somewhere behind your eyes, somewhere I can't see.
And it's getting worse. You're thinner. You're not sleeping.
You're giving lectures that sound like they've been translated
from another language."

"They have."

Marcel looked at him. "What language?"

And Carre, for a moment — just a moment — considered telling him
the truth. Considered opening his mouth and saying: Marcel, I have
discovered that the human body can be rotated through a spatial
dimension that we have been ignoring for the entirety of our
evolutionary history, and I have been rotating myself through it
repeatedly for the past four months, and the result is that I can
see the world from a perspective that reveals its three-dimensional
surface to be a thin, almost negligibly thin, boundary condition
on something of immeasurable depth and complexity, and the further
I go into that depth the less I am able to return to the surface,
and I think I am in trouble.

He did not say this. He said: "I'm working on something. It's
consuming."

Marcel, who was kind, did not press. He finished his coffee and
changed the subject to the departmental budget, which was a
three-dimensional problem if ever there was one, and Carre sat
across from him and nodded in the right places and felt the distance
between himself and the world of budgets and coffee and rugby
metaphors widening with every breath.

                              V.

There came a night in April when Carre folded himself and could
not fold back.

He was in his apartment. Marguerite was elsewhere — she had a
concert, Brahms, the second cello sonata, and she had asked him
to come, and he had said he would, and he had intended to, but
the intention had dissolved, as intentions now dissolved, into the
hypergeometric perspective where intentions were visible as
structures rather than as plans, and the structure of the intention
was beautiful but not motivating, because motivation — the
conversion of an intention into an action — required engagement
with three-dimensional cause and effect, and he was losing his
fluency in that language.

He sat on the edge of his bed and held the transformation in his
mind and folded.

And the fold went deeper than it had ever gone.

He was — and here language fails again, and will continue to fail,
because what follows is an attempt to describe an experience that
exceeded the descriptive capacity of any language evolved on any
three-dimensional planet in any three-dimensional universe — he
was beyond the city. Beyond the walls and streets and bodies and
molecules and atoms and quantum states. He was in the substrate.
The deep geometry from which three-dimensional reality was
projected the way a shadow is projected from a solid object.

And the substrate was not empty. It was not the void that the
word "beyond" might suggest. It was full. It was dense with
structure. It was patterned and articulated and organized at a
level of complexity that made the visible universe look like a
child's drawing — a stick figure representing a body of
unimaginable sophistication.

He hung there — if hung is the word for a state of suspension in
a medium that was not air, not space, not anything that had a name —
and he saw the shape of things. The real shape. The shape that
three-dimensional shapes were shadows of. And the real shape was —

Beautiful. The word is inadequate but it is all there is. Beautiful
in the way that mathematics is beautiful: necessarily,
structurally, as a consequence of its own internal logic. The deep
geometry was not decorated with beauty. It was beautiful the way a
proof is beautiful — because everything in it was exactly where it
needed to be, and nothing was wasted, and the whole was both
simpler and more complex than any part, and the parts were
infinite, and the whole was one.

And Carre, suspended in this, understood — in the wordless,
immediate way that understanding happens when you see the thing
itself rather than a representation of the thing — that he could
stay. That the fold could be permanent. That he could release his
attachment to the three-dimensional surface and exist here, in the
deep geometry, as a structure rather than a body, as a pattern
rather than a person, and the experience of being that pattern
would be — was already, in the moments he had spent here — a form
of consciousness so vast and so clear that his ordinary awareness,
his three-dimensional mind with its three-dimensional thoughts and
three-dimensional emotions, seemed by comparison like the
consciousness of a drawing. A flat thing. A thing that did not
know it was flat.

He could stay.

The thought was not seductive. It was not a temptation in the
ordinary sense. It was a fact, presented with the same neutrality
as a mathematical truth: here is a space that is larger, more
complex, more beautiful, and more real than the space you have
been living in. You may remain if you wish.

And he wished. He wished with every part of himself that had
learned to see through surfaces, that had lost its faith in walls,
that had held the transformation in its mind and stepped through
and found, on the other side, something that made the near side
look like a waiting room.

But.

Marguerite was playing Brahms. In a concert hall on the Rue de
Rivoli. The second cello sonata, the slow movement, the passage
where the cello descends into its lowest register and the sound
becomes less a sound than a vibration, a resonance felt in the
sternum, in the bones, in the places where the body knows things
that the mind does not.

She was playing it right now. Her bow was moving across the strings.
Her left hand was shaping the notes with the particular pressure
that was hers and hers alone, the fingerprint of her musicianship,
as distinctive as a face. And she was playing it for him. Not
explicitly — she was a professional, she played for the audience,
for the music, for the discipline of the art — but there was a
place in her playing that was for him, a seat reserved in the
architecture of the sound, and if he was not there to fill it —

He could see her, from the deep geometry. He could see her the way
he could see everything: from the inside, from the outside, from
directions that had no names. He could see the cells of her hands,
the neurons firing in the motor cortex that controlled those hands,
the electrical pattern of her concentration, the biochemistry of
her artistic absorption. She was, from the hypergeometric
perspective, a structure of breathtaking complexity and beauty.

But she was also Marguerite. She was also the woman who drank
coffee with milk in the morning and complained about the cold and
read detective novels in the bathtub and loved him with a love
that was, from any dimensional perspective, real. And the thing
about love, Carre realized — the thing that the deep geometry
could show him but could not replace — was that love was a
surface phenomenon. It happened between people. It happened in the
space where one person ended and another began. It required
boundaries. It required the very surfaces, the very walls, the
very limitations that the folding had taught him to see through.

If he stayed in the deep geometry, he would not love. Not because
the deep geometry lacked the capacity for something analogous to
love, but because love was not analogous. Love was specific. Love
was Marguerite, in a black dress, playing Brahms, in a concert
hall on the Rue de Rivoli, on a Tuesday evening in April, in
three dimensions, on a surface that was thin and fragile and
temporary and real.

He folded himself back.

It was harder than it had ever been. The return required him to
compress himself, to flatten dimensions that had expanded, to
accept the limitations of three-space the way a bird might accept
being put back in a cage. His body ached — not with the pain of
injury but with the pain of contraction, of being a larger thing
pressed into a smaller container. His vision was doubled, tripled,
the three-dimensional world and the hypergeometric world overlapping
like photographs improperly developed, and he had to concentrate —
had to hold on to the surfaces, the walls, the boundaries that
constituted three-dimensional reality — to prevent the overlay from
dissolving entirely.

He got dressed. He found his shoes and polished them, an act of
deliberate, ritualistic engagement with the world of surfaces — the
leather, the brush, the circular motion, the growing shine. He put
on his dark suit. He walked out of the apartment and into the
streets of Paris, which were solid, which were real, which were
beautiful not because of what they concealed but because of what
they were: surfaces, boundaries, the particular and unrepeatable
arrangement of stone and light and human presence that constituted
this city, this evening, this moment in three-dimensional time.

He arrived at the concert hall late. The second sonata had already
begun. He slipped into the hall and stood at the back and listened,
and the music was — the music was three-dimensional. It existed in
time. It had a beginning and a middle and it would have an end. It
was a surface phenomenon, a vibration of air, a pattern of
compression and rarefaction that the ear converted into signal and
the brain converted into meaning, and the meaning was not deep in
the hypergeometric sense. It was deep in the human sense. It was
deep the way a well is deep — not because it extends in every
direction but because it extends in one direction, downward, toward
the water.

Marguerite's eyes were closed. Her face had the expression she
always wore when she played the slow movements — an expression of
such concentrated inwardness that it looked, from the outside, like
absence, like she had gone somewhere else entirely. But she had
not gone somewhere else. She was here. She was here in the way that
only a musician can be here: completely, bodily, every nerve and
muscle engaged in the production of a sound that existed only in
the present moment and would never exist again in exactly this way.

Carre listened. And for the duration of the slow movement — four
minutes, perhaps five, a measure of time that the deep geometry
would have regarded as negligible — he did not see through anything.
He did not perceive the interior geometries of the musicians or
the hypergeometric extensions of the concert hall or the quantum
substrates of the strings. He saw surfaces. He saw a woman playing
a cello. He heard music.

It was enough.

It was — and he knew this with the clarity of someone who has seen
the alternative, who has stood in the deep geometry and been offered
everything and chosen this — it was not enough. It would never be
enough. He would always know that there was more, that the surfaces
concealed depths, that the world was thin. He would always feel the
pull. He would always carry the hypergeometric perspective like a
second sight, overlaying the ordinary world with its translucent,
terrible beauty.

But he was here. In three dimensions. Listening to Brahms. And the
woman he loved was playing, and her eyes were closed, and the music
was going somewhere, and he did not need to see through it to know
that it was real.

                              VI.

The concert ended. The audience applauded. Marguerite took her bow
with the particular combination of grace and relief that is unique
to performers, and then she looked out into the audience with the
unfocused gaze of someone emerging from deep concentration, and
she saw him.

Her face changed. Not dramatically — she was a professional, she
did not break character on stage — but he saw it, the small shift,
the recognition, the relief. She had not expected him to come.
She had, he understood, been preparing herself for his absence
the way one prepares for weather: by accepting it as something
outside one's control.

He waited for her in the lobby. She came out in her concert dress,
carrying her cello case, and she looked at him, and he looked at
her, and there was a moment when the distance between them —
the distance that was not physical but dimensional, the gap between
what he could see and what she could see, between the world he
inhabited and the world she inhabited — was palpable, was present
in the space between their bodies like a wall made of glass.

"You came," she said.

"I came back," he said, which was not the same thing but was more
accurate.

She studied his face. "You look — different tonight. Less
transparent."

"I'm trying."

"Trying to what?"

"To be here. To stay on the surface."

She put down the cello case and took his hands. Her hands were
warm from playing — the particular warmth of hands that have been
engaged in precise, sustained physical work, a warmth that was
not only temperature but vitality, the residual energy of art.

"Adrian," she said. "I don't know where you go. I don't know what
you see when you get that look in your eyes. And I don't need to
know. But I need you to come back. Every time. I need you to
come back."

He held her hands. He felt their surfaces — the calluses on her
fingertips, the smooth backs, the small bones beneath the skin.
He felt, beneath the surfaces, the deeper architecture — the
tendons and nerves and capillaries and the cellular machinery that
maintained them. He could not help seeing it. He would never be
able to help seeing it.

But he could choose which thing to attend to. He could choose,
moment by moment, to attend to the surface — to the warmth of
her hands, to the fact of her presence, to the sound of her voice
speaking his name in three dimensions.

"I'll come back," he said. "I'll always come back."

It was not a promise he was certain he could keep. The deep
geometry was still there, still pulling, still offering its
terrible, beautiful expansion. He would fold again — he knew
himself well enough to know that. He would step through the
surface and into the depth and see the world from the
perspective that made the world look flat. And each time, the
return would be harder, the surfaces less convincing, the cage
more constraining.

But each time, he would think of this: Marguerite's hands, warm
from playing. The lobby of a concert hall. Three dimensions. A
surface, thin and fragile and temporary and real.

And he would fold himself back.

                              * * *

In his office, the next morning, he opened the eleventh notebook
and wrote a final entry.

"I have proven that the human body can be folded through higher
spatial dimensions. I have experienced the deep geometry firsthand.
I can confirm that it is real, that it is beautiful, that it is
more vast and more complex than three-dimensional reality by orders
of magnitude that I cannot express in three-dimensional mathematics.

I am not going to publish this proof. I am going to tear out the
relevant pages and burn them.

Not because the proof is wrong. It is correct. Not because the
experience is dangerous, though it is dangerous in ways that I am
only beginning to understand. I am going to destroy the proof
because the deep geometry, for all its beauty, is a place without
surfaces. And I have come to believe — against all mathematical
evidence, against the testimony of my own expanded perception —
that surfaces are where we live. Not because they are all there
is. Because they are where we find each other.

A folded man is a man who can see through walls. An unfolded man is
a man who can knock on doors.

I choose doors."

He tore the pages from the notebook — eleven pages, dense with
transformations, the most extraordinary mathematical derivation
of the century — and held them over the wastebasket. His hands
trembled. The mathematics was beautiful. It was true. It was a
door to something that would have changed the human understanding
of reality more profoundly than any discovery in the history of
science.

He burned the pages. The mathematics curled and blackened and was
gone, and the smoke rose in three dimensions, moving in three-
dimensional air, and it was enough.

Outside, the pigeons were negotiating. He could hear them, and he
could hear, faintly, from an open window down the street, someone
practicing the cello.

He closed the notebook and put it in the drawer and went to find
Marguerite, who was somewhere in this city, on this surface, in
these three dimensions, waiting — as she always waited, as she
had always waited — for him to come back.

And he went.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                SEVEN MASKS FOR THE END OF THE WORLD

                           by Zara Nix

================================================================================


I. THE ASTRONOMER

                    57 minutes remaining.


She had always believed that knowing would be different from not
knowing. That the possession of data — the orbital parameters, the
mass in kilotons, the velocity vector plotted against the thin blue
curve of the atmosphere — would constitute a kind of armor. That
understanding the mechanics of your own extinction would make the
extinction itself

                                                less.

It did not.

Dr. Sable Orrin stood in the observatory dome and watched the
monitors and did not feel armored. She felt transparent. She felt as
though the knowledge had passed through her the way light passes
through glass — altering nothing, protecting nothing, simply
making visible what was behind.

Behind her: the colony. Twelve thousand people. Meridian Station,
fourth world of Tau Ceti, a name that would mean nothing in fifty-
seven minutes because there would be no one to speak it and
nothing to speak it about.

On the central monitor: the asteroid. Designation TC-4417. Mass:
approximately nine billion metric tons. Velocity: sixty-one
kilometers per second. Impact: the northern plateau, thirty
kilometers from the settlement perimeter. The kinetic energy upon
impact would exceed the combined nuclear arsenals of Earth in the
century before spaceflight. There would be no crater. There would
be no plateau. There would be, briefly, a column of superheated
plasma reaching to the edge of the atmosphere, and then there
would be nothing, and then there would be nothing, and then there
would be nothing for a very long time.

She had known for six hours. She and her team had confirmed the
trajectory at 14:00 local time, had exhausted the possibility of
error by 14:47, had notified the colonial administration by 15:12.
The administration had broadcast the alert at 15:30.

The colony had been awake and aware for three and a half hours.

Sable looked at the data on the screen and thought: I spent my
life learning to read the sky, and the sky has written a sentence,
and the sentence is

                                            one word long.


She turned off the monitors. There was no reason to watch. The
mathematics was complete. She walked out of the observatory and
into the evening air, which was cool and smelled of the planet's
native vegetation — a sharp, resinous scent, like juniper, like
something preserved. The sky was clear. The asteroid was not yet
visible to the naked eye. It would become visible in approximately
twenty minutes, a new star, growing brighter, growing larger,
growing

She sat down on the steps of the observatory and looked at the
sky the way she had looked at it when she was eleven years old on
Earth, lying on the roof of her parents' house in Nairobi, not
knowing the names of anything, not possessing the data, not
understanding the mechanics, simply looking up at the ancient
scattered light and feeling


                                            wonder.

She felt it again now. The same wonder. Undamaged. Unprepared.
The sky was the sky was the sky.

She sat on the steps and looked up and waited.



II. THE CHILD

                    49 minutes remaining.


Tomás was seven.

He did not understand what was happening. He understood that the
adults were afraid, which was new, because adults were not
supposed to be afraid — adults were the ones who made the fear
stop — and he understood that something was coming from the sky,
which was where interesting things came from (ships, weather,
stars that his teacher Mx. Alder made him learn the names of),
and he understood that his mother was holding him very tightly,
which she did sometimes but not usually this tightly, and her
hands were shaking.

"Mama," he said.

"I'm here," she said.

"Is the thing from the sky going to hurt us?"

She was quiet. He could feel her chest moving, the breathing
that was not normal breathing but the kind of breathing that
meant she was trying to make her voice work right.

"The thing from the sky is going to change everything," she
said. "Very fast. And I want you to know that I am here, and I
am holding you, and that is real."

"Am I going to school tomorrow?"

She laughed. It was a broken sound, like a plate dropped on a
tile floor, but it was a laugh. "No," she said. "No school
tomorrow."

"Okay," he said. He was quiet for a moment. Then: "Mama, can I
have some of the chocolate?"

She laughed again, and this time it was better, less broken, or
broken in a way that was also something else. "Yes," she said.
"You can have all of the chocolate."

She carried him to the kitchen. The apartment was small and warm
and full of the things that were his world: the blue rug, the
shelf of books with the cracked spine on the middle one, the
drawing he had made of a ship that looked like a fish that he
had pinned to the wall above the sofa. His mother found the
chocolate — the good chocolate, the dark kind that she kept on
the high shelf and gave him pieces of on Sundays — and she broke
the bar in half and gave him the bigger half and they sat on the
blue rug and ate chocolate and she held him and he told her about
the ship he was going to draw tomorrow, the one that would look
like a whale, not a fish, because whales were bigger, and she
said that sounded like a very good ship, and he said he would put
her on it, and she said she would like that, and his mouth was
full of chocolate and her arms were around him and the rug was
blue and the drawing was on the wall and the world was small and
warm and full of things.



III. THE GARDENER

                    41 minutes remaining.


Emil's hands were in the soil when the broadcast came, and his
hands were in the soil now, and his hands would be in the soil
at the end.

He was sixty-eight years old. He had been a gardener for fifty
of those years — first on Earth, in the botanical gardens of
Prague, then on the colony ships, tending the hydroponic bays
that fed the passengers during the long transit, and finally
here, on Meridian, in the agricultural domes that he had spent
a decade building from scratch, coaxing Earth crops into alien
soil with the patient, unreasonable stubbornness that was either
his greatest virtue or his most fundamental flaw, depending on
who you asked.

The domes were beautiful. He had planted them with more than food:
there were flowers here, and grasses, and a small stand of birch
trees that served no agricultural purpose whatsoever but that
reminded him of a park in Prague where he had walked as a young
man, before the colony ships, before the stars, before all of it.
He had planted the birches because beauty was a nutrient too,
and a civilization that did not grow beautiful things alongside
useful things was a civilization that would starve in ways that
calories could not fix.

He knelt in the tomato beds — the late-season variety, the ones
with the deep red skins that split at the top when they ripened,
releasing a scent that was so precisely the scent of summer on
Earth that it made people cry — and he worked the soil around
the roots with his fingers, aerating, loosening, performing the
small, precise acts of cultivation that were the vocabulary of
his art.

The tomatoes would not ripen. He knew this. The tomatoes and
the birches and the grasses and the flowers and the domes and
the soil and the planet and everything on it would cease to exist
in approximately forty minutes. The fact that he continued to
tend the garden was not denial and it was not courage and it was
not any of the noble words that people use to describe behavior
they do not understand.

It was this: the soil was warm. His hands knew what to do. The
roots of the tomato plants were alive, at this moment, drawing
water and minerals from the earth, converting sunlight into
sugar, growing — even now, even with forty minutes remaining —
growing, because growth was what living things did, not because
it led somewhere but because it was the thing itself, the verb
that was its own object, the sentence that needed no predicate.

He worked the soil. A beetle crossed his knuckle — one of the
Earth beetles they had introduced for pollination, a small
jeweled thing, green and copper. He watched it walk across his
hand and disappear into the leaves.

He thought: I have had a good life. I have put my hands in the
soil of two worlds. I have grown things.

He continued to grow things.



IV. THE PRIEST

                    33 minutes remaining.


Father Yuri Aldanov, S.J., had spent thirty years preparing for
this conversation, and he was not ready.

The conversation was with God, and it was not going well.

He was in the chapel — a small, plain room in the east wing of
the colony's community center, furnished with wooden benches, a
simple altar, and a crucifix that he had carved himself from
native wood because there had been no room on the colony ship
for liturgical furniture, and a Jesuit, he believed, should be
able to make what he needed from what was at hand.

He was kneeling. His knees hurt. His hands were clasped. His
eyes were closed. And the prayer that he was trying to pray kept
dissolving into

                    questions

that he did not want to ask and could not stop asking.

Why? The obvious one, the child's question, the question that
every theology and every philosophy and every midnight conversation
with doubt had attempted to answer and none had answered
sufficiently, because the question was not a question but a wound,
and wounds do not close because you explain them.

Why this colony? Why these twelve thousand? Why the children — God,
why the children? Tomás, who came to Mass every Sunday and sang
the hymns off-key and asked questions about angels that Father Yuri
could not answer because the questions were better than any answer
he possessed.

Why?

The silence of the chapel pressed against him. God did not answer.
God had never answered — not in words, not in thirty years of
priesthood, not in the quiet hours before dawn when Father Yuri
knelt in whatever chapel he had built in whatever corner of the
universe the Society of Jesus had sent him. God answered in
other ways — in the beauty of the liturgy, in the faces of the
people he served, in the stubborn, irrational persistence of
faith itself, which was not a feeling but a practice, a daily
choice to act as though meaning existed even when meaning could
not be demonstrated.

But now. With thirty-three minutes remaining. The practice felt
                                                        thin.

He opened his eyes and looked at the crucifix — the figure on
the cross, carved from the pale wood of an alien tree, suffering
in a posture that had been the central image of his faith for
as long as he could remember.

"You know what this is like," he said aloud. "You know what it
is to see the end coming and not be spared."

The figure said nothing. It was wood. It was a representation.
But the thing it represented — the historical moment it pointed
toward — was a man dying, afraid, asking why, and receiving no
answer, and choosing, in the absence of an answer, to stay.

Father Yuri closed his eyes again. He did not pray for rescue.
He did not pray for understanding. He prayed the only prayer
that seemed honest:

          I am here. You are here. That is all I know.

The chapel door opened. A woman — Mrs. Okafor, who cleaned the
community center and attended Mass irregularly and had once told
him, with magnificent bluntness, that she was not sure she
believed in God but she believed in the chapel because it was
quiet and the benches were comfortable — Mrs. Okafor came in
and sat down in the back row and clasped her hands and closed
her eyes.

Then a man. Then a family. Then more.

They came in ones and twos and groups, filling the small chapel,
not all of them believers, not all of them churchgoers, but all
of them looking for a place to be, a container for the thing that
was happening, and the chapel was a container, and Father Yuri
was a priest, and the one thing he could do — the only thing he
had ever been able to do — was to be present in the container and
to say: you are not alone. I do not have answers. I have presence.
I have this room. I have these words, which are old and worn and
insufficient and holy.

He stood. He faced them. He began the evening office, the ancient
words falling from his mouth like water, like rain, like something
that had been repeated so many times by so many voices in so many
places that the words themselves had become a kind of shelter —
not from the asteroid, not from death, not from the silence of
God, but from the unbearable solitude of facing the end without
a voice to say: this happened. We were here. It mattered.

                    Dominus vobiscum.
                    Et cum spiritu tuo.

The chapel was full. The words were old. Outside, the sky was
darkening, and somewhere in the dark a new star was growing
brighter.



V. THE LOVERS

                    22 minutes remaining.


They had been arguing about the dishes when the broadcast came.
Three hours and twenty-two minutes later, with twenty-two minutes
remaining, they were still together, which surprised them both,
because the argument about the dishes had been, they both knew,
not about the dishes.

Ren and Cassia. Married four years. Colonists, second wave.
She was an atmospheric chemist. He was a structural engineer.
They had come to Meridian for the work, for the adventure, for
the newness of a world where everything — the air, the soil,
the light — was a problem to be solved, and they were both people
who solved problems, which was why they were good at their jobs
and terrible at their marriage.

"I don't want to spend the last twenty minutes of my life being
angry at you," Cassia said.

"Then don't," Ren said.

"It's not a switch."

"I know it's not a switch."

"Then don't say 'then don't' as if it's a switch."

They were sitting on the floor of their apartment, backs against
the sofa, legs stretched out, not touching. The apartment was a
mess — their apartment was always a mess, and the mess had been
one of the things they argued about, part of the vast, intricate
architecture of grievance and disappointment that constituted the
interior of their marriage, the part that visitors never saw —
and the mess was here, surrounding them, as present and as
permanent as it would ever be, and Cassia looked at the mess and
thought: this is the last mess. No one will ever clean it up.
No one will ever argue about it again.

"I love you," she said. "I want you to know that. I love you
and I have not been good at it and I am sorry."

Ren looked at her. His face was doing the thing it did when he
was trying not to cry, which was the same thing it did when he
was trying not to be angry, which was the same thing it did when
he was trying not to feel anything at all — a tightening, a
closing, as though his face were a door and he were pulling it
shut.

"Don't do that," she said. "Don't close. Not now."

"I'm not closing."

"You are. You're doing the face."

"I don't have a face."

"You have a face and it's closing and I need you to open it
because we have twenty minutes and I can't spend them talking to
a door."

He looked at her. The door opened. What was behind it was not
composed, was not articulate, was not the measured, engineering-
precise expression that he wore like a uniform. What was behind
it was raw and shapeless and afraid.

"I don't want to die," he said.

"I know."

"I don't want to die and I don't want you to die and I don't
know how to do this and I'm angry. I'm angry at the sky and
I'm angry at the colony administration for bringing us here and
I'm angry at the dishes and I'm angry at myself for wasting
time being angry about the dishes when I could have been —"

"What?"

"Here. I could have been here. With you. Actually here, not just
in the same room pretending to be here while actually being
somewhere inside my own head arguing about something that
doesn't —"

He stopped. Cassia took his hand. His hand was shaking. Her hand
was shaking. The two shakings did not cancel each other out; they
multiplied, became a vibration that was shared, a frequency that
belonged to both of them and neither of them, and she thought:
this is what marriage was supposed to be. Not the solved problem.
The shared trembling.

"I love you," he said. "I have loved you badly and I have loved
you well and both of those things are true and I do not know how
to reconcile them and I do not have time to learn."

"We have twenty minutes."

"We have twenty minutes."

"Then let's not waste them."

They did not waste them. They did not solve anything. They did
not forgive each other or reach closure or achieve the kind of
emotional resolution that stories require and life does not
provide. They sat on the floor of their messy apartment and held
each other's shaking hands and talked — not about the important
things, not about the dishes or the marriage or the end of the
world, but about the small things, the things that were too small
for arguments and too large for silence: the way the light looked
in the morning through the kitchen window, the sound of his
breathing when he was asleep, the particular quality of her
laughter when something surprised her, the way the coffee tasted
on the morning they arrived on Meridian and stood outside the
landing module and looked at the sky of a new world and felt,
both of them, at the same moment, without speaking, that they
were exactly where they were supposed to be.

They talked about the small things until the small things filled
the room, filled the minutes, filled the space between them that
the arguments had hollowed out, and when the new star appeared in
the window — bright, growing brighter, brighter than anything,
a light that was not a light but an ending — they were not afraid.

They were not not afraid.

They were together.



VI. THE MUSICIAN

                    9 minutes remaining.


Kael had always believed that music was the closest thing to
time travel that human beings possessed. A melody, once heard,
existed in all the moments of your life simultaneously — the
moment you first heard it, every moment you remembered it,
every moment it played in the background of some other experience,
layering itself into the texture of your days like thread woven
into cloth. Music did not move through time the way people moved
through time, one second after the next. Music was time, folded.

He was sitting in the colony's concert hall — a grand name for
a modest room, a space that doubled as a lecture hall and a town
meeting venue and, on Saturday evenings, a place where a small
ensemble of amateur and semi-professional musicians played for
an audience of whoever felt like listening. The room had good
acoustics, though. Kael had seen to that. He had spent three
months adjusting the wall panels to achieve a reverberation time
that he considered acceptable, which was approximately 1.8
seconds, which was the same as a small European cathedral, which
was, he felt, the minimum standard for a room in which music
was to be played.

He was alone. The rest of the ensemble had gone — to their
families, to their friends, to wherever it was that people went
when the time was short and the choices had narrowed to the
essential. Kael had no family on Meridian. He had friends, but
the friendships were the kind that thrived on regular contact and
shared activity and did not quite survive the pressure of
extremity. He was not lonely. He was a man who had organized
his life around a single devotion, and when the world contracted
to its final minutes, the devotion was what remained.

He picked up his violin.

It was not a valuable instrument — a factory-made copy of a
Guarneri, brought from Earth in a hard case that had survived
the journey better than some of the colonists. But he had played
it for twenty years, and his hands had shaped the sound over
those years into something that was his, distinctly his, the way
a river shapes the stone of its bed into a channel that belongs
to that river and no other.

He played.

He did not play a requiem. He did not play a lament. He played
the third partita of Bach, the prelude, the one that begins with
a cascade of sixteenth notes that tumble over each other like
water over rocks, joyful and precise and unstoppable — music
that is not about anything except the fact of its own existence,
music that celebrates the act of music, that says: here is a
pattern, here is a structure, here is something that the human
mind can make from vibrating strings and the mathematics of
harmony and the miracle of the ear's capacity to convert pressure
waves into meaning.

He played and the sound filled the room and bounced off the
walls he had tuned and came back to him altered, enriched,
carrying the ghost of itself a moment ago, the reverberation
that was the room's memory of the sound, and the sound and its
memory blended, and for nine minutes, in a room with good
acoustics, on a world with nine minutes remaining, there was
music.

The Bach did not know it was the last Bach.

The violin did not know it was the last violin.

The room did not know it was the last room.

Only Kael knew, and he played, and the knowing did not change
the notes. The notes were what they were. They were what they
had always been. They were what Bach had written in a room in
Cothen three centuries and change ago, and they were the same
notes, and they were perfect, and they were indifferent to the
question of whether anyone would ever play them again.

He played until the light in the window changed.

He played until the light in the window changed and then he did
not play anymore and the reverberation held the last note for
1.8 seconds and then



VII. THE RECORD

                    0 minutes remaining.


     The colony's automated data beacon, designed to survive
     impacts up to Class III, transmits the following record
     to the nearest relay station approximately 0.003 seconds
     before the surface temperature exceeds the beacon's
     operational threshold:

     MERIDIAN STATION — FINAL AUTOMATED TRANSMISSION
     Timestamp: [redacted — time reference frame destroyed]
     Population at time of event: 12,247
     Nature of event: Kinetic impact, asteroid TC-4417
     Probability of survivors: 0.000%

     Attached: colony census data; atmospheric and geological
     readings; scientific archives (compressed); personal
     messages (1,847 files, individually addressed, queued for
     relay — see attachment directory).

     Note: Beacon telemetry indicates the following anomalous
     reading in the 0.7 seconds preceding impact. The colony's
     acoustic sensors registered a sustained vibration
     consistent with a single stringed instrument, source:
     community center, Room 4A. Analysis suggests solo violin.

                     MEMORY PALACE OF PHOBOS

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                              I.

The woman sitting across from Cord Massinger's desk had the kind of
face that memory engineers learned to read the way poker players read
tells: too composed. Too still. A face that was working hard to look
like it wasn't working hard.

"I need you to build me a palace," she said.

Massinger leaned back in his chair and studied her. His office was on
the forty-sixth floor of the Hellas Tower in New Cydonia, Mars, and
through the window behind him the city spread out in a grid of
pressurized domes and connecting tubes, lit from within by the warm
amber glow of artificial sunlight. It was late afternoon, Martian
time. The real sun — small and distant, a coin held at arm's length —
was dropping toward the western rim of the basin.

"A memory palace," he said. "That's what I do."

"I know what you do, Mr. Massinger. I've done my research."

"Then you know I'll need to do mine. Building a memory palace means
going into your head. Mapping the architecture. Finding the load-
bearing walls, the closets, the rooms you don't open. It's invasive
work. Most people find it uncomfortable."

"I'm not most people."

"No," he said, looking at her. "I don't suppose you are."

Her name was Vera Ostanova. She was forty-one years old, according to
the intake form she had filled out in the waiting room. Occupation:
independent consultant. That was the polite Martian term for someone
who worked in the grey spaces between the colonial corporations —
a fixer, a broker, a person who made connections that the official
channels could not or would not make. The grey spaces on Mars were
wide, and the people who worked in them tended to be either very
competent or very dead. Vera Ostanova was alive, which told Massinger
something.

"Why do you need a memory palace?" he asked.

"I have a great deal of information that I need to organize and access
reliably. My work requires rapid recall under stressful conditions.
A memory palace is the most efficient mnemonic architecture available.
You build the best ones on Mars."

It was a reasonable answer. It was too reasonable, which meant it was
the answer she had prepared, and the real answer was somewhere behind
it, in one of those rooms she didn't open.

"All right," he said. "We'll start with a preliminary mapping session
tomorrow. Standard contract: I'll need full neural access during the
mapping phase. Everything I see is confidential. My rates are —"

"I know your rates. They're acceptable."

She stood, shook his hand — firm grip, dry palm, no tremor — and left.
Massinger watched her go, then turned to his window and looked out at
the city and thought about the thing that had been wrong about her
face.

It wasn't the composure. People who needed memory palaces were often
composed — they were professionals, executives, intelligence operatives,
people whose work required them to manage information under pressure.
Composure was standard.

It was the eyes. When she'd said "I need you to build me a palace,"
her eyes had done something that the rest of her face hadn't
authorized. They had flickered — a micro-expression, half a second,
less — and the expression was not the cool calculation of a woman
hiring a contractor. It was fear.

Not fear of him. Fear of what he might find.

Massinger poured himself a drink — Martian whiskey, which was terrible
but available — and considered walking away. He had built thirty-seven
memory palaces in his career, and the ones that started with fear in
the client's eyes were the ones that ended badly.

He did not walk away. The rent was due, and the whiskey was almost
gone, and he was a mnemonic engineer on Mars, which meant he was in
no position to turn down work.

He finished the drink and began preparing the neural interface
equipment for the next day's session, and if his hands were slightly
less steady than they should have been, he attributed it to the
whiskey rather than to the premonition that Vera Ostanova was going to
be trouble.

                              * * *

The trouble started at 10:00 AM the next morning, approximately
fourteen seconds into the preliminary mapping session.

The neural interface was standard equipment — a headset that
established a low-bandwidth link between the engineer's cortex and the
client's, allowing the engineer to perceive the client's mnemonic
landscape as a navigable three-dimensional space. It was not
telepathy. It was more like a guided tour of a building: the client's
memories were organized by their brain into spatial structures — rooms,
corridors, landscapes — and the neural interface allowed the engineer
to walk through those structures, observing their architecture,
identifying the strong points and the weak points, the well-organized
areas and the cluttered ones.

Every mind had a different architecture. Some people's memories were
neat and institutional — filing cabinets, libraries, office buildings.
Some were organic — forests, rivers, cave systems. Some were surreal —
Escher staircases, impossible geometries, spaces that folded in on
themselves. The architecture wasn't random; it reflected the way the
person's brain processed and stored information, which in turn
reflected their personality, their history, their cognitive strengths
and weaknesses.

Massinger put on the headset. Vera Ostanova, seated across from him
in the mapping chair, put on hers. He initiated the link.

And immediately knew something was wrong.

The architecture was — he did not have a word for it. He had mapped
thirty-seven minds, and each one had been different, but they had all
been, at base, recognizable. Human minds produced human architectures.
Even the most unusual mnemonic landscapes — the surrealist geometries,
the abstract pattern-spaces — had an underlying logic that was
identifiable as a product of human cognition.

Vera Ostanova's mnemonic landscape was not recognizable.

He was standing — his avatar was standing, the virtual representation
of himself that the neural interface projected into the client's
mnemonic space — in a city. But it was not New Cydonia, and it was
not any city on Earth, and it was not any city he had encountered in
any of his previous mappings. It was a city of red stone, low and
sprawling, with narrow streets and flat-roofed buildings and a quality
of light that was not the amber of Martian artificial sunlight but
something older, dimmer, the light of a world with a thinner
atmosphere and a weaker sun.

It was old Mars. The Mars of the early colony — the frontier Mars, the
pre-corporate Mars, the Mars of the first fifty years of settlement,
before the domes and the towers and the terraforming projects that
had turned the red world into a pale imitation of Earth. Massinger
recognized it from historical archives: the low stone buildings of
the original settlement at Syrtis, the narrow streets designed for
foot traffic and small utility vehicles, the quality of light that
came from unfiltered sunlight through the thin, un-thickened Martian
atmosphere.

But this was not an archive. This was a memory. Someone had lived
here, had walked these streets, had known this city with the intimate,
embodied knowledge that only personal experience produces.

And the someone was not Vera Ostanova. Vera Ostanova was forty-one
years old. Old Mars — the Syrtis settlement in this state of
development — had existed sixty years ago. The person who remembered
this city had been alive in the early days of Martian colonization
and was, almost certainly, dead.

Massinger stood in the street and felt the red dust under his feet
and the thin wind against his face and thought: whose memories are
these?

                              II.

He disconnected the interface and looked at Vera Ostanova. She was
sitting in the mapping chair with her eyes open and her face wearing
that too-composed expression that he now understood was not composure
but containment — the face of a woman holding something inside herself
that was not hers and that she could not explain.

"Those aren't your memories," he said.

She was quiet for a moment. Then: "No."

"Whose are they?"

"I don't know."

"You don't know? You're carrying a full mnemonic architecture from
someone else's life inside your head and you don't know whose it is?"

"That is correct."

Massinger stood up and walked to the window and looked out at New
Cydonia and reminded himself that he was a professional and that
professionals did not raise their voices at clients even when the
clients were carrying dead people's memories in their heads and had
neglected to mention this fact during the intake interview.

"Tell me," he said, keeping his voice level. "Tell me everything."

She told him. It came out flat, factual, in the clipped style of a
woman accustomed to delivering reports rather than confessions.

Six months ago, she had undergone a routine medical procedure at a
clinic in New Cydonia — a neural scan, part of the standard health
monitoring that the colonial administration required of all residents.
Standard procedure. She had done it a dozen times before. But this
time, when she woke up, the memories were there.

Not vague impressions. Not fragments. A complete, detailed,
experiential record of a life she had not lived — the streets of old
Syrtis, the faces of people she had never met, the daily routines of
a person who had lived and worked on Mars decades before Vera Ostanova
was born. The memories had the quality of lived experience: sensory,
emotional, contextualized. They felt real. They felt as real as her
own memories, and in some cases, more real — clearer, more vivid, more
detailed, as though the original owner had possessed an unusually
powerful capacity for mnemonic encoding.

"I've been living with two sets of memories for six months," she said.
"My own and someone else's. The someone else is — was — a woman. I
don't know her name. I know her life. I know her apartment in old
Syrtis. I know the sound of her footsteps on the stone streets. I
know the taste of the coffee she drank every morning from a vendor
on the corner of Bradbury and Nix. I know — "

She stopped. The composure cracked, just for a moment, a fissure in
the smooth facade. "I know how she died," she said. "And I think that's
why I'm here."

Massinger sat back down. The professional in him was cataloguing the
possibilities — neural contamination during the scan, mnemonic data
corruption, a rare neurological syndrome involving false memory
generation. But the part of him that had grown up reading crime novels
in the back alleys of New Cydonia was listening to something else.

"How did she die?" he asked.

"She was murdered," Vera said. "In her apartment. By someone she knew.
Someone she trusted. And I know this because I remember it. I remember
the door opening. I remember the face. I remember the hands."

"Whose face? Whose hands?"

"That's the problem. The memory of the face is — it's damaged. Degraded.
Like a photograph that's been partially erased. I can see the room. I
can feel the hands. I can hear the voice. But the face is —" She made
a gesture, fingers spreading, as if releasing smoke. "Gone. Corrupted.
I've tried to recover it. I've tried every mnemonic technique I know.
The data is there, but it's been altered. Someone erased the face
from the memory before the memory was — however the memory was
transferred to me."

Massinger looked at her for a long time. "You think someone put these
memories in your head deliberately."

"I think someone put these memories in my head because they wanted
someone to find the truth about a murder that happened sixty years
ago and was never investigated. And I think whoever committed the
murder altered the memories before they were transferred, removing
their own identity. Which means I have all the evidence except the one
piece that matters."

"And you came to me because —"

"Because you build memory palaces. You map mnemonic architecture. You
go into the spaces where memories live and you organize them and you
find things that are hidden and you build structures that make them
accessible. I need you to go into these memories — not my memories,
the other memories — and find the face."

Massinger leaned back in his chair and thought about his rent and
his whiskey and his thirty-seven previous clients and the fact that
none of them had ever asked him to solve a sixty-year-old murder by
reconstructing a deliberately damaged memory inside a dead woman's
stolen mnemonic archive.

"My rate," he said, "just doubled."

"Acceptable," she said.

                              III.

He went in the next morning.

The neural interface dropped him into old Syrtis, and he walked the
streets of a dead woman's memory, and the streets were beautiful.

They had the quality that only genuine memories possess — the quality
of being experienced rather than imagined. The light fell at specific
angles. The shadows had the particular darkness of a Mars with no
dome-reflected light, only the raw Martian sun in a raw Martian sky.
The air — or what passed for air, the thin, cold atmosphere that the
early colonists had breathed through masks and regulators — had a
specific texture, a specific temperature, a specific scent of stone
and dust and recycled oxygen.

Massinger walked, and the city built itself around him as he walked,
memories assembling in response to his presence the way dreams
assemble in response to the dreamer's movement — here a building,
here a face, here the vendor on the corner of Bradbury and Nix with
his cart of coffee and his brown apron and his habit of whistling
old Earth songs while he worked the machine.

The dead woman — whoever she was — had loved this city. That was
evident in the quality of the memories. They were warm, detailed,
affectionate. The stone streets were not just surfaces; they were
specific stones, each one known, the way you know the floorboards
of a house you've lived in for decades. The buildings were not just
architecture; they were landmarks in a personal geography — this is
where I bought bread, this is where I argued with the plumber, this
is where I stood one evening and watched the sunset through the thin
atmosphere and thought about home and decided that this was home now.

He followed the memories deeper, moving from the streets into the
buildings, from the public spaces into the private. The dead woman's
apartment was on the third floor of a building on Hoagland Street —
a small, cluttered space full of books and datapads and the particular
domestic chaos of a person who was too busy living to organize. There
was a desk by the window, piled with papers. There was a bed with an
unmade surface. There were photographs on the wall — faces that
Massinger did not recognize, frozen in moments of laughter and
conversation, the visual archaeology of a social life.

And there, in the corner of the apartment, was the memory he was
looking for.

He knew it immediately. It was different from the other memories —
darker, denser, charged with the adrenaline-soaked clarity that
extreme experiences imprint on the brain. It stood out from its
surroundings like a bruise on skin.

He approached it. The memory activated.

He was in the apartment. It was night. The lights were low. The dead
woman — he was seeing through her eyes, experiencing through her
senses — was sitting at her desk, working. There was a sound: the
door opening. The familiar hiss of the pressure seal releasing. She
looked up.

A figure stood in the doorway. Tall. Wearing a dark coat. And where
the face should have been, there was nothing. Not darkness, not a
blur, not any of the visual artifacts that corrupted memories usually
produced. Nothing. A void. A space where information had been
surgically removed, the way a word might be redacted from a
classified document — neatly, precisely, with the intention that
nothing readable would remain.

The figure spoke. The voice was — Massinger concentrated, pushing the
neural interface to its highest resolution — the voice was male.
Deep. Accented. The accent was — he concentrated harder — Slavic.
Eastern European. Russian, possibly, or Czech. The voice said: "You
should not have kept those records, Katya."

Katya. The dead woman's name was Katya.

The figure moved forward. Massinger felt the dead woman's — Katya's —
fear. It was visceral, physical, a contraction of the stomach and a
tightening of the throat and a surge of cortisol that flooded the
mnemonic landscape with the sharp, metallic taste of terror. She
stood up from the desk. She backed away. She said: "Those records
are insurance. If anything happens to me —"

"Nothing is going to happen to you," the voice said, and the voice
was calm, and the hands — gloved, dark, emerging from the sleeves of
the dark coat — reached for her, and the memory ended.

Not faded. Not degraded. Ended. Cut. As cleanly as a film splice.
One moment, the hands reaching; the next, nothing.

Massinger pulled himself out of the neural interface and sat in his
office and breathed and thought about what he had just seen.

A woman named Katya. Murdered in her apartment in old Syrtis, sixty
years ago. She had kept records — of what? Insurance, she had called
them. Records that someone wanted badly enough to kill for. And
someone, decades later, had taken Katya's memories — all of them, the
entire mnemonic archive of a lived life — and placed them inside Vera
Ostanova's head. But not before removing the killer's face from the
crucial memory.

Why? If you wanted the murder solved, why remove the face? If you
didn't want it solved, why transfer the memories at all?

Unless the person who transferred the memories and the person who
removed the face were not the same person. Unless the transfer was
the message, and the redaction was the cover-up, and the two acts
were the work of two different hands.

Massinger poured himself a drink and thought about records and
insurance and a voice with a Slavic accent and the particular
quality of a murder that stayed hidden for sixty years on a planet
where nothing stayed hidden for long.

                              IV.

He started digging.

Not in the memories — in the real world, the paper-and-data world
that existed outside the mnemonic landscape. Old Mars had records.
The early colonial administration had been obsessive about
documentation — a characteristic of frontier governments everywhere,
which compensated for their lack of established institutions by
generating prodigious quantities of paperwork.

Massinger spent two days in the New Cydonia Public Archives, a
windowless building in the administrative district staffed by a
single archivist who was either extremely dedicated or simply unable
to find the exit. He searched the census records for old Syrtis,
looking for a woman named Katya who had lived on Hoagland Street.

He found her on the second day. Katya Mirova. Born on Earth, 1972.
Emigrated to Mars in 1996. Occupation: colonial administration
clerk. Assigned to the Resource Allocation Division at Syrtis.
Deceased: 2004. Cause of death: listed as "accidental decompression —
seal failure in residential unit."

Not murder. An accident. A seal failure. The kind of thing that
happened on early Mars, where the infrastructure was new and the
margins were thin and people died of mechanical failures that better
engineering would have prevented.

Except that Massinger had been inside Katya Mirova's memories, and
what he had seen was not a seal failure. What he had seen was a man
in a dark coat with an erased face and gloved hands, and Katya
backing away from her desk, and the memory ending with the abruptness
of a life interrupted.

He dug deeper. The Resource Allocation Division at Syrtis — what had
they done? Massinger found the records, fragmentary and poorly
digitized but legible. The Division had been responsible for
distributing colony resources — water, power, building materials,
food — among the settlement's residents and businesses. A clerical
job. A bureaucratic job. Not the kind of job that got people killed.

Unless the distribution was not equitable. Unless the records showed
something that someone wanted hidden.

Massinger went back to the archives and pulled the Resource Allocation
Division's files for the years 2000 to 2004, the last four years of
Katya Mirova's life. What he found was a pattern — subtle, well-
concealed, but unmistakable once you knew what to look for. Resources
were being diverted. Water and power allocations meant for the general
population were being redirected to a specific set of commercial
enterprises — mining operations, construction firms, service companies
— all of which were owned, through a web of shell corporations and
nominee shareholders, by the same entity.

A company called Ares Holdings.

Massinger did not recognize the name. But when he searched the
corporate registry and followed the ownership chain through three
layers of subsidiaries and two jurisdictional transfers, he found,
at the end of the chain, a name he recognized.

Viktor Ostanov.

Ostanov. Ostanova.

Vera's father.

                              * * *

He confronted her that evening, in his office. The sun was down. The
city lights were on. Massinger was on his third whiskey, which was
one more than was professional and two fewer than the situation
warranted.

"Your father," he said.

Vera sat in the client's chair with her hands folded and her face
wearing its mask and her eyes doing nothing — no flicker, no fear,
nothing. "Yes," she said.

"Viktor Ostanov. Ares Holdings. He was stealing from the colony —
diverting resources through the allocation system. Katya Mirova was
a clerk in the Resource Allocation Division. She found out. She kept
records — insurance, she called it. And someone killed her and made
it look like a seal failure. And the someone was your father."

"I believe so. Yes."

"And the memories — Katya's memories — they were transferred to you
during your neural scan six months ago. By someone who wanted the
truth to come out. But the face — your father's face — was removed
from the memory. By someone who didn't want the truth to come out.
Two people. Two agendas. The memories are a message from someone who
wanted justice for Katya. The redaction is a cover-up from someone
who wanted to protect your father."

Vera was quiet for a long time. Then she said: "Not my father. My
father died eight years ago. The person who redacted the face was
trying to protect me."

Massinger looked at her. "You?"

"I am Viktor Ostanov's daughter. If the murder is solved — if it
becomes known that my father killed a colonial official to protect
his corporate interests — the consequences fall on me. The corporate
assets, the reputation, the life I've built. All of it collapses."

"So who transferred the memories?"

"I believe it was Dr. Alexei Mirova. Katya's brother. He was a
neural engineer at the same clinic where I had my scan. He retired
six months ago — immediately after my scan. He has not been seen
since."

"And who redacted the face?"

"I don't know. Someone who had access to the mnemonic data. Someone
who knew what Alexei had done and tried to undo it — partially. They
couldn't erase the memories entirely without damaging my neural
architecture. So they removed the most incriminating element: the face.
The identity."

Massinger set down his glass. "But you already knew the identity. You
knew it was your father before you came to me."

"Yes."

"Then what do you need me for?"

She looked at him, and the mask dropped, and what was underneath was
not fear and not composure and not the cool calculation of a woman
managing a crisis. It was grief. Old, deep, complicated grief — the
grief of a daughter who had loved her father and had discovered that
her father was a murderer, and who was carrying, inside her own skull,
the final moments of the woman he had killed.

"I need you," she said, "to build the palace."

"What?"

"The memory palace. The one I originally came to you for. I need you
to build it. I need you to take Katya Mirova's memories — all of
them, the streets and the coffee vendor and the apartment and the
photographs and the desk by the window and the moment of her death —
and I need you to build them into a structure that will survive.
That will be permanent. That will be evidence."

"Evidence."

"I'm going to go to the colonial authorities. I'm going to tell them
what my father did. And I need Katya's memories preserved — not in my
head, where they're vulnerable to degradation, but in a memory palace,
a constructed mnemonic architecture that can be accessed, verified,
and entered into the record. I need her life to be evidence. Not
just her death. Her life."

Massinger looked at her. The whiskey was warm in his stomach and the
city was bright outside his window and he thought about Katya Mirova,
who had lived on Hoagland Street and drank coffee from a vendor on
the corner of Bradbury and Nix and kept records that she called
insurance and died for them.

"I'll build it," he said.

                              V.

He built it.

It took three weeks. He went into Vera Ostanova's head every day and
walked the streets of old Syrtis and mapped every memory — every
stone, every face, every angle of light, every sound and smell and
texture that Katya Mirova had encoded in the living tissue of her
brain and that had somehow survived the decades since her death,
transferred through means that Massinger did not fully understand
into the neural architecture of a woman she had never met.

He built the palace on the foundation of those memories. Not a
literal palace — a memory palace is not a building but a mnemonic
structure, a system of spatial relationships that organizes
information into an architecture that the mind can navigate. But
he built it to look like old Syrtis, because old Syrtis was where
Katya had lived, and the best memory palaces are built from the
materials of the life they contain.

He mapped the streets. He placed the memories at their intersections,
anchoring each one to its location — here the coffee vendor, here
the apartment, here the desk by the window. He built the rooms and
furnished them with the specificity that only genuine memory provides.
He placed the photographs on the walls and the books on the shelves
and the particular quality of light that came through the window on
Hoagland Street at four o'clock in the afternoon.

And at the center of the palace, in the apartment, at the desk, he
placed the murder.

He could not restore the face. The redaction was too clean, too
thorough — whoever had done it was a neural engineer of considerable
skill, and the data was gone. But he could preserve everything else:
the room, the door opening, the dark coat, the gloved hands, the
voice — deep, accented, Slavic — saying "You should not have kept
those records, Katya." He could preserve the fear, the retreat, the
hands reaching. He could preserve the evidence of a life interrupted.

When it was done, he disconnected the interface and sat in his office
and felt the particular exhaustion that comes from spending three
weeks inside another person's memories — an exhaustion that was not
physical but existential, the tiredness of having lived, however
vicariously, a life that was not his own.

Vera Ostanova took the memory palace to the colonial authorities. The
investigation took four months. Viktor Ostanov, deceased eight years,
was posthumously identified as the perpetrator. Katya Mirova's death
was reclassified from accidental decompression to homicide. The
resource diversion scheme was documented, quantified, and entered
into the public record. Ares Holdings' assets were seized. Vera
Ostanova lost everything her father had built.

She came to see Massinger one last time, after it was over. She stood
in his office and looked out at the city — the new city, the domed
and towered and terraformed city that had grown up over the bones of
old Syrtis the way all cities grow up over the bones of their
predecessors.

"Was it worth it?" Massinger asked.

She was quiet for a long time. "Katya Mirova was a clerk," she said.
"She did her job. She found something wrong and she kept records and
she died for it. She was in my head for six months, and I know her.
I know the sound of her footsteps on the stone streets. I know the
way she took her coffee. I know the way she laughed when the vendor
on the corner whistled off-key."

She turned from the window. "Someone murdered her and erased it. They
rewrote the records and called it an accident and went on building
their empire. Sixty years. She was erased for sixty years."

"And now?"

"And now she's a memory palace. She's a structure. She's evidence.
She's real."

She left. Massinger sat in his office and poured himself a whiskey
and looked out at the city and thought about Katya Mirova, who had
lived and died on a planet that was not yet finished being built,
and whose memories had survived sixty years in the dark and had
found, at last, a room with a light on.

The city glittered. The sun — small, distant, persistent — was
setting over the western rim. Somewhere beneath the towers and the
domes, the stones of old Syrtis were still there, buried but not
gone, a foundation that remembered its own shape even when no one
was looking.

Massinger finished his drink, closed his office, and went home
through the Martian evening, walking streets that had been built
on streets that had been built on dust, all the way down to the
bedrock, where the memory of stone was the oldest palace of all.

================================================================================

                       PILGRIM'S REGRESSION

                     by Father Thomas Aquino

================================================================================

                              I.

Brother Marcus sat in the temporal preparation chamber and tried to pray.

The chamber was a small, white room on the thirty-seventh floor of the
Pontifical Institute for Temporal Studies in Rome — a facility that the
Vatican had established in 2214, after the development of retrograde
temporal displacement made it possible to observe (though not alter)
historical events. The Institute's stated mission was "to deepen the
Church's understanding of its own history through direct observation."
Its unstated mission, which everyone understood and no one said aloud,
was to find out whether any of it was true.

Brother Marcus Alden, S.J., age forty-three, was about to embark on
the first leg of a journey backward through two thousand years of
Christianity, and he could not pray.

This was not unusual. Marcus had been having difficulty with prayer for
several years — a difficulty he had discussed at length with his
spiritual director, Father Bonaventure, who had listened with the
attentiveness of a man whose job it was to listen and had said, at the
end, "Perhaps you are praying and do not recognize it. Prayer does not
always feel like prayer. Sometimes it feels like doubt."

Marcus had found this counsel both comforting and insufficient, which
was, he reflected, the nature of most spiritual counsel.

He sat in the white room and closed his eyes and attempted to compose
his mind, and what he found in his mind was not composure but the
question that had driven him to volunteer for this project — the
question he had carried since his ordination twenty years ago, the
question that had grown heavier with each year of ministry, each sermon
preached, each sacrament administered, each moment in which the gap
between what the faith claimed to be and what the institution appeared
to be had widened by another increment.

The question was simple: Was there ever a time when Christians were
simply Christian? When the faith was pure — uncorrupted by politics,
unburdened by institutional machinery, undistorted by the accumulation
of power and dogma and historical compromise? Was there ever a church
that was only a church and not also an empire, a bureaucracy, a
political actor, a human institution with all the failures and
hypocrisies that human institutions entailed?

He believed there must have been. He believed — needed to believe —
that somewhere in the past, before the creeds and the councils and
the schisms and the inquisitions and the concordats and the
bureaucratic accretions of two millennia, there had been something
simpler. Something pure. The original impulse, undiluted. The
wellspring before the river was dammed and channeled and redirected
and polluted and sold.

The retrograde displacement technology would allow him to see it.
To go back, stage by stage, century by century, and observe the
faith at each point in its history, and find the moment — the era,
the community, the practice — where Christianity was what it was
supposed to be.

He opened his eyes. The technician at the control panel — a young
lay woman named Dr. Emi Watanabe, who treated the manipulation of
temporal mechanics with the cheerful competence of a plumber
adjusting a valve — looked at him and said, "Ready, Brother?"

"As I'll ever be," he said, which was not an answer to the question
she had asked but was an honest assessment of his spiritual condition.

"First stop: fifteenth century. Florence, 1494. The period of
Savonarola."

"I know," Marcus said. He had requested this particular itinerary.
He had chosen six stops, working backward: Renaissance Italy,
medieval France, early medieval Ireland, the late Roman Empire,
the ante-Nicene period, and the first century — the apostolic
community itself. Each stop would last approximately seventy-two
hours of subjective time. He would observe. He could not intervene,
could not be seen (the technology rendered him perceptually invisible),
could not alter anything. He was a ghost traveling backward through
his own tradition, looking for the moment when the tradition had been
alive.

Dr. Watanabe engaged the temporal displacement field. The white room
dissolved.

                              II.

Florence, 1494. The bonfire of the vanities.

Marcus stood in the Piazza della Signoria and watched the citizens of
Florence throw their possessions onto a pyre — mirrors, cosmetics,
playing cards, paintings, books of poetry, musical instruments, fine
garments — while Girolamo Savonarola, the Dominican friar who had
seized effective control of the city, preached from a raised platform,
his voice carrying across the square with the penetrating force of a
man who believed, absolutely and without reservation, that he was
doing God's work.

Marcus watched. He had expected — what? He had studied Savonarola,
knew the history: the charismatic friar who had turned Florence into
a theocracy, who had driven out the Medici, who had replaced the
city's culture of art and pleasure with a culture of penitence and
fear. He knew the ending: excommunication, torture, execution. He
knew the moral: fanaticism destroys what it claims to purify.

But standing in the piazza, watching the actual event unfold, Marcus
found that the moral was insufficient. The people throwing their
possessions onto the fire were not coerced. They were fervent. Their
faces were lit with the particular intensity of people who believe
they are participating in something sacred, something larger than
themselves, something that justifies the sacrifice. They were,
unmistakably, experiencing faith.

It was the wrong faith. It was faith weaponized, faith as destruction,
faith as the erasure of beauty in the name of purity. But it was
real. The people in the piazza were not performing a political act
disguised as religion. They were experiencing genuine religious
ecstasy, and the ecstasy was inseparable from the destruction.

Marcus stood in the square and thought: this is not what I'm looking
for. But this is real. And if this is what faith looks like when it
is intense and sincere and wrong, then intensity and sincerity are not
sufficient criteria for the thing I seek.

He watched the paintings burn. He watched a man throw a lute onto
the pyre, and the strings sang as the heat reached them — a brief,
bright, dissonant chord that was, Marcus thought, as close to a
prayer of protest as an inanimate object could produce.

He moved on.

                              * * *

Medieval France, 1208. The Albigensian Crusade.

Marcus stood on a hillside in Languedoc and watched an army
marshaling in the valley below — the army of Simon de Montfort,
assembled at the request of Pope Innocent III to crush the Cathar
heresy in southern France. Twenty thousand soldiers, bearing the
cross on their surcoats, preparing to sack the city of Beziers,
where Catholic and Cathar lived side by side.

He knew what would happen. When de Montfort's soldiers asked the
papal legate, Arnaud Amalric, how they should distinguish the
Catholics from the heretics in the city, Amalric had allegedly
replied: "Kill them all. God will know his own."

Whether or not the words were actually spoken — historians debated
the attribution — the outcome was historical fact. The army sacked
Beziers. Between seven thousand and twenty thousand people were
killed, Catholic and Cathar alike. The churches were not spared.
People who had taken refuge in the cathedral of Saint-Nazaire were
slaughtered at the altar.

Marcus could not watch the sack. The technology would have allowed
it — his temporal invisibility extended through walls and doors —
but he could not. He stood on the hillside and looked at the city
and thought about the men in the valley, the soldiers of Christ,
who would do this thing in the morning, and who would confess it
afterward, and who would be absolved, because the authority that
had sent them was the same authority that absolved them, and the
institution that commanded the killing was the same institution
that administered the sacrament of reconciliation.

He had expected this. He had known that the deeper he went into
Christian history, the more blood he would find. The Crusades, the
Inquisition, the forced conversions, the complicity with empire —
this was not new information. Every educated Catholic knew it. The
Church had apologized, officially and repeatedly, for the sins of
its past. The apologies were sincere, as far as such things could
be sincere when uttered by an institution on behalf of individuals
who had been dead for centuries.

But standing on the hillside, watching the army prepare, Marcus felt
something that the historical record could not convey: proximity.
These men were his coreligionists. They wore his cross. They prayed
his prayers. The institution that had sent them was the institution
to which he belonged, and the faith that motivated them was, in its
essential structure, the faith he practiced.

He could not separate himself from them. He could not say: that was
a different church, a different faith, a different Christianity.
It was the same church. The same faith. The same words, the same
sacraments, the same apostolic succession that ran, like a river,
from the first century to the twenty-third, carrying everything —
the beauty and the blood, the charity and the cruelty, the saints
and the murderers — in the same current.

He moved on, further back, looking for cleaner water.

                              III.

Early medieval Ireland, circa 620. The monastery of Clonmacnoise.

And here, for a moment, Marcus thought he had found it.

The monastery sat on the banks of the Shannon, a cluster of stone
buildings and round towers surrounded by farmland and bog, and it
was beautiful in the way that places of genuine devotion are
beautiful — not ornate, not grand, but shaped by the daily practice
of people who had organized their entire existence around prayer
and work and the slow, patient labor of preserving knowledge in a
world that was losing it.

The monks of Clonmacnoise rose before dawn and prayed. They worked
in the fields and the scriptorium. They copied manuscripts with a
care and precision that was itself a form of prayer — each letter
drawn with the understanding that the words they preserved were
sacred, and that the act of preservation was a participation in the
divine. They fed travelers. They tended the sick. They lived in
community, sharing meals and labor and worship, subordinating
individual will to collective discipline.

Marcus walked among them — invisible, inaudible, a ghost from the
future — and felt his heart lift. This, he thought. This is what I
was looking for. The simplicity. The devotion. The absence of
political machinery, of institutional corruption, of the gap between
profession and practice that had driven him backward through time.

He stayed for two days, following the rhythm of the monastic hours,
standing in the chapel during the night office and feeling the
beauty of voices raised in the dark — the psalms, the ancient Hebrew
poetry translated into Latin, sung by Irish monks in a stone building
on the edge of the known world, a chain of words linking this moment
to every other moment in which these words had been spoken, forward
and back, a continuity that transcended the failures of the
institution that carried it.

And then, on the third day, he noticed something.

The abbot, Father Colm, was a good man — devout, learned, genuinely
kind. But Marcus, observing more carefully, noticed the way the abbot
spoke to the monk who managed the monastery's lands — a conversation
about boundaries, about a dispute with a neighboring lord, about the
monastery's legal rights to certain fields. The conversation was
political. The abbot was not simply a spiritual leader; he was a
landlord, a negotiator, a man who managed property and people and
who navigated the power dynamics of seventh-century Ireland with a
pragmatism that was, Marcus recognized, indistinguishable from the
pragmatism of any other institutional leader in any other century.

He noticed, too, the hierarchy. The monks were not equal. There were
gradations of status, of influence, of access. The scriptorium monks
held higher prestige than the farm monks. The monk who served as the
abbot's secretary wielded subtle but significant power. There were
alliances and resentments, the inevitable friction of people living
in close quarters under a shared rule.

And there was a moment — a small moment, easily missed — when Marcus
observed a young monk being disciplined for a minor infraction of
the rule. The discipline was not harsh by seventh-century standards.
But the expression on the young monk's face — the humiliation, the
anger, the helpless submission to an authority that demanded obedience
as the price of belonging — was a face that Marcus had seen in every
century, in every institution, in every community that organized
itself around an ideal and discovered that the ideal, once
institutionalized, became a mechanism of power.

It was there. Even here. Even in this beautiful, devoted, prayerful
community on the banks of the Shannon. The politics. The hierarchy.
The gap between the ideal and the human reality. Smaller than in
fifteenth-century Florence, smaller than in thirteenth-century
Languedoc, but present. Inescapable.

Marcus stood in the monastery garden and watched the sun set over the
bog and thought: it is not here either. The pure thing. The original
thing. It is never here, because here is always a human place, and
human places are always political, always compromised, always both
beautiful and broken.

He moved on.

                              IV.

The late Roman Empire, 380. The aftermath of the Edict of Thessalonica.

Emperor Theodosius had just made Nicene Christianity the official
state religion of the Roman Empire, and Marcus stood in the streets
of Constantinople and watched Christianity become, before his eyes,
a department of the state.

Bishops who had been persecuted were now persecutors. Pagan temples
were being closed, their properties confiscated. Heretics — which
now meant anyone who disagreed with the Nicene formulation of the
faith — were subject to civil penalties. The church that had spent
three centuries as a persecuted minority had, in the space of a
generation, become a persecuting majority, and the speed of the
transformation was breathtaking.

Marcus watched a bishop — resplendent in vestments that would have
been unimaginable a century earlier, attended by a retinue that
would have been appropriate for a senator — process through the
streets to a church that had been, until recently, a temple of
Artemis. The bishop's face was serene. He was not a bad man — Marcus
could see that. He was a man who believed that the faith had triumphed,
that the long night of persecution was over, that the marriage of
church and state was a gift from God, a vindication of three centuries
of suffering.

He could not see what Marcus could see: that the marriage was a
transaction, and that the price of the faith's triumph was the faith
itself, or at least the version of the faith that had survived the
persecution — the version that was built on powerlessness, on
solidarity with the poor, on the refusal to accommodate the empire.
That version was dying, right now, in this street, being replaced by
a version that accommodated the empire so thoroughly that it became
the empire, and the empire's sins became the church's sins, and the
church's God became the empire's God, and the story that had begun
with a man dying on a cross at the hands of the state became a story
about the state wielding the cross as a weapon.

Marcus watched, and grieved, and moved on.

                              * * *

The ante-Nicene period, circa 240. The city of Carthage. The
community of Cyprian.

Closer now. Before the emperors. Before the state religion. Before
the creeds had been formulated and the councils had defined and the
boundaries had been drawn. This should have been closer to the
source. Purer. Less corrupted.

It was not.

Cyprian was the bishop of Carthage, and he was a good bishop — a
convert, a former pagan intellectual, a man who had given away his
wealth and dedicated his life to the service of his community. His
letters, which Marcus had studied in seminary, were models of
pastoral concern and theological seriousness. He was, by any measure,
a faithful man.

But Marcus, standing in the community's meeting place (a private
house, adapted for worship — the age of the basilica had not yet
arrived), watched a dispute unfold that had nothing to do with faith
and everything to do with power. The question was: what should the
community do about the lapsi — the Christians who had renounced
their faith during the recent persecution and now wished to return?
Should they be readmitted? Under what conditions? Who had the
authority to decide?

The debate was fierce, personal, and political. There were factions.
There were alliances. There were people who wanted strict discipline
(because strictness preserved the community's identity) and people
who wanted mercy (because mercy was the faith's central claim) and
people who wanted whatever would increase their own influence within
the community's leadership. The arguments were conducted in the
language of theology, but the dynamics were the dynamics of any human
group negotiating power: who decides, who belongs, who is in and who
is out.

Marcus sat in the back of the room and watched and thought: two
hundred and ten years after the crucifixion, and it is already here.
The politics. The factions. The institutional machinery. The gap.

Was there ever a time when it was not here?

He moved on, one last time, to the beginning.

                              V.

Jerusalem. Approximately 55 AD. The community of James.

The earliest Christian community. The people who had known him — not
the theological Christ, not the creedal Christ, not the Christ of
the councils and the catechisms, but the man. Jesus of Nazareth.
Some of them had walked with him. Some of them had eaten with him.
Some of them had watched him die.

If the pure thing existed anywhere, it was here.

Marcus stood in a room — a small room, an upper room, in a house in
the lower city — and watched the community gather for a meal. They
were Jewish. This was the thing that the subsequent history of
Christianity tended to obscure: the earliest Christians were Jews.
They observed the Torah. They attended the Temple. They circumcised
their sons. They did not think of themselves as members of a new
religion; they thought of themselves as Jews who believed that the
Messiah had come.

The room was full. Perhaps thirty people, seated on the floor around
low tables, sharing bread and wine and a meal of fish and vegetables.
James — James the brother of Jesus, called James the Just — presided.
He was a thin, weathered man with the look of an ascetic: worn
clothing, calloused hands, a face that had been shaped by prayer and
fasting into something angular and hard and luminous.

Marcus watched, and waited, and felt — for a moment — the thing he
had been looking for. The simplicity. The intimacy. A community small
enough that everyone knew each other's names, gathered around a table,
sharing food, remembering someone they had loved and lost and believed
they would see again. The words they spoke — the prayers, the
blessings, the fragments of teaching that they passed from mouth to
mouth like shared bread — were not yet creed, not yet dogma, not yet
theology. They were memory. They were the words of people saying:
we knew him. He was here. He said this thing, and it changed us.

And then the dispute began.

It was the dispute that Marcus knew from Paul's letters — the dispute
about Gentile converts. Should non-Jews who wished to join the
community be required to follow the Torah? Should they be circumcised?
Should they observe the dietary laws? The question was not abstract.
There were Gentile converts in the community, and their status was
contested, and the contest was fierce.

James spoke carefully, judiciously, with the measured authority of a
man who was both a community leader and the brother of the person
they all claimed to follow. He proposed a compromise: Gentile converts
would not be required to follow the full Torah, but they would
observe certain minimum requirements — abstention from idol-
polluted food, from sexual immorality, from meat of strangled
animals, from blood.

It was a political solution. A practical solution. A solution that
attempted to balance competing constituencies and preserve community
unity in the face of a disagreement that threatened to tear the
movement apart before it had begun.

Marcus watched the faces around the room. Some were satisfied. Some
were not. There were murmurs, side conversations, the body language
of people who had lost an argument and were already calculating their
next move. The dynamics were the same — identically, recognizably,
heartbreakingly the same — as the dynamics he had observed in every
other century, in every other community, in every other room where
people who shared a faith disagreed about what the faith required.

It was here. At the beginning. In the room. In the presence of people
who had known Jesus personally, who had heard his words from his own
mouth, who had watched him die and believed he had risen — even here,
the politics were present. The factions. The negotiations. The gap
between the ideal and the human reality.

Marcus sat in the corner of the room and pressed his back against
the wall and closed his eyes and felt something inside him break.

Not his faith. Something else. The thing that had been holding his
faith together — the belief that somewhere in the past, there was a
version of Christianity that was not like this. That was pure. That
was uncompromised. That was the thing itself, without the human
accretions.

That thing — that belief — broke, quietly, like a bone that had been
stressed for years and finally gave way, not with a dramatic snap
but with a slow, almost gentle yielding, a recognition that the
bone had been carrying more than it was designed to carry and could
not carry it anymore.

He opened his eyes. The community was still eating. James was still
speaking. The room was warm and full of the smell of bread and fish
and the sound of voices arguing about God.

And Marcus, sitting in the corner of a room in Jerusalem two thousand
one hundred and fifty-nine years before his birth, understood
something that he had spent his entire life resisting:

There was no pure time. There was no uncorrupted era. There was no
golden age of simple faith unpolluted by human weakness. The politics
were there from the beginning, because the faith was, from the
beginning, a human enterprise — undertaken by human beings, in human
communities, with human limitations. The ideal had never existed in
isolation. It had always been entangled with the real, the messy,
the compromised, the political. It had always been carried in clay
vessels that cracked and leaked and sometimes shattered entirely.

This was not a failure of Christianity. It was a feature. The faith
had never claimed to be practiced by angels. It had claimed to be
practiced by people — flawed, political, self-interested, capable
of cruelty and capable of grace, often both at the same time. The
clay vessels were not a deficiency in the design. They were the
design.

He watched James speak, and he watched the people listen and argue
and negotiate, and he felt the broken thing inside him begin, very
slowly, to knit — not into its original shape, because the original
shape had been an illusion, but into a new shape, a shape that
could hold what he now knew.

The faith was real. It was also political. It was divine in its
origin (he believed this still, though the belief had changed its
texture) and human in its execution, and the two things were not
separable, had never been separable, would never be separable,
because the whole point — the entire, radical, scandalous, beautiful
point — was that the divine had chosen to enter the human, fully
and without reservation, and the human was this: messy, political,
compromised, and real.

The incarnation was not a rescue from the human condition. It was an
embrace of the human condition. And if the human condition included
politics and factions and arguments about dietary laws, then the
faith that claimed to take the human condition seriously had to take
those things seriously too — not as corruptions of the faith but as
the medium in which the faith lived.

Marcus sat in the room and felt the tears on his face and did not
wipe them away. He watched the community eat and argue and pray
and eat some more, and he thought: this is it. This is the thing I
was looking for. Not purity. Not the absence of politics. But this:
people, gathered around a table, sharing bread, disagreeing about
God, and staying. Staying at the table. Staying in the argument.
Staying in the community that was never pure and never would be and
that was, despite everything, despite all of it, the place where
the sacred lived.

Not in spite of the mess. In the mess.

                              VI.

The white room again. The temporal preparation chamber. Dr. Watanabe
at the control panel, looking at him with the professional concern of
a technician observing a subject who appeared to have been crying.

"How are you, Brother?" she asked.

Marcus sat in the chair and thought about the question. How was he?
He had traveled two thousand years backward through his own tradition
and had found, at every stop, the thing he had hoped not to find.
He had watched the bonfire of the vanities and the mustering of a
crusade. He had seen a monastery where politics grew in the garden
alongside the herbs. He had watched Christianity become a department
of the state. He had observed the earliest community arguing about
dietary laws while the bread was still warm.

He had found no pure faith. He had found no golden age. He had found
only people — in every century, in every community, in every room —
being human. Being political. Being broken. Being present.

"I'm all right," he said. And he was, more or less. Not the "all
right" of a man who had found what he was looking for, but the "all
right" of a man who had stopped looking for the wrong thing and was
beginning to look for the right thing, which was harder and more
sustaining and did not depend on the past being better than it was.

He went back to his cell at the Jesuit residence and knelt on the
stone floor and prayed.

The prayer came easily, which surprised him. It was not the prayer
he had been trying to pray before the journey — the prayer of a man
seeking certainty, seeking the historical foundation that would
validate his faith and make the doubt go away. It was a different
prayer. A prayer of acceptance. A prayer that said: I do not need
the past to be pure. I do not need the institution to be perfect.
I do not need to find, somewhere in history, a Christianity that is
not also a human enterprise with all the failures that human
enterprises entail.

I need only this: to sit in the room. To stay at the table. To
share the bread that is shared by saints and sinners and politicians
and mystics and ordinary, tired, compromised people who show up, day
after day, century after century, and say the words and break the
bread and try — not always successfully, not always honestly, but
persistently, stubbornly, in the face of every reason to give up —
to love one another.

The faith was not pure. It had never been pure. It was a human thing,
practiced by humans, and it was beautiful the way human things were
beautiful: imperfectly, partially, in flashes and glimpses that
appeared and disappeared and appeared again, like light through
broken clouds.

It was enough.

Brother Marcus knelt on the stone floor of his cell and prayed, and
the prayer was not a request and not a complaint and not a
negotiation. It was a presence. It was the act of a man sitting in
a room, staying at a table, breaking bread with two thousand years
of flawed, faithful, human beings, and saying: I am here. You are
here. Let us continue.

The stone was cold under his knees. The silence was not empty. The
morning light came through the window and fell on his hands, which
were clasped, which were still, which were the hands of a man who
had traveled a very long way to arrive, at last, exactly where he
had always been.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       NO FREQUENCY RESPONSE

                         by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                              I.

I should like to set down, while I am still able to set things down,
while the act of inscription still seems to me a meaningful response
to experience rather than the futile scratching it may well be, an
account of what happened at the Cerulean Deep Array during the months
of September through December of the year in question. I do not
expect to be believed. I no longer believe myself, or rather I believe
myself too well, and belief, I have learned, is a frequency to which
the human mind was never designed to be tuned.

My name is Dr. Elise Carnot. I was, until the events I am about to
describe, a radio astronomer at the Cerulean Deep Array — the largest
radio telescope installation in the outer system, a lattice of nine
hundred and fourteen linked receivers spread across the frozen surface
of Nereid, Neptune's outermost moon. The Array's purpose was to
listen. We listened to the universe — to the background radiation, to
the emissions of pulsars and magnetars and the hot gas spiraling into
black holes, to the faint, redshifted whispers of galaxies so distant
that their light had traveled for eleven billion years to reach our
receivers. We listened, and we recorded, and we analyzed, and we
published papers that were read by other people who listened and
recorded and analyzed and published papers.

It was a good life. I want to be clear about that. I was not unhappy.
I was not the sort of person who seeks out the terrible — the Gothic
protagonist drawn to the forbidden, the Faustian seeker reaching
beyond permitted knowledge. I was a scientist. I was meticulous,
methodical, somewhat shy. I liked data. I liked the clean
satisfaction of signal processing, the reduction of noise to pattern,
the emergence of meaning from the static. I had colleagues I
respected, a small apartment in the station's residential section
with a window that looked out onto the ice, and a cat named Boltzmann
who tolerated my company with the particular condescension that cats
reserve for people who feed them.

I was, in short, an ordinary person, doing ordinary work, in an
extraordinary place. And if the place was extraordinary — if the
black sky above Nereid, empty of atmosphere, thick with stars,
traversed by the vast, pale crescent of Neptune hanging at the
horizon like a bruise on the dark — if this place was, at certain
moments, in certain lights, in the silence between transmissions,
almost unbearably beautiful and almost unbearably lonely, well, that
was part of the job. You learned to carry it. You learned to fill
the silence with work and the loneliness with routine and the
beauty with the comforting abstraction of data, and you got on with
things.

I got on with things for four years. And then, in September, we
received the signal.

                              II.

I must be precise about the signal because precision is the only
defense I have left, the only structure that has not been compromised
by what the signal did to the people around me and what it did not —
or what it did differently — to me.

The signal was received at 03:17 station time on September 14th by
receivers 441 through 463, the southwestern cluster of the Array.
It was not a natural phenomenon. Natural radio sources — pulsars,
quasars, galactic emissions — have characteristic signatures that
any competent radio astronomer can identify: they are broadband or
narrowband, periodic or stochastic, and they conform to the physical
laws governing their production. The signal conformed to no known
physical process. It was structured, but the structure was not the
structure of any natural source.

Nor was it the structure of any technology. We had protocols for
this — SETI protocols, the carefully developed procedures for
evaluating candidate signals of artificial origin. We ran the
protocols. The signal did not match any pattern consistent with
an artificial transmission in any communication paradigm we could
model. It was not a message. It did not encode information in any
scheme we could detect — no binary, no frequency modulation, no
amplitude modulation, no time-division multiplexing, no error-
correcting codes, no mathematical constants, no prime number
sequences, no hydrogen line harmonics.

It was something else.

What it was — and here I am struggling, as I have struggled since
September, to find the words for something that resists words the
way water resists being held in an open hand — what it was, was a
frequency response. Not in the technical sense — not the
characteristic curve of a system's output as a function of input
frequency. In the phenomenological sense. The signal, when processed
through our standard analysis pipeline and converted to audio for
monitoring purposes (a routine step, performed on all received
signals), produced a sound that elicited a response. In the listener.
In the human body. In the human mind.

The response was terror.

Not metaphorical terror. Not the unease of a strange sound in the
dark, the prickle of the uncanny, the intellectual frisson of
contact with the unknown. The signal produced, in every person who
heard it, a physical, neurological, whole-body terror response of a
kind and intensity that I have never experienced before or since and
that I am not confident can be adequately described by a person who
has not experienced it.

Dr. Liam Hase, our lead signal analyst, was the first to hear it.
He was on the night shift, monitoring the receivers, when the signal
came in. He processed it through the standard pipeline. He listened
to the audio output through his headphones.

I found him forty minutes later, in the analysis room, still wearing
the headphones, which were no longer transmitting — the signal had
ceased after eleven minutes and fourteen seconds. Liam was sitting
in his chair, upright, his hands on the desk, his eyes open. He
was not responsive. He was breathing. His heart rate, when I checked,
was 142 beats per minute. His pupils were fully dilated. His skin
was cold and damp. He was, in every physiological respect, a man in
a state of profound, paralyzing fear — the deep, autonomic fear
response that the body deploys in the presence of a predator so far
beyond resistance that the only survival strategy is stillness.
Playing dead. The last resort of prey.

I called for medical assistance. Dr. Hase was taken to the infirmary.
He did not speak for three days. When he finally spoke, what he said
was: "It is aware of us."

He was unable to elaborate. He was unable to return to work. He
was evacuated to the inner system on the next transport, and I
have been told that he remains, as of this writing, in a psychiatric
facility on Ganymede, speaking very little and sleeping with the
lights on.

                              III.

We should have stopped there. I wrote this sentence and then crossed
it out and then wrote it again, because it is both true and
dishonest. We should have stopped, and we did not stop, and the
reasons we did not stop were not reckless or arrogant or Promethean.
They were scientific. We had received a signal of extraordinary
characteristics. We had an obligation — institutional, intellectual,
human — to analyze it. Dr. Hase's reaction was alarming, but it
was also, in a sense, data: the signal had produced a measurable
effect on a human subject, and understanding that effect was part
of understanding the signal.

Dr. Yun-Seo Park, our neurophysiologist, proposed a controlled
exposure experiment. The signal had been recorded. It could be
replayed at reduced amplitude, through speakers rather than
headphones, in a controlled environment with full medical monitoring.
Volunteer subjects would be exposed to the signal under clinical
conditions. Their neurological responses would be measured.

Three people volunteered. Dr. Park herself. Dr. Benoit Curie, our
systems engineer. And Specialist Raya Torsten, our communications
technician.

I did not volunteer. I will be honest about this: I did not
volunteer because I was afraid. Not of the signal — I had not
heard it, had no direct experience of its effects. I was afraid
of the look on Liam Hase's face when I found him in the analysis
room. The empty eyes. The cold skin. The absolute, annihilating
stillness. Whatever Liam had heard through those headphones had
not merely frightened him. It had touched something fundamental,
something structural, something at the foundation of his capacity
to be a person in the world, and it had damaged that foundation,
and I did not want it to damage mine.

I was present as an observer when the controlled exposure was
conducted.

Dr. Park, Dr. Curie, and Specialist Torsten sat in the analysis
room, medical monitors attached, while the signal was replayed
through the room's speakers at forty percent of the original
amplitude for a duration of two minutes.

Within thirty seconds, all three subjects were displaying the
same autonomic response that had been observed in Dr. Hase:
elevated heart rate, dilated pupils, peripheral vasoconstriction,
piloerection, cortisol surge. Within sixty seconds, Specialist
Torsten was weeping — not crying, not sobbing, but weeping in the
old, biblical sense of the word: a total, bodily expression of
grief or terror or something that partook of both and was reducible
to neither, tears flowing down a face that had lost all expression
except the expression of a creature confronting something it was
not designed to confront.

I terminated the playback at ninety seconds.

Dr. Curie recovered first. He was shaking, his hands trembling so
badly that he could not hold the water glass I offered him. "That
isn't a signal," he said. "That isn't information. That's — that's
a feeling. Someone is sending us a feeling."

Dr. Park, who was a neurophysiologist and therefore accustomed to
maintaining clinical detachment in the presence of anomalous neural
phenomena, was less composed. She was sitting with her arms wrapped
around herself, rocking slightly, and her face had the inward
expression of a person who is trying very hard to reconstruct a
cognitive framework that has just been shattered. "The terror is
not a side effect," she said, slowly, as though testing each word
before releasing it. "The terror is the content. The signal is not
a message that happens to produce fear. The signal is fear. It is
the transmission of a subjective state — an emotional state — across
interstellar distances. And the state being transmitted is — is —"

She stopped. She shook her head. She did not finish the sentence.

Specialist Torsten did not recover. She was found the next morning
in her quarters, sitting in the corner with her back against the
wall and her knees drawn up to her chest, and she did not respond
to her name, and she did not respond to touch, and the expression
on her face was the expression of a person who has seen something
that cannot be unseen and has retreated to the only place left —
the inner room, the last chamber, the place where the mind goes
when the world has become uninhabitable.

She was evacuated with Dr. Hase on the next transport. I have not
been informed of her condition.

                              IV.

Dr. Park resigned from the project that evening. She came to my
office — a small, cluttered space on the station's third level,
its window looking out onto the ice field and the black sky —
and she sat across from me and said, "I'm done, Elise."

"I understand."

"I don't think you do. I don't think you can, because you didn't
hear it."

"Tell me what you heard."

She was quiet for a long time. The station hummed around us — the
life support systems, the heating elements, the constant low
vibration of machinery keeping the cold at bay. Outside the window,
Neptune hung at the horizon, its pale blue surface banded with
storms that were each larger than the Earth, and the stars were
thick and still and very far away.

"Terror," she said. "But not our terror. Not human terror. Something
else's terror. Something that is afraid the way we are afraid —
with a body, with a nervous system, with the whole biological
apparatus of fear — but not of the things we are afraid of. Not
of predators or death or pain. Afraid of something else. Something
that I don't have a word for, because human beings have never
encountered the thing that this entity is afraid of, and therefore
we have never needed a word for the fear of it."

"What is it afraid of?"

"That's the worst part." She looked at me, and I saw, in her eyes,
the same thing I had seen in Liam Hase's eyes — not the fear itself
but the aftermath of fear, the landscape left behind by a flood.
"I don't know. The signal transmits the fear but not the object of
the fear. It's like receiving an alarm without knowing what set it
off. The body responds to the fear — the autonomic system doesn't
care about content, it responds to the signal — but the mind can't
contextualize it, can't attach it to a cause, can't build a
narrative around it that would make it manageable. It's raw,
unprocessed terror, without context, without cause, without
resolution. The mind can't file it. Can't metabolize it. Can't
make it into a story."

"And that's what breaks people."

"That's what breaks people. We are narrative creatures, Elise. We
survive our fears by turning them into stories — this is why I'm
afraid, this is what I'm going to do about it, this is how it ends.
The signal gives us the fear without the story. It's fear without
narrative. It's the thing itself, unmediated. And the human mind
is not built to experience the thing itself. We're built to
experience representations. Stories. Maps. Not the territory."

She left the next morning on the same transport as Torsten and
Hase. Dr. Curie, who had recovered his physical composure but not,
I suspected, his interior equilibrium, remained at the station but
refused to enter the analysis room and requested a transfer to a
different facility.

I was left alone with the signal.

                              V.

It came again. Three more times in October, twice in November, once
in December. Each time, the same structure. Each time, the same
duration — eleven minutes, fourteen seconds, exactly. Each time,
the same frequency response: terror.

I listened to it.

I must explain this, because it is the part of the account that I
expect will be most difficult to credit, and it is also the part
that matters most.

After the evacuations, after Dr. Park's departure, after Dr. Curie's
withdrawal, I was the senior scientist at the Cerulean Deep Array,
and I was in possession of a recorded signal of extraterrestrial
origin that had produced severe psychological damage in every person
who had heard it. The responsible course of action — the course of
action that any rational person, any competent administrator, any
human being with a functioning instinct for self-preservation would
have chosen — was to lock the recording, file a report with the
Interplanetary Science Council, and wait for a specialist team to
arrive.

I did not do this. I listened to the signal.

Not because I was brave. Not because I was reckless. Not because I
harbored any secret desire for the terrible. I listened because I
had been present during the controlled exposure and I had felt —
nothing.

I had been in the room. I had heard the signal through the speakers,
at forty percent amplitude, for ninety seconds. I had observed
Dr. Park weeping and Dr. Curie shaking and Specialist Torsten
disappearing into herself, and I had felt — nothing. No terror. No
fear. No autonomic response. My heart rate had remained steady. My
pupils had not dilated. My hands had not trembled.

I had felt nothing, and this frightened me more than the signal
frightened the others, because it meant one of two things. Either I
was stronger than my colleagues — more resilient, more grounded,
more psychologically robust — or I was lacking something. Something
that the signal required in its listener in order to produce its
effect. Some quality of consciousness, some capacity for response,
some essential human thing that Dr. Hase and Dr. Park and Specialist
Torsten all possessed and that I, alone, did not.

I listened to the signal in the analysis room, alone, at full
amplitude, through headphones, for the full eleven minutes and
fourteen seconds.

What I heard was this:

Sound. A complex, structured, non-repeating audio signal that
occupied a frequency range roughly corresponding to the human
auditory spectrum. It was — and I am trying to be as precise as the
language allows — it was not unpleasant. It was not beautiful. It
was not anything that an aesthetic vocabulary could describe. It
was sound. It had structure. The structure was intricate, layered,
suggestive of enormous complexity — the kind of complexity that
one encounters in natural phenomena of great scale, in the sound
of oceans or forests or the aggregate noise of a living city.

It did not produce terror. It did not produce anything. I listened,
and I heard sound, and the sound was interesting, and when it ended,
I took off the headphones and sat in the silence and felt
approximately the way I might have felt after listening to a piece
of unfamiliar music that I respected but did not connect with.

I ran the neurological self-monitoring protocol. My cortisol levels
were normal. My amygdala activation was baseline. My prefrontal
cortex showed the standard patterns of analytical engagement. There
was no fear response.

I was immune.

And I spent the next three months trying to understand why.

                              VI.

The theories I developed were, in retrospect, not theories so much
as confessions — disguised as scientific hypotheses, structured as
research questions, but at their core personal, autobiographical,
the desperate inquiries of a woman trying to understand why she was
different and whether the difference was a strength or a wound.

Theory one: resilience. I was psychologically robust. My emotional
regulation systems were strong, my stress tolerance was high, my
capacity for metacognition allowed me to observe the signal's effect
without being subsumed by it. This was the flattering theory. I did
not believe it.

Theory two: deficit. I lacked the capacity for a certain kind of
emotional response — a capacity that the signal required in order to
produce its effect. The signal transmitted terror, and terror, like
any emotion, required a receiver capable of experiencing it. If the
receiver was damaged — if the receiver lacked the neural architecture,
the developmental history, the experiential foundation that gave
terror its resonance — the signal would pass through without
effect, the way a radio wave passes through a receiver that is not
tuned to its frequency.

This was the theory I feared, because it was the theory that
explained too much. It explained my immunity to the signal. It
also explained other things — things that I had not previously
considered in need of explanation.

It explained why I had been content on Nereid — genuinely content,
not performing contentment — in a posting that most people found
intolerably isolating. It explained why I had never formed the
deep personal attachments that my colleagues formed, the bonds of
friendship and intimacy that made isolation painful. It explained
why I could look at the black sky and the ice and the vast, pale
crescent of Neptune and feel interest, even admiration, but not
the dread, the loneliness, the existential vertigo that others
reported. It explained why I could sit in a room while people
around me were destroyed by something, and feel nothing.

Not feel nothing as in suppressing a response. Feel nothing as
in: nothing to suppress.

Theory three — and this was the one that came to me at three in
the morning, in the dark, in my apartment, with Boltzmann asleep
on my chest and Neptune outside my window and the silence of
Nereid pressing against the station walls like the silence of the
universe pressing against the walls of the skull — theory three
was that there was no deficit and no resilience. There was only
difference. The signal transmitted a specific type of fear — a
type that corresponded to a specific type of consciousness. The
consciousness it corresponded to was the human norm: social,
empathic, connected, terrified of isolation and oblivion and the
void because the human mind was evolved to be terrified of these
things, because these fears were the architecture of social
bonding, the negative image of love — to fear isolation is to
need connection, and to need connection is to be human.

And I was — not this. Not exactly. Not entirely. I was something
adjacent to this. Something that used the same hardware but ran
different software. Something that could function in society, could
perform the rituals of connection, could maintain the surface of
a human life — but that did not, at the deepest level, at the
level where the signal operated, share the architecture that made
the signal's terror transmissible.

I was immune because I was alone. Not circumstantially alone — not
alone on Nereid, not alone in the way that isolation makes a person
alone. Fundamentally alone. Constitutionally alone. Alone the way
a frequency is alone when no receiver is tuned to it.

The signal transmitted the terror of something vast and alien that
was afraid of something it could not name. And the terror was
transmissible to human minds because human minds were built to
receive terror — built to empathize, to mirror, to feel what
others felt. The signal hijacked the empathic architecture.
It used the human capacity for shared emotion as a transmission
medium. And if your empathic architecture was — different. If
your capacity for shared emotion was not absent but altered,
tuned to a different frequency, wired in a way that did not
respond to the signal's specific resonance —

Then you were immune. And you were alone. And the two things
were the same thing.

                              VII.

I have continued to listen to the signal. It comes at irregular
intervals, and I receive it, and I analyze it, and I feel nothing.
I have submitted my reports to the Interplanetary Science Council.
I have recommended that no further human exposure be permitted
without adequate psychological safeguards, a recommendation that
has been accepted.

The station has been partially restaffed. New personnel have arrived.
They are competent and professional and they do not go near the
analysis room when the signal is active. They are, I think, afraid
of me, though they disguise it as respect. They look at me the way
you might look at a person who handles a substance that is lethal
to everyone except, inexplicably, to them. They wonder what I am
made of. They wonder what I lack.

I wonder too.

Boltzmann sleeps on my chest at night, and his small warm weight
is the most human thing I know, though he is not human. Neptune
hangs at the horizon. The stars are thick and still. The signal
comes and goes, a voice from somewhere far away, speaking a
language of fear that I cannot hear, transmitting a terror that I
cannot feel, broadcasting into the void the anguish of something
vast and alone and afraid, and I receive it, and I record it, and
I sit in the silence afterward and try to understand what it means
that the universe is full of fear and I am empty of it.

There is something out there that is afraid. Afraid in a way
that destroys the minds of everyone who hears its fear — everyone
except me. And I do not know whether my immunity is a gift or a
diagnosis. I do not know whether I am the strongest person on
this station or the most damaged. I do not know whether the thing
I lack — the thing that would make me vulnerable to the signal,
that would let the terror in, that would connect me to the vast
and awful empathy that links every other human mind to every other
human mind and, apparently, to whatever is out there screaming in
the dark — I do not know whether the thing I lack is a weakness
or the very thing that makes a person a person.

I know only this: something is afraid. Something far away,
something enormous, something that perceives the universe from a
vantage point I cannot imagine, is broadcasting its terror into
the void, and every human being who hears it breaks, because the
fear is real, because empathy is real, because the connection
between minds — even minds separated by light-years, even minds
that share no biology, no history, no language, no world — the
connection is real, and it is terrible, and it is the most human
thing there is.

And I cannot hear it.

I sit in the analysis room and I put on the headphones and I
listen, and there is only sound.

I am Dr. Elise Carnot. I am a radio astronomer. I am stationed at
the Cerulean Deep Array on Nereid, Neptune's outermost moon. I am
the only person on this station who can listen to the signal
without breaking. I am the only person on this station who is alone
in the way the signal requires you not to be.

The universe is full of fear, and the fear is a kind of connection,
and the connection is a kind of love, and I am outside it.

I am typing this in my apartment. Boltzmann is on my lap. Neptune
is at the window. The signal came today at 14:22 and lasted eleven
minutes and fourteen seconds, and I listened, and I heard sound.

Just sound.

I wonder what the others hear.

I wonder what it would be like to hear it.

I wonder if it would break me.

I wonder if I would mind.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

MIRIAM BLACKWELL is a psychologist turned writer whose fiction
explores the landscapes of the human mind with the same rigor other
writers bring to alien planets. Educated at Barnard and Columbia, she
worked briefly as a clinical therapist before discovering that fiction
allowed her to go deeper. Her first story for these pages, "The Interior
Astronaut" (Issue #50), announced a bold new voice in psychological
science fiction. She lives in Greenwich Village, New York, where she
writes surrounded by books on neuroscience, Jung, and Eastern
philosophy. Of "Interpretation of Storms," she says: "I wanted to write
about a planet where the therapeutic relationship is literally a matter
of weather. And about the political dimensions of grief — who is
allowed to grieve, for how long, and what happens when grief tells a
truth that institutions would prefer to suppress."

JULIAN ST. CROIX is the author of the critically acclaimed novel "The
Hourglass Garden" (Faber & Faber, 1961) and a growing body of science
fiction that has divided readers into passionate admirers and equally
passionate detractors. Born in Cambridge, England, and educated at
King's College, he came to science fiction by way of literary modernism
and has brought with him a prose style of uncommon density and beauty.
"Folded Man" is his second story for this magazine, following "The
Cartography of Absence" (Issue #53). He lives in London and describes
his work as "an attempt to determine whether prose fiction can represent
experiences that exceed the representational capacity of prose fiction.
The answer, of course, is no. But the attempt is the point."

ZARA NIX is an unknown quantity. "Seven Masks for the End of the World"
arrived at our editorial office in a plain envelope postmarked from San
Francisco, accompanied by no cover letter, no biographical information,
and no return address beyond a post office box. We know nothing about
Zara Nix except that they have written one of the most extraordinary
debut stories we have had the privilege of publishing. We wrote to the
post office box to accept the story and to ask for more, and we are
still waiting for a reply. If you are reading this, Zara — whoever you
are — please write to us again.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine and, by his own account, "the most reliable man in science
fiction, which is like being the most punctual man at a carnival."
A former technical writer at General Motors and a veteran of the Battle
of the Bulge, he has published stories in nearly every issue since our
first in January 1953, ranging across every sub-genre with a versatility
that lesser writers envy and critics underrate. "Memory Palace of Phobos"
represents Cain in an uncharacteristically noir mode, and we think it
suits him admirably. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean,
and writes every evening from eight to midnight without exception.

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO, S.J., is an ordained Jesuit priest and professor
of philosophy and theology at Loyola University in Baltimore, who writes
science fiction because he believes it is "a form of theological inquiry
into the extent of God's creation." His stories, including "The Jesuit's
Equation" (Issue #17) and "The Problem of Other Souls" (Issue #36),
are among the most intellectually serious explorations of faith in the
genre. "Pilgrim's Regression" is, by his account, "the most personal
story I have written, and the one that cost me the most. I went looking
for purity and found humanity instead. I am learning to see this as a
gift rather than a disappointment."

LUCIAN MARSH lives in a rented cottage on the Massachusetts coast, where
he writes stories that occupy the unsettling borderland between science
fiction and horror. A Brown University alumnus and former psychiatric
hospital orderly, he has been contributing his particular brand of
atmospheric dread to these pages since 1953, and his work has grown
steadily more disturbing and more beautiful over the years. "No
Frequency Response" is, in our view, among his finest stories — a
meditation on isolation, empathy, and the possibility that the most
terrifying thing in the universe is not the alien but the discovery of
what you are not. When asked for biographical details, Marsh replied,
as he always does: "I live by the sea. I write about the dark. That is
all you need to know."

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling & Ms. Foxworth,

I have just finished reading Issue #50, and I must say that the
direction you are taking this magazine under the new co-editorship is
both exciting and, frankly, alarming. Miriam Blackwell's "The Interior
Astronaut" was a remarkable piece of fiction — I found myself unable to
put it down, and I dreamed about it afterward — but I confess to a
creeping unease about where this "inner space" business is heading. I
have subscribed to "Tales" since the first issue because I love
adventure, discovery, and the promise of the stars. I hope that the
new editorial direction does not mean we are abandoning the stars
entirely in favor of gazing at our own navels, however artistically
the gazing is done.

That said: more Blackwell, please. She is the real thing.

                              — Herbert Calloway
                                 Pasadena, California

Dear Editors,

I write to register my strong approval of the changes underway at
"Tales from the Future and Beyond." For too long, science fiction has
been content to play with rockets and rayguns while the most
interesting frontier of all — the human mind — has been left largely
unexplored. The New Wave writers in Britain are showing what the genre
can become when it takes consciousness, perception, and subjectivity
seriously, and I am delighted to see an American magazine following
suit. Ms. Foxworth's editorial influence is exactly what this magazine
needed.

A specific note: Theodore Cain's contribution to Issue #50,
"Cartographer of Regret," was a pleasant surprise. I had not thought
Cain capable of that level of psychological nuance, and I am happy to
be proven wrong. Even the workhorses can learn new tricks.

Dear Tales,

What happened to the spaceships? I liked the spaceships. I want the
spaceships back. This is supposed to be science fiction, not
psychoanalysis quarterly. I did not pay seventy-five cents to read about
people's feelings.

                              — Frank Kowalski
                                 Scranton, Pennsylvania

Ed. note: Mr. Kowalski, we sympathize more than you might expect. Rest
assured that the spaceships have not been permanently grounded. But we
hope that you will find, in these pages, adventures as thrilling as any
rocket ride — adventures of the mind, which is, after all, the most
complex and surprising piece of technology in the known universe. Give
the inner space a chance. You might discover some unexplored territory
of your own.                                        — M.S. & D.F.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have been reading your magazine since 1953, and I have never before
written a letter to the editor, because I have never before felt
compelled to. But Father Aquino's "Vespers at the Edge" (Issue #48)
moved me to such an extent that I feel I must respond.

I am not a religious man. I abandoned the faith of my childhood forty
years ago, and I have not regretted it. But Father Aquino's story — his
quiet, honest, profoundly respectful engagement with the question of
what it means to believe in something larger than yourself, even when
the evidence is ambiguous and the institution is flawed — that story
made me remember why I once believed, and it made me understand, for
the first time, why some people still do.

More from Father Aquino, please. He is a treasure.

                              — Samuel Kessler
                                 Brooklyn, New York

We are grateful for Mr. Kessler's kind words, and we are pleased to
report that Father Aquino returns in this very issue with "Pilgrim's
Regression," which we believe may be his finest story yet.  — M.S. & D.F.

================================================================================

THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE by Philip K. Dick
(Putnam, 1962, $4.95)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Dick's Hugo-winning novel posits an America in which the Axis powers
won the Second World War, and the former United States is divided between
Japanese and German occupation zones. The premise is alternate history,
but the subject is perception: how do we know what is real? How do
the stories we tell about ourselves — as individuals, as nations — shape
the reality we inhabit? Mr. Dick is interested not in the hardware of
speculative fiction but in the software — the consciousness, the
subjectivity, the vertiginous instability of a reality that turns out
to be as constructed as any novel. The writing is uneven, as Mr. Dick's
writing often is, but the ideas are breathtaking, and the final chapters,
in which the boundaries between the novel's reality and our own begin
to dissolve, are among the most philosophically audacious passages in
the genre's history. Essential reading for anyone interested in the
"inner space" that this issue explores.

A CLOCKWORK ORANGE by Anthony Burgess
(William Heinemann, 1962, $3.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Burgess's slim, savage novel about a young hooligan subjected to
state-sponsored psychological conditioning raises questions that every
reader of this issue should be asking: What is the relationship between
consciousness and freedom? Can a mind be reprogrammed, and if so, at
what cost to the person who inhabits it? The novel's invented slang —
"nadsat," a dizzying blend of Russian and Cockney — forces the reader
to experience the disorientation of inhabiting an alien consciousness,
which is, after all, what the best science fiction has always done. The
violence is brutal and the moral vision uncompromising, but the
questions Mr. Burgess asks are exactly the questions that science fiction
should be asking. Highly recommended, with the caveat that this is not
a comfortable book and is not meant to be.

THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE by Betty Friedan
(W.W. Norton, 1963, $5.95)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

This is not, strictly speaking, a work of science fiction. But I include
it here because Ms. Friedan's landmark study of the "problem that has
no name" — the dissatisfaction and despair of American women confined to
domestic roles that do not engage their full capacities — is, at its
core, a book about consciousness. About the gap between what society
tells you to feel and what you actually feel. About the politics of
inner experience. About the radical act of naming a reality that the
dominant culture has declared does not exist. These are themes that
every writer in this issue is exploring, and every reader of science
fiction — a genre that has always been about the gap between what is
and what could be — should read this book. It will change how you think
about who is allowed to have an interior life, and whose interior life
counts.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #52 — July 1964

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue:

"THE QUIET AFTER CASCADE" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — When a space station
crew detects the death of a nearby star, they must decide whether to
transmit the data to Earth, knowing the information will cause panic.
A meditation on the ethics of knowledge and the responsibilities of
those who possess it. Koslov at his finest.

"THE PROBABILITY GARDEN" by Miriam Blackwell — A botanist on a world
where plant growth is determined by the observer's emotional state
discovers that her garden is growing in patterns that mirror her
repressed memories. Blackwell's second story for these pages, and
every bit as remarkable as her first.

"GENTLEMAN'S AGREEMENT" by Douglas Pemberton — An alien diplomat
arrives on Earth expecting to negotiate a trade treaty and instead
finds himself drawn into an escalating series of social obligations
involving cocktail parties, cricket matches, and a very persistent
duchess. Pemberton's signature comedy, with an unexpectedly moving
conclusion.

"DEEP SALVAGE" by Theodore Cain — A crew recovers a derelict ship from
the outer system and discovers that the cargo is not what the manifest
