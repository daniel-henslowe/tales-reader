TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

This is the war issue.

We did not plan it that way. When we assembled the table of contents for
this number last autumn, we did not know that by the time it reached your
hands, the first American combat troops would be landing on the beaches of
Da Nang. We did not know that the escalation so many feared and so many
others demanded would be underway. We did not know — though perhaps we
should have guessed — that the ancient question of whether violence solves
anything would arrive on every doorstep in America with the morning paper.

But here we are. And here, by coincidence or by the strange gravity that
draws stories toward the questions of their moment, are six tales that
grapple with war in all its forms.

Colonel Stanton — who knows more about combat than anyone else in these
pages, or for that matter in most pages — opens the issue with "The
Pacifist's Arsenal," a story that begins as military science fiction and
ends as something far more unsettling. It is, we believe, the finest work
of his career: a story that neither celebrates nor condemns the military
mind, but instead asks what happens when the tools of war are turned inside
out. Stanton wrote it in three weeks last summer, and when the manuscript
arrived, both of us sat in silence for some time after reading it.

Sanjay Mukherjee, the brilliant Berkeley anthropologist who joined our
pages last year, gives us "Borders" — a story that draws on the legacy of
the Partition of India to explore what happens when a line on a map becomes
a wound in the soul. It is a quiet story, and a devastating one. Franklin
Hoyt, whose political fiction has never been more urgently needed, offers
"Dispatches from a Fabricated Front," a tale of propaganda, journalism, and
the terrifying moment when the lies become indistinguishable from the
truth. Dr. Koslov steps away from his customary hard-science terrain for
"Lullaby for a Dying Star," a meditation on compassion across distances
that cannot be crossed. Theodore Cain, our indispensable man, delivers
"Glass Children," a story about transparency, privacy, and the question of
whether being fully seen is the same as being fully known. And Rex
Drummond — yes, that Rex Drummond — surprises everyone, perhaps including
himself, with "The Mercenary's Garden," a story about a man of violence
who learns to grow things.

Six stories. All of them, in one way or another, about conflict. But not
all conflict is fought with weapons, and not all wars end when the shooting
stops.

We make no apology for the timing. Science fiction has always been the
literature of the present dressed in the costume of the future. If these
stories help you think more clearly about the world outside your window —
or if they simply remind you that the questions we face today are the
oldest questions there are — then we have done our job.

Read carefully. Write to us. Tell us what you think.

The future, as always, is watching.

Yours among the stars,

                              I.

The call came at 0347 on a Tuesday, which told Garrett everything he
needed to know before he picked up the phone. Good news kept business
hours. Bad news came whenever it damn well pleased.

"Garrett." His voice was sand and gravel. Three years of not being woken
by military communications had not softened it.

"Dr. Garrett, this is Colonel Whitfield, United Terran Defense Command.
We need you at Fort Braxton by oh-eight-hundred."

"No."

A pause. Garrett could hear the officer recalibrating. They always
paused when you said no. They weren't trained for it.

"Sir, I understand you've been out of service for—"

"Three years, four months. I left voluntarily. I signed no recall
clause. You cannot compel me. Good night, Colonel."

"Dr. Garrett, the Kessari have crossed the Oort perimeter."

Garrett sat up. The bedsheets pooled around his waist. Through the
window of his cabin in the Vermont woods, starlight lay on the snow like
a cold white bandage on the earth.

"How many ships?" he asked.

"We're still counting."

He closed his eyes. "I'll be there by noon."

He hung up and sat in the dark for a long time, listening to the silence
of the woods. An owl called somewhere in the pines. The furnace ticked
in the basement. These were the sounds of a life he had built
deliberately, board by board, silence by silence, after the thing he had
done on Calydon. The life of a man who had put down his tools and walked
away from the work of destruction.

The phone call had just picked those tools back up.

He dressed in the dark. Flannel shirt, heavy trousers, boots. Not a
uniform. He had burned his uniforms on the day he left UTDC, in a fire
pit behind this cabin, watching the insignia melt and curl.

Martin Garrett, PhD, formerly Chief Weapons Architect for the United
Terran Defense Command. Designer of the Garrett-Chen Kinetic Array, the
Disruption Lance, the Cascade Warhead — each one a more efficient
mechanism for converting living beings into debris. He had been very
good at his job. He had been, by some measures, the best who ever lived.

Then Calydon.

He shoved the thought down. It came back. It always came back, the way
a body floated back to the surface of a lake no matter how many stones
you wired to it.

Calydon. Where his weapons had worked exactly as designed. Where forty
thousand Kessari soldiers had been vaporized in eleven seconds. Where
the kinetic overspill had continued downslope into the refugee camps
that intelligence had sworn were empty, and where — well. Intelligence
had been wrong.

Twenty-two thousand civilians. Kessari civilians, yes. Aliens, yes. But
they'd had children who screamed just like human children, and Garrett
had heard the recordings, and that was when he'd decided to stop.

He locked the cabin. He started the truck. He drove south through the
frozen dark.

                              II.

Fort Braxton sprawled across forty square miles of Utah desert, a
concrete and steel interruption in the red landscape. Garrett had spent
nine years here, in the weapons development laboratories buried three
hundred feet below the surface. Nine years of designing things that
killed.

The guard at the gate checked his identification twice, then a third
time when the computer flagged his clearance as expired.

"Sir, your clearance—"

"Call General Aldous. Tell him Garrett is at the gate."

Eight minutes later, he was waved through with an escort of two armored
vehicles. They took him to Building Seven, the command center, which
looked exactly as he remembered it: a windowless gray block that might
have been a grain warehouse if not for the antenna arrays on the roof
and the armed sentries at every door.

General Hugh Aldous met him in the corridor. Aldous was older now —
they all were — but the general's handshake was still a controlled
demolition, designed to establish dominance before a word was spoken.

"Martin. Thank you for coming."

"Don't thank me. Brief me."

They walked. Aldous talked. The Kessari had come in force this time.
Not a raiding party, not a probe. A full armada. Four hundred twelve
warships, ranging from corvette-class to dreadnoughts, organized in
standard Kessari battle formation — three concentric spheres with
fighter screens between the layers.

"First contact with our picket line was six hours ago," Aldous said.
"They destroyed the picket in fourteen minutes. Our ships didn't even
get targeting solutions."

"How fast are they moving?"

"Point-zero-three C. Decelerating. We estimate main-body arrival at
Earth in nineteen days."

Nineteen days. Garrett did the math automatically, the way a pianist's
fingers found chords even when the pianist would rather not play. Force
ratios. Weapons yields. Defensive positioning. Attrition curves.

"You can't win this conventionally," he said.

"We know that."

"Then why am I here?"

Aldous stopped walking. They stood in a corridor lined with photographs
of weapons tests: fireballs blooming in deserts, in orbit, on the
surfaces of moons. The gallery of Martin Garrett's life's work.

"Because we need a new weapon," Aldous said. "Something the Kessari
haven't seen. Something they can't counter."

"I don't build weapons anymore."

"Martin—"

"I killed twenty-two thousand civilians on Calydon, Hugh. Women.
Children. I heard the recordings."

"And if you don't build this weapon, eight billion human beings will die
instead. The Kessari aren't coming to negotiate. Their last transmission
was three words, repeated: 'Vacate or perish.' That's it. Vacate or
perish." Aldous held his gaze. "So what do you want to do, Martin? Stay
retired?"

Garrett looked at the photographs on the wall. In one of them, he
recognized the white flash of a Cascade Warhead detonating over the
testing ground on Phobos. He had been twenty-nine years old when he
designed that weapon. He had thought it was beautiful.

"Show me your intelligence on Kessari neurobiology," he said.

                              III.

They gave him Laboratory Four, the deepest level, with a staff of
eleven researchers and access to everything in the classified database.
They gave him a cot, a coffeepot, and a deadline: fourteen days. The
remaining five days would be needed for manufacturing and deployment.

Garrett stood at the whiteboard and stared at it.

Around him, the researchers waited. They were young — God, they were
young, born after the first Kessari contact, raised in a world that had
always known aliens existed. Dr. Lena Vasquez, the neuroscientist. Dr.
Emil Forde, the xenobiologist. Captain Sarah Kim, the weapons systems
engineer. Others. All watching him with the expression he recognized:
awe mixed with fear. The monster who had made Calydon possible, brought
back from exile to save them.

"Everything we know about Kessari neurochemistry," he said. "On my desk
in one hour."

They scrambled.

He sat down with the coffeepot and began to read. The Kessari brain was
remarkably similar to the human brain in gross architecture — bilateral
symmetry, centralized processing, electrochemical signaling — but with
one critical difference that xenobiologists had noted since first
contact: the Kessari possessed a structure called the vha-mesh, a dense
neural network connecting the prefrontal analogue directly to the
amygdala analogue, with extensive branching into the sensory cortices.

In humans, empathy was a complex process: the brain recognized another's
emotional state, modeled it internally, and produced a corresponding
emotional response. It was slow, partial, and easily overridden. The
Kessari vha-mesh, by contrast, appeared to be a direct-link empathy
organ. When a Kessari perceived another Kessari in distress, the
vha-mesh transmitted that distress directly into the observer's
emotional centers, raw and unfiltered. The observer felt it, not as
sympathy or understanding, but as their own pain.

This was why the Kessari had no concept of crime within their own
species. You could not hurt another Kessari without hurting yourself.
The vha-mesh made selfishness neurologically agonizing.

It was also why they could wage war against aliens without hesitation.
The vha-mesh only activated for other Kessari. Humans, to the Kessari
brain, were objects. Furniture that talked.

Garrett stared at the neurological diagrams. He felt the old machinery
of his mind beginning to turn — gears engaging, tumblers falling. The
thing that made him dangerous: the ability to see a system, find its
fulcrum, and design a lever.

"Dr. Vasquez," he said. "Come here."

She came. He pointed to the vha-mesh diagram.

"Can we stimulate this artificially? With a targeted field?"

She frowned. "In theory. A precisely calibrated electromagnetic pulse at
the right frequency could activate the vha-mesh receptors. But they'd
need a signal to receive — another Kessari in distress."

"What if the signal wasn't from another Kessari?"

"I don't follow."

"What if we could broadcast the neurochemical signature of distress
from a non-Kessari source? Say, a human? If the vha-mesh can't
distinguish the species of origin — if it just reads the signal as
'another being in pain' — what would happen?"

Vasquez stared at him. He watched her understand.

"They'd feel it," she said. "They'd feel what their victims feel."

"Yes."

"All of it?"

"That's what I need to know."

She sat down at a terminal and began working. Garrett poured himself
another cup of coffee and looked at the ceiling. In the fluorescent
light, his hands were the hands of a sixty-one-year-old man. Scarred
from a lab accident in his thirties. Steady as stone.

He thought about Calydon. He thought about twenty-two thousand dead.
He thought about the fact that he was about to build another weapon, and
that this one might be worse than any of the others, and that he was
going to build it anyway.

He drank his coffee and waited for results.

                              IV.

The prototype was ready on Day Nine.

They called it the Empathy Projector, which was too gentle a name for
what it did, but Garrett had learned long ago that the naming of weapons
was a form of denial. You called a thing that vaporized cities a
"device." You called a missile that sterilized continents "ordnance."
You called a machine that forced another being to experience the full
weight of its victims' suffering "a projector."

The unit was the size of a footlocker, powered by a compact fusion cell,
with a transmission array that looked like a satellite dish crossbred
with an MRI scanner. It generated a modulated electromagnetic field that
activated the Kessari vha-mesh at a range of approximately three
kilometers, while simultaneously broadcasting a composite signal
assembled from recorded human neurochemical patterns — specifically,
the patterns associated with extreme terror, grief, and physical agony.

In testing, using captured Kessari neural tissue, the results were
conclusive. The vha-mesh could not distinguish the signal's species of
origin. It read human suffering as if it were Kessari suffering. And
because the vha-mesh was a direct-link system with no attenuation
filters — because it had evolved to make empathy involuntary and total —
the receiver experienced the full, undiminished force of the transmitted
pain.

"It's not a weapon," Vasquez said quietly, on the night they confirmed
the results. They were alone in the lab. The others had gone to eat.
"It's not even a punishment. It's just... truth."

"It's a weapon," Garrett said. "Don't prettify it."

"But all it does is make them feel what they've done."

"That's what makes it a weapon."

He picked up the phone and called General Aldous.

"It's ready," he said. "I need to talk to you about deployment."

                              V.

The briefing room was full of uniforms. Aldous had assembled the Joint
Defense Staff, forty-three officers from every branch, and they sat in
rows of steel chairs like an audience at a very grim theater.

Garrett stood at the front. He had not worn a uniform, and his flannel
shirt and heavy trousers looked strange against the backdrop of flags
and insignia. He didn't care. He had stopped caring about how he looked
to military men on the day he stopped being one.

"The weapon is called the Empathy Projector," he said. "Here is what it
does."

He explained. When he finished, there was silence.

General Aldous spoke first. "What's the effective range?"

"Three kilometers per unit. We can blanket a ship at that range, or a
ground position. For fleet engagement, you'd need to deploy multiple
units on fast-attack craft, close to knife-fighting range."

"Casualties?"

"On our side? None from the weapon itself. You still need to get within
three klicks of a Kessari warship, so your pilots will take conventional
fire on approach. On their side: no fatalities from the weapon directly.
Incapacitation. Total neural overload. Every Kessari in range will
experience the cumulative suffering of every human being whose
neurochemical signature is in our broadcast library."

A brigadier general in the second row raised his hand. "How much
suffering are we talking about?"

Garrett looked at him. "We loaded the broadcast library with recordings
from the Calydon refugee camps. The medical stations on Titan. The
bombardment survivors on New Adelaide. The sum total of human suffering
inflicted by Kessari forces over twelve years of conflict."

Silence.

"They'll feel all of it?"

"Simultaneously. Every death. Every wound. Every terrified child. All at
once."

An admiral near the back stood up. "And what happens to a Kessari that
experiences this?"

"They collapse. Complete neural shutdown. Not death — the brain
protects itself by going dark. They'll be unconscious for hours,
possibly days. When they wake up, based on our models, they'll be
fundamentally altered. The vha-mesh doesn't forget. Every Kessari
exposed will carry the memory of that suffering permanently."

"So we're not killing them," Aldous said carefully. "We're... educating
them."

"Don't," Garrett said. His voice was flat and hard. "Don't make it
sound noble. I've designed kinetic weapons that kill cleanly. This
weapon doesn't kill. It breaks minds. It fills another being's
consciousness with agony so complete that their brain shuts down to
survive it. The fact that the agony is real — that we're forcing them
to feel what their victims actually felt — does not make it humane. It
makes it something there is no word for yet."

He looked around the room. "You asked me to build you a weapon that
could stop the Kessari armada. This will stop them. I am telling you,
as the man who built it, that you should think very carefully before you
deploy it."

"We have nine days," Aldous said.

"Then think quickly."

                              VI.

They deployed it. Of course they deployed it. Garrett had known they
would from the moment the prototype powered up. He had known it the way
you know a stone will fall when you drop it: not with surprise, but with
the weary certainty of physics.

They built three hundred units in seven days. The manufacturing
facilities on the Lunar Farside ran triple shifts. The units were loaded
onto fast-attack corvettes — the Sparrow-class, small and quick, built
for close engagement.

The Kessari armada arrived on schedule, a constellation of warships
filling the sky between Earth and Mars. Four hundred twelve vessels
arranged in their three-sphere formation, fighter screens glittering
like metal snow between the layers.

Garrett watched from the command center at Fort Braxton, three hundred
feet underground, surrounded by screens and officers and the quiet hum
of machinery tracking the end of the world or its salvation.

The conventional forces engaged first. The UTDC Third Fleet — two
hundred warships, everything Earth had — moved to intercept at the
orbit of Mars. It was a holding action. Everyone knew the Third Fleet
could not win. They needed to buy time for the Sparrow squadrons to
close range.

The battle lasted eleven hours.

Garrett watched it on the tactical display, each ship a point of light,
each death a light going dark. He had designed weapons that had killed
some of the people dying on those screens. He had designed the Kinetic
Array that the heavy cruisers were firing. He had designed the warheads
on the torpedoes. His work, destroying people on both sides.

The Third Fleet lost sixty-eight ships. Nine thousand personnel. They
held the Kessari formation long enough.

The Sparrow squadrons came in fast, below the plane of engagement,
running dark with minimal emissions. Thirty corvettes, each carrying ten
Empathy Projectors. They reached the three-kilometer envelope of the
Kessari dreadnought screen at 1847 hours Zulu time.

They activated the projectors.

Garrett watched the Kessari formation on the tactical display. For
three seconds, nothing changed. The alien ships continued firing,
continued maneuvering, continued killing.

Then the formation broke.

It did not break the way a military formation breaks — with orderly
withdrawal or desperate scattering. It broke the way a man breaks when
something inside him tears loose. Ships veered off course, stopped
firing, drifted. Drives shut down. Weapons went cold. Across a volume
of space twelve thousand kilometers wide, four hundred twelve warships
ceased to function as a military force and became four hundred twelve
metal shells full of beings who were, for the first time in their
lives, drowning in human pain.

In the command center, someone cheered. Then someone else. Then the room
erupted, officers on their feet, pounding tables, shouting. Nine
thousand dead and two hundred million miles of running battle, and it
was over. The Kessari armada was drifting, powerless, its crews
collapsed at their stations.

Garrett did not cheer. He sat in his chair and looked at the screen
and thought about what was happening inside those ships. Thousands of
Kessari, each one feeling — truly feeling, in every nerve, in every
cell of their vha-mesh — the cumulative terror of every human being
they had ever terrorized. The screaming of Calydon's children. The slow
suffocation of Titan's wounded. The fire and the dark and the silence
after.

Not killed. Not injured. Given the truth.

He wondered if the truth was worse.

                              VII.

The surrender came forty-eight hours later.

The Kessari fleet commander, a being called Thresh-vha-Oruk, transmitted
from the flagship in a voice that the translators rendered as "broken."
Not angry. Not defiant. Broken, in the way that a person was broken who
had seen something they could never unsee.

"We will vacate your system," Thresh-vha-Oruk said. "We will not
return. We... did not know."

"Didn't know what?" Aldous asked, from the command center, his voice
broadcast across the gulf of space.

A long pause. The translators hummed.

"We did not know you suffered."

Another pause.

"We did not know you were real."

Garrett sat in his chair and listened. Around him, the command center
was electric with triumph. The war was over. Earth was saved. The
weapon had worked.

The weapon had worked.

Thresh-vha-Oruk continued: "The vha-mesh shows us each other. It has
always shown us each other. We knew that beings without the mesh
existed. We did not know — we could not have known — that they
experienced. That they felt. We perceived you as... patterns. Movement
without interiority. Your weapon has shown us otherwise. We cannot
undo what the mesh has shown us. We will carry it forever."

"Then we have nothing further to discuss," Aldous said.

"No," said the Kessari commander. "We carry your suffering now. It is
inside us. It will not leave. You should know this: we will carry it
as penance, but it will also drive some of us mad. Your weapon has not
merely defeated us. It has broken something in us that cannot be
repaired."

The transmission ended. The Kessari fleet engaged drives and began the
long deceleration burn toward the outer system. Within a week, they had
crossed the Oort perimeter. Within a month, they were gone.

Earth celebrated. Garrett went back to Vermont.

                              VIII.

The trouble started three months later.

Captain Sarah Kim was the first. She had been the weapons systems
engineer on the project, the one who had calibrated the Empathy
Projectors and run the final tests. She had been aboard one of the
Sparrow corvettes during deployment, within the three-kilometer envelope,
monitoring the equipment when the projectors activated.

She called Garrett at his cabin on a Sunday afternoon.

"Dr. Garrett, I need to talk to you."

He knew her voice. It was wrong. Flat in the places where it should
have been sharp. Tight in the places where it should have been loose.
The voice of a person holding something inside them that was too large
for the space.

"Go ahead, Captain."

"I can feel them."

He set down his coffee cup. "Feel who?"

"The Kessari. The ones on the ships. When the projectors activated, I
was inside the envelope. I was wearing the monitoring headset. The
system was broadcasting human suffering toward the Kessari, but the
field isn't perfectly directional, Dr. Garrett. There was backscatter.
And I was wearing a neural interface."

Garrett closed his eyes.

"I felt what they felt," Kim said. "Not the human suffering we
broadcast — I already knew about that. I felt the Kessari response.
Through the backscatter, through the headset, I felt what it was like
to be a Kessari whose vha-mesh was activating for the first time with
non-Kessari input. I felt them... waking up. I felt them realizing that
humans were real. I felt their horror. I felt—" Her voice broke. "I
felt their guilt, Dr. Garrett. And it hasn't stopped. It's been three
months and I can still feel it."

He gripped the edge of the table.

"How many others?" he asked.

"All of us. Every operator on the Sparrows who was within the envelope
during activation. Seventeen people. We've been talking to each other.
Some of us are... not doing well."

"Define 'not doing well.'"

"Lieutenant Okoye tried to kill himself last week. They stopped him.
Ensign Pratt hasn't spoken in nine days. The rest of us—" She paused.
"We can feel them. Still. Not just the guilt. Everything. Their grief
for what they did. Their grief for what they lost — their certainty
that they were alone in the universe, that nothing outside the mesh
mattered. It was a kind of innocence, Dr. Garrett. A terrible
innocence, but it was theirs, and we took it from them."

"I know," Garrett said.

"And now we carry both sides. The human suffering that we broadcast, and
the Kessari suffering that came back. Both. At the same time. Do you
understand what that's like? To carry both sides of a war inside your
head?"

"No," Garrett said. "I don't."

"It's not survivable," Kim said quietly. "Not as a permanent condition.
We can't turn it off. The neural pathways have been permanently altered.
The backscatter rewired our brains the same way the projectors rewired
the Kessari. We're empaths now, Dr. Garrett. Real empaths, not the
pretend kind. We feel everything. We can't ride the subway without
feeling every person's grief and fear and loneliness. We can't read the
news. We can't—"

She stopped. He heard her breathing.

"We can't live in the world," she said. "The world has too much pain in
it, and we can't stop feeling it."

Garrett sat in his cabin in the Vermont woods and listened to the
silence on the line.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked.

"I don't know. Fix it. Undo it. Build another machine." A sound that
might have been a laugh. "You're the weapons designer. You broke us.
Fix us."

"I'll try," he said.

He hung up. He sat in the chair. Outside, snow was falling on the
pines, the way it had been falling on the night the phone rang and the
war began. The same silence. The same owl. The same cold white world
that didn't care who suffered in it.

He picked up the phone and called Vasquez.

"Lena. We have a problem."

                              IX.

He went back to Fort Braxton. He went back to Laboratory Four. He stood
in front of the whiteboard, and this time, for the first time in his
career, he was trying to unbuild something.

The backscatter effect was real. Vasquez confirmed it within days. The
Empathy Projector's field, intended to activate the Kessari vha-mesh,
had also stimulated corresponding structures in the human brain — the
mirror neuron system, the anterior insula, the cingulate cortex.
Structures that, in normal humans, produced empathy at a manageable
level. The projector's field had amplified these structures by a factor
of several hundred, creating a permanent state of hyper-empathy that
could not be reversed.

"The neural pathways have physically remodeled," Vasquez said. "It's
like trying to unfold a piece of paper. You can flatten it, but the
crease is always there."

"Then dampen it. Block the signal."

"We can try pharmacological suppression. But the structures involved are
the same ones that process normal human emotion. If we block the
hyper-empathy, we block all empathy. All emotion. The operators would
become functional sociopaths."

"Is that what they want?"

"I asked Kim. She said she'd rather die."

Garrett stood at the whiteboard. He had designed weapons that killed
quickly and weapons that killed slowly. He had designed weapons that
destroyed bodies and weapons that destroyed minds. This was the first
weapon he had ever designed that destroyed the capacity to look away
from suffering, and it was, he now understood, the most terrible weapon
of them all.

Because the suffering was real. Kim and the operators were not
hallucinating. They were perceiving, with brutal accuracy, the actual
emotional states of the people around them. They were drowning not in
illusion but in truth. The world really was that full of pain. They had
simply lost the ability to not notice.

He wrote on the whiteboard:

THE WEAPON WORKS BY MAKING SUFFERING VISIBLE.
THE WEAPON CANNOT BE UNDONE BECAUSE THE SUFFERING IS REAL.
THE ONLY CURE IS TO REDUCE THE SUFFERING.

He stared at what he had written for a long time. Then he picked up an
eraser and wiped the board clean.

He went to see the operators.

They were housed in a wing of the base hospital, seventeen men and women
in rooms with soft lighting and quiet ventilation and walls the color of
eggshell. They looked, to his eye, like people who had been awake for
months. Not tired. Flayed. Their eyes tracked every movement in the
room, every face, every micro-expression, with an attentiveness that was
physically painful to witness.

Kim met him in the corridor. She looked ten years older than she had
three months ago.

"Thank you for coming back," she said.

"I can't fix it," he told her. He owed her that much: the truth,
immediately, without equivocation. "The neural remodeling is permanent.
Pharmacological suppression would eliminate all emotional processing.
There is no selective intervention possible."

She nodded. She had expected this. He could see it in her face — no,
he could not feel it the way she felt things, but he could see it, and
that was enough.

"Then what?" she asked.

"I don't know yet."

He visited each operator. He sat with them. He listened. Lieutenant
Okoye, the one who had tried to kill himself, was a young man from
Lagos with a round face and hands that trembled constantly.

"It's not the pain," Okoye said. "I can endure pain. It's the volume.
Everywhere I look, someone is suffering. Not dramatically — just the
ordinary suffering of ordinary people. Loneliness. Fear. Grief. The
small, constant ache of being alive. I feel all of it now, and I cannot
make it stop, and I cannot help, and the helplessness—" He stopped. His
hands clenched. "The helplessness is the worst part. To feel it all and
be able to do nothing."

Garrett listened. He had no comfort to offer. He had built the machine
that broke them, and he could not unbuild it, and the things Okoye was
describing were not malfunctions. They were features. The weapon's
purpose was to make suffering undeniable. It had achieved its purpose.
The only miscalculation was that it worked on both sides.

He spent two weeks at Fort Braxton. He ran tests. He consulted with
neurologists, pharmacologists, psychiatrists. He filled seventeen
whiteboards with equations and erased them all.

In the end, he wrote a report. He addressed it to General Aldous.

"The Empathy Projector's secondary effects on human operators are
permanent and irreversible. The affected personnel cannot be returned
to normal functioning. Pharmacological suppression of symptoms would
require the elimination of all emotional processing and is not
recommended.

"Recommendation: The seventeen affected operators should be given full
medical pensions, permanent support, and the option of assisted
placement in low-population environments where the density of human
emotional input is reduced to manageable levels.

"Further recommendation: All Empathy Projector units should be
destroyed. The weapon's secondary effects make it unsuitable for
deployment under any circumstances. Humans cannot wield it without being
broken by it. It is a weapon that wounds its user as surely as its
target.

"Final recommendation: The project files should be classified at the
highest level and never reopened. The Empathy Projector is not a weapon
that humanity should possess. Not because it is too destructive —
humanity possesses weapons far more destructive — but because it is too
honest. It forces the user to confront the reality of the suffering they
inflict, and human beings are not built to survive that confrontation.

"This is my last report. I will not design weapons again."

He signed it. He handed it to Aldous. He drove back to Vermont.

                              X.

Spring came. The snow melted. Garrett planted a garden behind the cabin
— tomatoes, beans, squash. He had never grown anything before. His
hands, which had drawn the schematics of weapons that killed millions,
turned soil and pressed seeds into the dark earth and ran water from the
hose in gentle arcs.

Kim called sometimes. She had moved to a cabin in Montana, near no one.
The other operators were scattered: small towns, remote properties,
places where the press of human feeling was thin enough to bear.

"It's better here," she said, on a call in June. "Fewer people. Fewer
feelings. I can manage it most days. The meadowlarks are loud in the
morning. I can feel—" She paused. "I can feel that they're content.
The birds. It's not just pain. I feel everything now. The birds don't
suffer much. They're mostly just... being."

"Good," Garrett said.

"Do you know what the Kessari fleet commander said? That we took their
innocence? He was right. We did. We took theirs, and we lost ours, and
maybe that's what war always does, and maybe it doesn't matter whether
you're the one who fires or the one who designs the firing mechanism
or the one who just — watches."

Garrett looked out the window at his garden. The tomato plants were
small and green and leaning toward the light.

"Martin," Kim said. "Was it worth it?"

He thought about the Kessari armada drifting dead in space. He thought
about nine thousand Third Fleet personnel who had died buying time for
the Sparrows. He thought about the seventeen operators in their quiet
cabins, carrying both sides of the war in their rewired brains. He
thought about Thresh-vha-Oruk saying, "We did not know you were real."

He thought about Calydon.

"I don't know," he said. "Ask me in ten years."

He hung up. He went outside. He knelt in the dirt and tended his
tomatoes. The sun was warm on his back. An ant crawled across his hand,
and he watched it with the careful attention of a man who had spent his
life studying systems, finding fulcrums, designing levers.

The ant crawled off his hand and into the soil. Garrett stayed kneeling
in the garden. The sun moved. The shadows moved. The small green things
grew toward the light, and Martin Garrett, who had built the most
terrible weapon in human history — a weapon that did nothing more or
less than tell the truth — knelt in the dirt and watched them grow.

                            [THE END]

                              BORDERS

                        by Sanjay Mukherjee

================================================================================

                              I.

The border between the Kethari and the Sulai ran along the Riven
Escarpment for four hundred kilometers, following the geological fault
line that had split the continent of Pashan in the Third Geological
Epoch, approximately seven hundred million years before either culture
existed to dispute it. The escarpment was a natural boundary — a sheer
cliff face, three hundred meters high in places, separating the
high-altitude thornlands of the Kethari plateau from the humid lowland
forests of the Sulai basin. There was one crossing point.

The crossing was called, in the Kethari language, the Hesh-uru-pa: the
Wound That Does Not Close. In the Sulai language, which bore no
taxonomic relationship to Kethari despite the two peoples' shared
genetic origin, it was called nal-dishem: the Place Where the Land
Remembers.

Both names, Corporal Adhi Rao reflected, were better names for a border
crossing than anything he'd encountered in his training. His training
had called it Checkpoint Seven.

Rao stood at his post in the guard station that straddled the Hesh-uru-pa
— a concrete and steel structure bolted to the lip of the escarpment
like a barnacle on a ship's hull. Below him, the switchback path
descended the cliff face in forty-seven hairpin turns, each one carved
into the rock by Sulai engineers four centuries ago, during the last
period of open contact between the two cultures. Above him, the
thornland stretched to the horizon, purple-brown under the amber sky,
the spined vegetation swaying in the thin wind like the fur of some
vast, irritable animal.

He had been posted here for eleven months. In that time, exactly
fourteen authorized crossings had occurred: twelve diplomatic couriers,
one emergency medical transport, and one geological survey team that had
gotten lost and wandered across the border by accident, causing a
diplomatic incident that consumed six weeks of negotiation to resolve.

Today was the day of the fifteenth crossing. A Sulai trade delegation,
three members, authorized by the Joint Border Commission at the highest
level, was ascending the switchback path to discuss — for the first
time in forty years — the possibility of reopening limited commerce
between the two cultures.

Rao checked his sidearm. He checked the communication panel. He checked
his reflection in the guard station window and straightened his collar.
He was twenty-four years old, Kethari by birth and upbringing, the son
of a border guard and the grandson of a border guard, assigned to this
post because his family understood borders the way other families
understood farming or metalwork: as a hereditary profession, a craft
passed down through the blood.

He had never spoken to a Sulai.

He had, of course, learned things about them. Every Kethari child
learned things about the Sulai, in the same way that every child
everywhere learns things about the people on the other side of whatever
line divides their world. He knew that the Sulai were, biologically,
nearly identical to the Kethari — the same species, diverged nine
hundred years ago when the Great Partition had split the people of
Pashan into two populations separated by the escarpment. He knew that
the Sulai lived in the lowland forests, in cities built among the
roots of the great basin trees, and that their culture had evolved in
response to the dense, humid, interconnected ecology of the forest
floor. He knew that they spoke a language that sounded, to Kethari
ears, like water running over stones. He knew that they were, according
to everything he had been taught since childhood, fundamentally
different from the Kethari in values, temperament, and worldview.

He also knew — because he had read the classified briefing documents
that his position required — that almost everything he had been taught
about the Sulai since childhood was, at best, an oversimplification
and, at worst, propaganda.

The briefing documents were clinical. They had been written by the Joint
Border Commission's anthropological staff, and they described the Sulai
with the careful neutrality of scientists cataloguing a species that
happened to be culturally and linguistically complex. The Sulai, the
documents stated, organized their society around an elaborate system of
reciprocal obligation called the nal-mesh — a word that shared a root
with nal-dishem, the Place Where the Land Remembers, and that
translated, approximately, as "the web of memory and debt." Every Sulai
carried a mental accounting of who had given them what, who they owed,
who owed them, and how these obligations connected them to every other
member of their community. The nal-mesh was not merely a social custom;
it was, according to the anthropological staff, the foundational
structure of Sulai cognition, the lens through which the Sulai
perceived all relationship, all exchange, all meaning.

The Kethari had nothing like it. Kethari society was organized around
the principle of resh-atu: individual sufficiency. Each Kethari was
expected to be complete in themselves, to need nothing from others that
they could not provide for themselves, to give nothing that was not
freely chosen. The highest Kethari virtue was self-containment; the
highest Sulai virtue was interconnection. The border between them was
not merely geographical. It was ontological.

Rao straightened his collar again. He heard footsteps on the
switchback path below.

                              II.

They emerged from the path one at a time. The leader was a tall woman
with the dark complexion and broad features common to the Sulai
lowlanders, her hair bound in the elaborate braided style that the
briefing documents identified as denoting professional status. She
wore a flowing garment of layered green fabric — forest-colored, Rao
noted, the way Kethari clothing tended toward the purple-brown of the
thornlands. Behind her came two others: a younger man carrying a
leather case that presumably held documents, and an older woman with
the abstracted expression of a scholar or technician.

The leader approached the guard station and stopped at the painted line
on the ground. The line was red. It marked the border.

"I am Sula-nal-Mehani," she said. She spoke in Kethari, accented but
comprehensible, the consonants rounded where a Kethari speaker would
sharpen them. "I am the voice of the Sulai Trade Commission. I carry
credentials from the Nal-Mesh Council of the Basin Cities."

"Corporal Adhi Rao, Kethari Border Service," Rao said. "Your crossing
has been authorized. May I examine your credentials?"

She handed them across the line. Their fingers did not touch. The
credentials were a set of documents in both Kethari and Sulai script,
stamped with the seals of both the Joint Border Commission and the
Nal-Mesh Council. Rao examined them with the thoroughness his training
required, checking the seal impressions, the paper quality, the
signature patterns.

As he examined the documents, the younger Sulai man stepped forward and
said something in Sulai to Mehani. Rao did not understand the words,
but he understood the tone: anxiety, impatience, the universal sound of
a subordinate asking a superior how much longer something would take.

Mehani replied in Sulai, a brief phrase, and the young man stepped back.

Rao looked up. "Your documents are in order. You may cross."

Mehani nodded. She stepped over the red line. The other two followed.
For a moment, all three Sulai stood inside the guard station, on
Kethari soil, and the air felt different — charged with the weight of
something historic or at least unprecedented in Rao's experience.

"The diplomatic escort will arrive in twenty minutes to take you to the
capital," Rao said. "You may wait here."

They waited. Rao stood at his post. The silence was thick.

He found himself studying them — their posture, their gestures, the
small movements of their hands and faces. The briefing documents had
noted that the Sulai communicated as much through gesture and physical
proximity as through speech, a consequence of their nal-mesh social
structure: in a culture built on reciprocal obligation, the ability to
read another person's emotional state and intentions was not merely
useful but essential. The Kethari, by contrast, valued verbal precision
and emotional restraint. A Kethari who fidgeted or stood too close was
considered undisciplined. A Sulai who stood still and spoke only when
spoken to was considered hostile.

Mehani was watching him watch her. She smiled.

"You are curious," she said, in her accented Kethari.

Rao stiffened. A Kethari guard was not supposed to be curious. A
Kethari guard was supposed to be a function: verify, authorize, observe,
report.

"I am performing my duties," he said.

"Yes. And you are curious." Her smile did not waver. "It is permitted to
be curious, Corporal. Among my people, curiosity about a stranger is
the first form of respect."

He did not know what to say to this, so he said nothing. She turned
away and spoke to her colleagues in Sulai. The older woman laughed
softly. Rao wondered what they were saying. He wondered what it would
be like to understand.

The diplomatic escort arrived. The Sulai delegation was taken to the
capital. Rao returned to his post. He stood at the guard station window
and looked down the switchback path to the forest below, where the
green canopy of the Sulai basin stretched to the horizon like a second
sea.

That night, lying on his cot in the barracks behind the guard station,
he opened the Kethari-Sulai dictionary that the Joint Border Commission
had issued to all checkpoint personnel. It was a thin volume — the two
languages were so different that comprehensive translation required
multiple volumes that did not, to his knowledge, exist — but it
contained basic vocabulary and a pronunciation guide.

He turned to the first page and began to read.

                              III.

The trade delegation remained in Kethari territory for nine days. During
that time, they crossed Checkpoint Seven twice more: once to return to
Sulai territory for consultations, once to re-enter. Each crossing
brought them through Rao's guard station, and each time, Mehani paused
to speak with him.

These exchanges were brief. Protocol demanded brevity — a border guard
was not supposed to fraternize with foreign nationals. But Mehani seemed
incapable of passing through a space without filling it with human
connection, and Rao found that her small observations and questions
lodged in his mind like seeds in soil.

"The wind on the plateau is very dry," she said on the second crossing.
"In the basin, the air is always wet. My skin feels — what is the
Kethari word? — taut. Like a drum."

"Kesh-attu," Rao said. "Drawn tight."

"Kesh-attu." She tried the word, gave it too many syllables, laughed
at herself. "In Sulai, we would say nal-piru — the feeling of being in
a place that does not know you yet."

"Your language has a word for that?"

"My language has a word for every kind of relationship, Corporal. Even
the relationship between a person and an unfamiliar wind."

On the third crossing, she brought him a small wrapped package.

"This is nal-keshu," she said. "A gift to mark a new connection. It is
customary among my people when one has been made to feel welcome by a
stranger."

He unwrapped it. Inside was a small carved figure, made from dense
forest wood, dark and fragrant. It depicted an animal he did not
recognize — something between a lizard and a bird, with a fanned crest
and curling tail.

"This is a veshani," Mehani said. "It lives in the canopy. It sings at
dusk. We say that the veshani is the first creature to notice when a
stranger enters the forest."

"I cannot accept gifts from foreign nationals," Rao said. He held the
figure out to return it.

Mehani looked at him. For a moment, her composure — that easy, flowing
warmth — flickered, and he saw beneath it something that he recognized:
the careful hurt of a person whose gesture of goodwill had been refused.

"Among my people," she said quietly, "to refuse a nal-keshu is to say:
I do not acknowledge the connection between us. It is not merely a
refusal. It is a denial."

Rao stood with the carved figure in his outstretched hand. He thought
about regulations. He thought about the word nal-keshu, which was not
in his dictionary. He thought about the expression on Mehani's face,
which was in no dictionary but which he could read as clearly as he
could read his own reflection.

He put the figure in his pocket.

"Thank you," he said.

She smiled. The delegation moved on. Rao stood at his post with the
weight of a small carved bird-lizard against his thigh and the feeling
of having crossed a line that was not painted on any floor.

                              IV.

The delegation departed. New crossings were authorized. Trade
negotiations continued. Over the following months, Rao processed
twenty-three authorized crossings — more in six months than in the
previous five years combined. The Joint Border Commission was cautiously
optimistic. The Sulai Trade Commission was enthusiastic. The Kethari
Foreign Ministry was noncommittal, which was its natural state.

Rao studied the dictionary. He moved on to the grammar guide — a
classified document that he had to sign out from the intelligence
office. He began to learn Sulai.

It was like learning to breathe a different atmosphere. Kethari was a
language of precision and isolation: each word a self-contained unit,
each sentence a declaration of individual position. Sulai was a
language of connection and context: each word defined by its
relationship to other words, each sentence a map of obligations and
associations. In Kethari, you said "I see the mountain." In Sulai, you
said something closer to "The mountain and I are in a seeing
relationship, which began when I arrived and which obliges me to
acknowledge its presence." The Sulai verb for "see" contained within it
an implicit acknowledgment that seeing created a bond between seer and
seen — that to perceive something was to enter into a relationship with
it, and that all relationships carried weight.

Rao practiced in the evenings, speaking to himself in the barracks,
stumbling over the liquid consonants and the tonal shifts that carried
meaning in Sulai the way emphasis carried meaning in Kethari. He was
not gifted with languages. The sounds felt wrong in his mouth,
thick and unfamiliar, like food from a cuisine he had never tasted.
But he persisted, driven by something he could not entirely name — a
curiosity that had, as Mehani had noted, been present from the
beginning, and that now demanded to be fed.

He told no one. His commanding officer, Lieutenant Vashti, was a rigid
woman who had served at Checkpoint Seven for fifteen years and who
regarded the Sulai with the reflexive suspicion of a lifelong border
guard. The other guards were younger, indifferent, marking time until
transfer to a more interesting post. None of them would understand why
a Kethari border guard would want to learn the language of the people
he was paid to keep out.

But they were not kept out anymore. That was the thing. The crossings
were increasing. The trade negotiations were progressing. For the first
time since the Great Partition, the Wound That Does Not Close was
beginning, tentatively, to close.

Rao wanted to understand what was on the other side.

                              V.

Mehani returned in the sixth month. She was leading another trade
delegation, larger this time — seven members, including two cultural
advisors whose role, Rao gathered, was to help the Sulai negotiators
navigate the complexities of Kethari social protocol.

She approached the guard station. Rao checked her credentials with the
prescribed thoroughness. When he handed them back, he said, in careful,
halting Sulai:

"Nal-veshuri-mei, Sula-nal-Mehani."

It meant, approximately: "I welcome you, and in doing so, I acknowledge
the relationship that your previous crossing created between us."

Mehani stared at him. Behind her, the two cultural advisors exchanged a
glance that Rao could not interpret.

"Your pronunciation is terrible," Mehani said, in Sulai.

"I know," Rao replied, in Sulai. "I have been studying for three months.
There is no one to practice with."

She laughed — a full, surprised, delighted laugh that broke across the
guard station like sunlight breaking through cloud cover on the plateau.
The other delegation members looked startled. One of the cultural
advisors — the older one, a small man with a lined face and patient
eyes — stepped forward and said something rapid in Sulai that Rao could
not follow.

Mehani translated. "He says: A Kethari who learns Sulai is either a spy
or a miracle. He would like to know which you are."

Rao considered this. "Tell him I am a border guard who would like to
understand what he is guarding."

Mehani translated. The cultural advisor studied Rao for a long moment.
Then he smiled — a slow, serious smile that seemed to carry the weight
of old grief — and said a single word.

"Nal-dishem," Mehani said. "The Place Where the Land Remembers. He says
you are standing in it."

The delegation crossed. As they passed through the guard station, the
cultural advisor paused beside Rao and placed his hand briefly on Rao's
forearm. It was a gesture Rao did not recognize — not a Kethari
gesture, not in any briefing document.

Later, looking it up in the grammar guide, he found a description of
the Sulai practice of nal-hesh: a touch to the forearm that signified
the beginning of a teaching relationship. The one who touches says, in
effect: I have something to give you. The one who is touched says, by
allowing it: I am willing to receive.

Rao sat in the barracks that night with the grammar guide open on his
lap and the carved veshani on the shelf above his cot, and he understood
that he had crossed a border that no paint on a floor could mark.

                              VI.

The cultural advisor's name was Sula-nal-Tesshen. He was seventy-three
years old. He had spent his life studying the history of the Partition
and the ways in which the two peoples of Pashan had diverged. He had
written, in Sulai, a three-volume history of the border that was
considered the definitive scholarly work on the subject. He had never
crossed the border himself until now.

He stayed. The trade delegation went to the capital, but Tesshen
requested permission to remain at Checkpoint Seven for the duration of
the delegation's visit, citing scholarly interest in the border crossing
as a cultural site. The Joint Border Commission approved the request.
Lieutenant Vashti did not.

"He's intelligence," Vashti told Rao. "They don't send seventy-year-old
scholars to sit at border posts for fun. He's gathering information."

"About what? The checkpoint is a concrete box. There's nothing here
that isn't in the public architectural plans."

"There's you," Vashti said. "There's the way we operate. Procedures,
schedules, personnel patterns. This is what intelligence looks like,
Corporal. It looks harmless."

Rao said nothing. He did not believe Tesshen was intelligence. He
believed Tesshen was exactly what he appeared to be: an old scholar who
had spent his life studying a border he had never crossed, and who
wanted, at the end of that life, to stand on the other side and see
what the view looked like.

He was right.

Tesshen sat in the guard station during the day — Vashti had grudgingly
assigned him a chair and a small table — and wrote in a leather-bound
journal in Sulai script, looking up periodically to study the
thornlands through the window with an expression of wondering
attention. In the evenings, when Rao's shift ended, they sat together
on the stone lip of the escarpment and Tesshen taught him Sulai.

The lessons were unlike anything Rao had experienced. Tesshen did not
teach vocabulary or grammar in isolation. He taught the language as the
Sulai understood it: as a living system of relationships, each word
connected to every other word through webs of association, history, and
obligation. To learn the word for "tree" was to learn the tree's
relationship to the forest, the forest's relationship to the people who
lived in it, the people's relationship to each other and to the soil
and to the water that fell from the sky and worked its way down through
the root systems into the great aquifers beneath the basin.

"In Kethari," Tesshen said one evening, in his slow, patient Kethari
— much better than Mehani's, refined by decades of study — "a word
points to a thing. In Sulai, a word points to the space between things.
The relationship. The connection. You cannot say 'tree' in Sulai
without also saying 'earth' and 'water' and 'the family that lives in
its shade.'"

"That seems inefficient," Rao said.

Tesshen laughed. "It is. Wonderfully inefficient. A Sulai sentence
takes three times as long to speak as a Kethari sentence. But when it
is spoken, it has said three times as much."

Rao practiced. His pronunciation improved. His vocabulary expanded. He
began to dream in fragments of Sulai — disconnected phrases that
floated through his sleeping mind like leaves on the surface of a
river.

Lieutenant Vashti watched. She said nothing more about intelligence,
but her silence was a form of speech, and Rao heard it clearly: this
was noted. This was being observed. A Kethari border guard who fraternized
with Sulai nationals, who learned their language, who sat with an old
man on the edge of the escarpment at sunset and laughed at his own
terrible accent — this was a deviation from the norm, and deviations
from the norm were, in the Kethari Border Service, synonymous with
suspicion.

Rao knew this. He continued anyway. There was something in Tesshen's
teaching that he needed — not just the language, but the way of seeing
that the language encoded. The Sulai way of seeing everything as
connected. Every person, every creature, every stone and drop of water,
bound together in a web of mutual obligation so vast and intricate that
to harm any part of it was to harm yourself.

It was, Rao realized, the opposite of resh-atu. The opposite of
self-sufficiency. The opposite of everything he had been taught to
value.

And it was beautiful.

                              VII.

The formal complaint was filed by Lieutenant Vashti on the seventy-third
day of Tesshen's stay. Rao found out about it when he was summoned to
the intelligence office at headquarters, a two-hour drive from
Checkpoint Seven, and sat in a small room across from a Major he had
never met.

"Corporal Rao. You have been receiving instruction in the Sulai language
from a foreign national."

"Yes, sir."

"Were you authorized to do so?"

"The Joint Border Commission encourages language study among checkpoint
personnel. It is listed as a recommended competency in the—"

"Self-directed study from approved materials is encouraged. Private
instruction from a foreign national is not addressed in the regulations,
which means it falls under the discretionary authority of your
commanding officer, who has filed a concern."

"Lieutenant Vashti believes Tesshen is intelligence."

"Lieutenant Vashti believes, and I am inclined to agree, that your
relationship with this individual has exceeded the bounds of
professional interaction."

Rao sat very still. Professional interaction. The phrase was a border
in itself — a line drawn around what was permitted, with everything
outside it classified as dangerous.

"I am learning his language," Rao said. "I am not sharing classified
information. I am not compromising checkpoint security. I am learning
to speak to the people who cross through my station."

"The people who cross through your station are foreign nationals of a
culture with which we have been in a state of partition for nine
hundred years. The current thaw in relations is diplomatic and
provisional. It does not extend to personal fraternization between
border personnel and Sulai civilians."

"Tesshen is a scholar."

"Tesshen is a Sulai national. The distinction is irrelevant."

The Major looked at a file on the desk. "You were also observed
accepting a gift from a member of a previous trade delegation. A carved
figure. Is that correct?"

The veshani. Someone had seen. Or Vashti had searched his barracks.

"It was a nal-keshu," Rao said. "A greeting gift. To refuse it would
have been a cultural insult to—"

"Corporal. You are a Kethari border guard. Your role is to process
crossings, verify credentials, and maintain the integrity of the
checkpoint. Your role is not to participate in Sulai cultural rituals,
learn Sulai customs, or develop personal relationships with Sulai
nationals. Is that clear?"

"Yes, sir."

"You will discontinue language instruction with the Sulai national.
The gift will be surrendered to the intelligence office for
examination. You will confine your interactions with crossing
personnel to the prescribed protocols."

"Yes, sir."

He drove back to Checkpoint Seven. He told Tesshen that the lessons
would have to stop. The old man listened, nodded, and said nothing
for a long time. They were sitting on the escarpment in the
evening light, the lowland forest spread beneath them in deepening
shades of green.

"In my history of the border," Tesshen said finally, "I wrote about
the last period of open contact, four centuries ago. It ended the
same way. Not with armies. Not with violence. With the small, careful
closings. A regulation here. A prohibition there. Each one reasonable.
Each one, by itself, a small thing. And when you lined them all up,
you had a wall."

"I'm sorry," Rao said.

"Do not be sorry. Be careful. And continue to study." He reached into
his bag and produced a small, leather-bound book. "This is my personal
copy of the nal-mesh — the core text of Sulai social philosophy. It
is not classified. It is not secret. Any Sulai child can recite it from
memory by age twelve. I give it to you not as a nal-keshu — not as a
gift that can be confiscated — but as a nal-tesshu. A teaching text.
It belongs to the relationship between teacher and student, and that
relationship exists outside the authority of border commissions."

Rao took the book. It was small and heavy, the paper thick, the Sulai
script dense and precise.

"I may not be able to read it," he said.

"You will be able to read it," Tesshen said. "Not today. Not tomorrow.
But the language is in you now, Corporal. It is growing. Languages grow
the way forests grow: slowly, invisibly, and then all at once."

                              VIII.

Tesshen left with the returning delegation. Rao returned the carved
veshani to the intelligence office, where a clerk examined it,
x-rayed it, found nothing, and filed it in a drawer. Rao resumed his
duties. He processed crossings. He verified credentials. He maintained
the integrity of the checkpoint.

At night, in the barracks, he read the nal-mesh.

It was, as Tesshen had said, not secret. It was not a strategic
document or a military manual. It was a philosophical text — the Sulai
equivalent of what the Kethari called the resh-atu-pali, the Book of
Self-Sufficiency, which every Kethari child memorized in school. Where
the resh-atu-pali taught that each person was a complete unit, requiring
nothing from others, the nal-mesh taught that each person was a node in
a web, defined entirely by their connections.

"I am because we are," the nal-mesh began. "I owe because I have
received. I give because I am owed. The web holds me. I hold the web."

Rao read it slowly, one passage per night, looking up every third word
in his dictionary. The language was dense and allusive — Sulai
philosophical writing used a formal register that was several levels
more complex than conversational speech — but Tesshen's teaching had
given him the structural framework, and he found that he could, with
effort, follow the argument.

The nal-mesh described a universe of radical interconnection. Nothing
existed in isolation. No act was solitary. No person was complete in
themselves. To believe in self-sufficiency — in resh-atu — was, from
the Sulai perspective, not a philosophy but a pathology: a failure to
perceive the connections that sustained every living being, a kind of
blindness masquerading as strength.

Rao read this and felt something shift inside him. Not a conversion.
Not a rejection of everything Kethari. Something subtler: a widening.
As if a door he had not known existed had opened a crack, and through
that crack he could see a landscape that included his own but extended
beyond it in directions he had not imagined.

He thought about Mehani's smile when she offered the nal-keshu. He
thought about Tesshen's hand on his forearm. He thought about the word
nal-dishem — the Place Where the Land Remembers — and he thought about
what the land might remember, if it could: nine hundred years of two
peoples who were one people, separated by a cliff and a philosophy,
growing apart until they could no longer recognize themselves in each
other's faces.

He thought about the word "border." In Kethari, it was resh-gata:
self-limit. The point beyond which the self did not extend. In Sulai,
it was nal-veru: the place where one web ends and another begins. But
the Sulai word carried a secondary meaning that the Kethari word did
not: nal-veru also meant "the place where two webs might be joined."

                              IX.

The summons came on a morning in the ninth month of his third year at
Checkpoint Seven. Rao was called, again, to the intelligence office at
headquarters. This time, the Major was not alone. Two other officers
sat at the table, and their uniforms bore the insignia of the Kethari
Security Directorate — the internal security service, whose purview
included not just espionage but ideological deviation.

"Corporal Rao. It has come to our attention that you are in possession
of a Sulai philosophical text."

Rao said nothing. He felt the chair beneath him, solid and cold.

"The text was identified during a routine inspection of your barracks.
It is the nal-mesh. A foundational text of Sulai ideology."

"It is a philosophical text available to any Sulai child."

"It is a text that advances a worldview fundamentally opposed to the
principles of Kethari society. Principles that you, as a member of the
Border Service, are sworn to uphold."

Rao looked at the three men across the table. They were older than him.
They had spent their careers protecting the border — not the physical
border, the cliff and the checkpoint, but the ideological border, the
line between Kethari thought and Sulai thought. They believed, as they
had been trained to believe, that the two were incompatible. That to
understand the Sulai way of seeing was to be contaminated by it. That
empathy was a security risk.

"Corporal, we are not unreasonable. We understand that your position
requires some degree of cultural awareness. But there is a difference
between awareness and immersion. Your language study, your relationship
with the Sulai scholar, your possession of this text — taken together,
they suggest a pattern of ideological drift that is inconsistent with
your security clearance."

"I am a better border guard for understanding the people who cross my
border," Rao said. He heard his own voice: steady, contained,
Kethari. "I am more effective, not less."

"Effectiveness is not the concern. Loyalty is."

The word landed like a stone in still water. Loyalty. In Kethari:
resh-vashti. Literally: self-faithfulness. Loyalty, in the Kethari
conception, was fidelity to one's own identity, one's own culture,
one's own self-sufficiency. To be loyal was to be impervious. To be
influenced was to be disloyal.

Rao thought about the Sulai word for loyalty: nal-reshvi. Faithfulness
to the web. Fidelity not to the self but to the connections that
sustained the self. In Sulai, loyalty meant holding the web. In
Kethari, loyalty meant standing alone.

"My loyalty is to my duty," Rao said. "My duty is to guard the
border. I guard it better when I understand both sides of it."

"That is not your determination to make."

They offered him a choice. He could surrender the text, discontinue
all Sulai language study, submit to a period of ideological
re-evaluation, and be returned to duty with a notation in his file.
Or he could refuse, in which case he would be discharged from the
Border Service and referred to the Security Directorate for further
assessment.

Rao thought about Tesshen. He thought about the nal-mesh sitting on
his shelf, small and heavy, full of words that described a way of
being that he had not known existed until a year ago and that he now
could not unimagine. He thought about the veshani — confiscated,
x-rayed, filed in a drawer. A gift turned into evidence. A connection
turned into a crime.

"May I have one day to consider?" he asked.

They gave him one day.

                              X.

He drove back to Checkpoint Seven. He stood at the guard station
window. The escarpment fell away below him, and the forest spread
beneath, and the evening light was doing what it always did — painting
the thornland purple and the forest gold and the cliff face between
them the color of old blood.

He thought about borders.

The Partition, nine hundred years ago, had not been a war. It had been
a philosophical disagreement. One faction of the people of Pashan had
believed that the highest form of existence was individual sufficiency;
the other had believed it was interconnection. They had argued. They
had debated. They had grown apart. And one day, the faction that would
become the Kethari had climbed the escarpment and settled the thornland,
and the faction that would become the Sulai had remained in the forest,
and the Wound That Does Not Close had opened between them.

Nine hundred years. Long enough for languages to diverge. Long enough
for customs to crystallize. Long enough for the memory of shared origin
to fade into myth, then into ideology, then into the simple, brutal
conviction that the people on the other side were fundamentally,
irreducibly other.

And now, for the first time in centuries, the wound was being probed.
Trade delegations. Language studies. An old scholar sitting on the
escarpment at sunset, teaching a young guard to hear the world in a
different frequency.

Rao picked up the nal-mesh from his shelf. He opened it to the passage
he had been reading the night before. It was from the section on
borders — because of course the Sulai, too, had thought about borders,
had written about them, had struggled with the question of where the
self ended and the other began.

"The border is not a wall," the passage read. "The border is a wound.
It marks the place where something was torn apart. To guard a wound is
not the same as guarding a wall. A wall is maintained. A wound is
healed. To guard a wound is to watch it, and to watch it is to see the
flesh on both sides, and to see the flesh on both sides is to know
that it was once one flesh, and to know that it was once one flesh is
to grieve, and to grieve is the beginning of healing."

Rao closed the book. He stood at the window for a long time. The
stars came out — first one, then a dozen, then the full blazing canopy
of the Pashan night sky, the same stars that shone on both sides of
the escarpment, the same light falling on thornland and forest alike.

He made his decision.

In the morning, he drove to headquarters. He entered the intelligence
office. He sat in the chair across from the Major and the Security
Directorate officers.

"I will not surrender the text," he said. "I will not discontinue my
studies. I will accept discharge."

The Major looked at him with an expression that might have been pity
or might have been contempt.

"You understand that this notation will follow you. Employment in any
government service will be extremely difficult. The Security Directorate
will monitor your activities."

"I understand."

"May I ask why?"

Rao thought about how to answer. He could have spoken in Kethari, in
the language of individual choice and self-determination, and framed
his decision as an exercise of resh-atu — I am sufficient in myself,
and I choose this path. He could have spoken in Sulai, in the language
of connection and obligation, and framed it as an act of nal-reshvi —
faithfulness to the web that Tesshen had begun to weave between them.

He chose a third option. He spoke in both languages, a sentence that
existed in neither Kethari nor Sulai alone but in the space between
them, the space that a border guard occupies, the space where the land
remembers.

"Resh-atu nal-veshuri," he said. "I am sufficient because I am
connected."

The officers stared at him. The phrase was a grammatical impossibility
— a Kethari word joined to a Sulai word by a logic that neither
language recognized. It was a sentence that could not exist. A border
crossing in language itself.

Rao stood. He placed his sidearm on the table. He placed his
identification card beside it. He walked out of the intelligence
office, down the corridor, out of the building, into the amber light
of the Kethari morning.

He drove to Checkpoint Seven. He packed his few possessions: the
nal-mesh, his dictionary, his grammar guide, the clothes on his back.
He stood in the guard station for the last time and looked through the
window at the escarpment and the forest beyond.

Then he walked to the switchback path, the one that descended the
cliff face in forty-seven hairpin turns, and he began to walk down.

He did not know what he would find at the bottom. He did not know if
the Sulai would accept a Kethari who had chosen exile. He did not know
if Tesshen would be there, or Mehani, or anyone who remembered a young
border guard who had tried, clumsily and against all regulations, to
learn their language.

He knew only this: the border was a wound, and he had spent his life
guarding it, and now he was going to see if it could heal.

He descended. The thornland fell away above him. The forest rose below.
The path switched back and forth across the cliff face, carved into
stone by Sulai engineers four centuries ago, maintained by no one since,
crumbling in places, solid in others. He put one foot in front of the
other. The air grew warmer, wetter, thicker. The sounds changed: the
thin wind of the plateau gave way to the dense, layered cacophony of
the forest — insects, birds, the creak of enormous trees, the distant
murmur of water.

He reached the bottom. He stood at the edge of the forest. The canopy
rose above him, vast and green and alive, and somewhere in its depths,
a veshani sang — the first creature to notice when a stranger entered
the forest.

Rao listened. He stepped forward. The forest closed around him, and
the border, behind him, remained: the Wound That Does Not Close, the
Place Where the Land Remembers.

But the land, Rao thought, remembers more than wounds. It remembers,
also, the time before the wound. The time when the flesh was whole.

He walked into the forest, carrying both languages inside him like two
rivers flowing toward the same sea, and the veshani sang, and the
border behind him was exactly what it had always been — a line on the
ground, a crack in the rock, a word in two languages that meant two
different things and, if you listened carefully enough, the same thing.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                  DISPATCHES FROM A FABRICATED FRONT

                         by Franklin Hoyt

================================================================================

                              I.

The first fabricated atrocity arrived on Marcus Cole's desk at 0914 on a
Monday morning, embedded in a classified intelligence digest between a
fuel consumption report and a personnel transfer memo. It was a
photograph — high resolution, digital enhancement, full color — showing
the aftermath of a nerve agent attack on a civilian settlement on the
Vestan moon of Callinda. Bodies in the streets. Children among them. The
chemical signature, according to the attached analysis, was consistent
with Compound Theta-7, a proscribed weapon in the arsenal of the
Hegemony of Outer Worlds.

Cole studied the photograph for four minutes. He was a journalist. He
had been a journalist for twenty-three years, first for the D.C.
Register, then for the Associated Interplanetary Press, and now for the
Terran Broadcasting Authority, where he held the title of Senior
Correspondent, Inner Worlds Bureau. He had covered three wars, two
coups, and an assassination. He had developed, over those twenty-three
years, a professional instinct for photographs that were not what they
appeared to be.

This photograph was not what it appeared to be.

He could not say, precisely, what was wrong with it. The bodies were
convincing. The chemical residue patterns were consistent with nerve
agent deployment. The settlement architecture matched known Callinda
construction. But something in the composition — the angle of light,
the placement of bodies, the too-perfect framing of a child's hand
reaching toward an adult's — had the quality of arrangement. Not the
random chaos of actual atrocity, but the curated horror of atrocity
as spectacle.

He picked up the phone and called his editor, Judith Wren, at the TBA
headquarters in New York.

"Judith. The Callinda photographs. Where did they originate?"

"Military Intelligence. Declassified this morning for press
distribution. Every outlet has them. The Herald is running them above
the fold."

"They're staged."

A pause. "Based on what?"

"Based on twenty-three years of looking at photographs of dead people
and knowing the difference between the ones that happen and the ones
that are arranged."

"That's not evidence, Marcus. That's instinct."

"My instinct has a better track record than Military Intelligence's
evidence."

"We're not running a retraction of photographs we haven't published
yet. Publish the story, note the source, let the readers decide."

Cole hung up. He looked at the photographs again. He pulled up the
intelligence digest and read the accompanying text: the attack had
allegedly occurred on the settlement of Vashara, population six
thousand, on the night of March 14th. Compound Theta-7 had been
delivered by high-altitude dispersal. The Hegemony had denied
responsibility. The Terran Alliance had condemned the attack and was
considering "proportional response."

Proportional response. The phrase that preceded every escalation in
every war Cole had ever covered. A euphemism so polished by use that
it gleamed like a badge, reflecting nothing.

He did not publish the story. He booked a transport to Callinda.

                              II.

Callinda was a small moon — three hundred kilometers in diameter, no
atmosphere, domed settlements connected by pressurized rail. It
occupied a strategic position in the asteroid corridor between the
inner and outer worlds, which made it valuable, and it had a civilian
population of forty thousand, which made it expendable. This was the
arithmetic of the war: value minus population equaled target.

Cole arrived at the main dome, Callinda Prime, forty-six hours after
leaving Earth. He showed his press credentials — TBA, all-theater
access, military escort required — and was assigned a Public Affairs
officer named Captain Polk, a young woman with a clipboard and a smile
that never reached her eyes.

"Mr. Cole. Welcome to Callinda. We'll be happy to facilitate your
coverage of the Vashara incident."

"I'd like to visit the site."

"Of course. We have a press tour scheduled for tomorrow. Eight
correspondents, military escort, full access to the affected area."

"I don't want a press tour. I want independent access."

The smile tightened. "Independent access to an active chemical
contamination zone is not possible at this time. The area is being
decontaminated. For your safety—"

"Captain. I've covered chemical attacks on three worlds. I have my own
protective equipment. I want independent access, or I want an on-the-
record explanation of why I can't have it."

The smile disappeared. "I'll check with the colonel."

Cole waited in the press room — a converted storage bay with folding
tables, wall-mounted screens showing TBA and competing network feeds,
and a coffee machine that produced a substance bearing only a
theoretical relationship to coffee. Three other correspondents were
there: Brin Hadley from the Herald, Mara Solano from Independent
Interplanetary, and a young freelancer named Tomás Anguiano who was
filing for half a dozen small outlets and looked like he hadn't slept
in days.

"You here for the Vashara story?" Hadley asked. He was a thick man with
a red face and the confidently incurious manner of a correspondent who
had long ago stopped questioning his sources.

"I'm here to look at it," Cole said.

"We've all looked at it. The photographs are devastating. My piece runs
tomorrow. 'Horror at Vashara: Hegemony's Chemical War on Civilians.'
Above the fold, full color."

"Did you go to the site?"

"Press tour is tomorrow."

"Did you verify the photographs independently?"

Hadley frowned. "They came from Military Intelligence. They're verified."

Cole said nothing. He drank his coffee. He watched the wall-mounted
screens. On TBA, a commentator was discussing the Vashara photographs
with the grave, controlled outrage that was the standard register for
atrocity coverage. On the Herald feed, an analyst was drawing circles
on a map of Callinda, explaining the strategic implications of chemical
weapon use in the asteroid corridor. On Independent Interplanetary,
Solano's network, a panel of experts debated the appropriate level of
Terran response.

No one questioned the photographs.

Cole waited. Captain Polk returned.

"The colonel has approved independent access. You will be accompanied
by a military escort for safety purposes only. The escort will not
restrict your movement or your reporting. Departure at 0600 tomorrow."

"Thank you, Captain."

She left. Cole sat in the press room and thought about the photograph
on his desk in New York. The child's hand reaching toward the adult's.
The angle of light. The composition that was too perfect to be real.

He thought about another photograph, from another war: the famous image
from the New Adelaide bombardment, twelve years ago, that had turned
public opinion against the Hegemony and justified the first major
Terran military deployment to the outer worlds. That photograph had
also been too perfect. And it had also been real. The bodies in it had
been actual bodies. The suffering had been actual suffering. But the
framing, the angle, the lighting — those had been chosen. A
photographer had stood among the dead and composed a shot.

Was that fabrication? Or was it journalism?

Cole did not sleep well.

                              III.

The rail car delivered him to Vashara at 0700, through a landscape of
gray rock and black sky that looked like the surface of a nightmare.
His escort was a Sergeant Okonkwo, a quiet man who carried his rifle
with the habitual ease of someone who had carried it for years and
hoped never to use it.

Vashara was a secondary dome, smaller than Callinda Prime, connected
by a single rail line. As they approached, Cole could see the dome
intact — no structural damage, no breach, no external evidence of
attack. The nerve agent, if it had been deployed, would have been
introduced through the ventilation system. No visible scars.

Inside the dome, the settlement was empty. The population had been
evacuated to Callinda Prime three days after the attack. What remained
were the streets, the buildings, the infrastructure of a small community
frozen in the moment of its abandonment: doors left open, vehicles
parked at curbs, a market stall with produce still on the counter,
desiccated now, turning to dust in the recycled air.

And the chemical residue. Cole's suit sensors detected traces of an
organophosphate compound — consistent with Compound Theta-7, consistent
with the intelligence report. The traces were concentrated in the
central plaza, exactly where the photographs had shown the bodies.

Cole walked the plaza. He studied the residue patterns. He photographed
everything: the streets, the buildings, the residue, the abandoned
market stall, the empty settlement stretching away in every direction
under the dome's artificial sky.

Sergeant Okonkwo followed at a respectful distance.

"Sergeant. How many casualties?"

"Official count is three hundred forty-seven dead, six hundred
twelve hospitalized."

"And the bodies were removed when?"

"Two days after the attack. Before the press was notified."

"Before the press was notified," Cole repeated.

"Standard protocol. Chemical contamination zone. Bodies had to be
removed for decontamination and identification."

"So the photographs of the bodies in the plaza were taken during the
removal process?"

"I wouldn't know about the photographs, sir."

Cole stood in the empty plaza. The chemical residue was real. The
empty settlement was real. Three hundred forty-seven people had died
here — that was, presumably, also real, though he had not yet verified
it independently. But the photographs — the photographs that were
driving the news cycle, that were being published above the fold, that
were shaping public opinion and justifying "proportional response" —
those photographs showed bodies arranged in the plaza in a way that
suggested they had died there, in the open, in the street, reaching
for each other, in postures of agony and supplication.

Nerve agent did not work that way. Cole had covered nerve agent attacks.
The victims did not die in the street, reaching for each other. They
died where they were when the agent reached them: in their homes, in
their beds, on the floor of the bathroom where they had crawled trying
to reach water. Nerve agent deaths were ugly, private, undramatic. They
did not make good photographs.

The photographs had been staged. The bodies had been real — Cole did
not doubt that people had died here — but they had been moved,
positioned, arranged to create an image of atrocity that was more
photogenic than the actual atrocity.

The truth had been replaced by a more compelling version of itself.

He filed no story. He took the rail back to Callinda Prime and began
making calls.

                              IV.

It took him three weeks. Three weeks of encrypted communications,
back-channel contacts, off-the-record conversations with intelligence
officers who owed him favors and military personnel who had consciences
they couldn't entirely suppress. Three weeks of assembling a picture
that he wished, with increasing fervor, he had never started assembling.

The Callinda photographs had been staged by the Terran Alliance Military
Intelligence Division, using real bodies from a real chemical attack, to
create images more suitable for public consumption. This was confirmed
by two independent sources within Military Intelligence itself.

But the chemical attack had been real. Three hundred forty-seven people
had actually died. The Hegemony had actually deployed Compound Theta-7.
The atrocity was genuine. Only its documentation was fabricated.

Cole sat in his quarters at Callinda Prime and stared at his notes and
tried to understand why this mattered. People had died. The Hegemony
had killed them. The photographs, though staged, depicted something
that had actually happened. What was the harm in making the truth more
visible? More legible? More likely to produce the outrage that the
truth deserved?

He knew the answer. He had always known the answer. It was the answer
that every journalist learned in their first year and spent the rest
of their career trying not to forget: the truth does not need to be
improved. The moment you arrange the bodies for the camera, the
moment you choose the angle that maximizes horror, the moment you
compose the shot — you have crossed a line, and on the other side of
that line, everything is negotiable. If you can stage the documentation
of a real atrocity, you can stage the documentation of a fake one. The
principle is identical. Only the bodies change.

He began writing his exposé.

And then the second set of photographs arrived.

                              V.

These came not from Military Intelligence but from an independent
journalist — a Hegemony-based correspondent named Yuki Tanizaki, who
had been covering the war from the other side. Tanizaki had smuggled a
data package to Cole through three intermediaries and a dead drop on a
neutral station.

The photographs showed the aftermath of a Terran orbital bombardment of
a Hegemony settlement on Ceres. Civilian casualties. Children among
them. The images were devastating: buildings reduced to rubble, bodies
in the wreckage, a woman clutching a dead infant.

Cole studied them with the same professional eye he had applied to the
Callinda photographs. And he saw the same thing: arrangement.
Composition. The too-perfect framing of horror. Bodies positioned for
maximum emotional impact. The woman with the dead infant placed in the
center of the frame, lit from the side, her face a mask of grief so
perfectly captured that it looked like a painting.

Staged. By the Hegemony, this time. Using real bodies from a real
bombardment to create fabricated documentation of an atrocity that had
actually occurred.

He called Tanizaki.

"Yuki. The Ceres photographs."

"I know what you're going to say."

"They're staged."

"Yes. The Hegemony Information Ministry arranged them. I've confirmed
it with two sources inside the Ministry."

"But the bombardment was real."

"Two hundred ninety dead. Real bombardment. Real dead. Staged
photographs."

Cole sat in the silence of his quarters and felt the ground shifting
beneath him. Both sides. Both sides of the war were fabricating
documentation of atrocities that were real. Both sides were taking
actual horror and reshaping it into more effective propaganda. Both
sides had concluded that reality, though terrible enough, was not
terrible in the right way — not photogenic enough, not narratively
coherent enough, not sufficiently composed for the consumption of a
public that had been trained, by decades of media, to expect its
atrocities to look a certain way.

"There's something else," Tanizaki said. "I've been comparing the
fabricated photographs from both sides. The staging techniques are
identical."

"What do you mean, identical?"

"Same compositional principles. Same lighting choices. Same body
positioning. The Callinda photographs and the Ceres photographs could
have been staged by the same team. They weren't — I've confirmed that
the Terran staging was done by Military Intelligence and the Hegemony
staging was done by the Information Ministry, with no coordination
between them. But the techniques are identical. As if both sides
learned propaganda from the same textbook."

"They did," Cole said. "It's called 'The History of War Photography.'
Every military academy in the system teaches it."

                              VI.

He wrote the story. It took him four days. He wrote it in the careful,
precise, documentary prose that he had developed over twenty-three years
of journalism — a prose style that presented facts in sequence, drew
connections without editorializing, and allowed the reader to arrive
at conclusions that the writer had already reached but would not state
directly.

The story laid out both fabrications side by side. The Callinda
photographs, staged by Terran Military Intelligence. The Ceres
photographs, staged by the Hegemony Information Ministry. Both using
real bodies from real attacks. Both creating fictional documentation of
factual events. Both employing identical techniques to transform the
ugly randomness of actual war into the composed, legible, consumable
horror that the public expected.

He sent the story to Judith Wren.

She called him back within the hour.

"Marcus. This is extraordinary. And I can't publish it."

"Why not?"

"Because both sets of photographs have already been published. The
Callinda photographs ran above the fold in every Terran outlet three
weeks ago. The Ceres photographs ran in every Hegemony outlet last week.
Public opinion on both sides has already been shaped. If we publish your
story now, we don't correct the record. We undermine it."

"Undermining a false record is the definition of journalism."

"The record isn't false. The atrocities are real. Your story doesn't
say the attacks didn't happen. It says the photographs were staged. Do
you understand what happens when you tell a public that has been
mobilized by photographs of dead children that the photographs were
staged? They don't think, 'The photographs were staged but the atrocity
was real.' They think, 'The whole thing was fake.' You will not correct
the propaganda. You will create a new propaganda — the propaganda of
doubt. And doubt, in wartime, is more dangerous than any lie."

Cole gripped the edge of his desk. "So we publish nothing."

"I didn't say that. I said I can't publish it. Not now. Not like this.
Give me something I can publish — context, analysis, a broader piece
about propaganda in wartime. Not the raw exposé. Not while the bodies
are still warm."

"The bodies are always warm, Judith. That's the problem. There's never
a moment when the bodies are cool enough for the truth."

"Marcus—"

"I'll file the piece with or without TBA's byline."

Silence.

"If you file independently, you'll burn your sources, your access, and
your career. Military Intelligence will revoke your credentials. The
Hegemony will expel Tanizaki. And the story will be dismissed as the
ravings of a disgruntled correspondent with an axe to grind."

"And if I don't file it?"

"Then the photographs stand. Both sets. As the official record of this
war."

Cole stared at the wall of his quarters. On the screen, a news feed
was running footage of the Terran Senate debating "proportional
response" to the Vashara attack. A senator was holding up the Callinda
photographs — the staged ones — and saying, "This is what we are
fighting against. This is what we must respond to."

The photographs were real and false at the same time. The atrocity they
depicted had happened. The way they depicted it had not. And the
senator holding them up did not know the difference, and would not care
if he did, because the photographs served his purpose, and purpose, in
wartime, was the only truth that mattered.

                              VII.

Cole filed the piece independently. He sent it to every outlet that
would take it: the small independents, the academic journals, the
underground press networks that operated in the margins of the war
economy. He sent it to Tanizaki, who filed a corresponding piece from
the Hegemony side. They published simultaneously, a coordinated act of
journalism across enemy lines.

The response was exactly what Judith Wren had predicted.

The Terran Alliance Military Intelligence Division revoked Cole's press
credentials. The Hegemony expelled Tanizaki. Both governments issued
statements denying the staging allegations. The mainstream press —
with a few honorable exceptions — declined to cover the story, not
because they doubted its accuracy but because covering it would require
acknowledging that they had published staged photographs without
verification.

The independent outlets that ran the story were flooded with responses:
some grateful, some furious, most confused. The public, as Wren had
predicted, did not draw the nuanced conclusion that the atrocities
were real but the photographs were staged. They drew one of two simpler
conclusions: either the whole thing was fake and the war was based on
lies, or the story was enemy propaganda designed to undermine morale.
The nuanced middle ground — that real atrocities had been cosmetically
enhanced for public consumption — was too uncomfortable for most people
to occupy.

Cole watched the aftermath from his quarters on Callinda, where he was
now stranded without credentials or passage. He watched his story
ripple through the media ecosystem, watched it distorted and
weaponized and turned into exactly the thing he had tried to expose:
propaganda. His truth became someone else's lie. His exposé became a
tool for the very forces he had tried to hold accountable.

And the war continued.

                              VIII.

On the fourteenth day after publication, Cole received a communication
from Tanizaki. It was brief.

"Marcus. I've found something else. The unreported atrocities."

Cole read the attached file. It was a compilation of verified reports
— not photographs, not staged documentation, but verified first-person
accounts, medical records, refugee testimony — of atrocities committed
by both sides that had never been reported at all. Not fabricated.
Not staged. Simply suppressed.

A Terran bombardment of a Hegemony hospital ship. Eighty-seven dead,
including patients and medical staff. Unreported.

A Hegemony nerve agent attack on a Terran mining colony. One hundred
twelve dead. Unreported.

A Terran ground assault on a Hegemony settlement in which retreating
soldiers executed forty-three prisoners. Unreported.

A Hegemony raid on a Terran supply convoy in which civilian transport
ships were fired upon. Two hundred eight dead, including children.
Unreported.

The file went on. Pages of it. Atrocity after atrocity, committed by
both sides, documented in the flat clinical language of military
reports and medical records, never released to the press, never
photographed, never staged, never used as propaganda, because they
did not fit the narrative that either side wished to project.

And here was the detail that made Cole set down the file and stare at
the wall for a long time: the unreported atrocities were, in almost
every case, worse than the fabricated ones. The real, unseen, suppressed
horror of the war exceeded the staged, publicized, propagandized
horror by orders of magnitude. Both sides had fabricated atrocities to
justify escalation, and both sides had suppressed atrocities that were
worse than anything they had fabricated, because the real atrocities
implicated both sides equally and served no one's narrative.

The fabricated photographs showed dead children in artfully arranged
poses. The suppressed reports described dead children in language so
clinical that it took a moment to understand that the words "pediatric
casualties" meant the same thing.

Cole sat in his quarters and understood, with the clarity of a man who
has reached the bottom of something, that the relationship between
truth and war was not what he had thought it was.

He had thought that truth was the opposite of propaganda. That the
journalist's job was to strip away the lies and reveal the reality
beneath. But the reality beneath was this: both sides fabricated
atrocities that were less terrible than the atrocities they actually
committed. The lies were milder than the truth. The propaganda was
gentler than the reality. The staged photographs, with their artful
composition and their carefully positioned bodies, were a sanitized
version of a war that was, in its actual conduct, far uglier than
anything either side dared to show its public.

War was always worse than anyone admitted. The fabrications were not
exaggerations. They were understatements. They were the version of
horror that both sides considered acceptable for public consumption —
and the fact that even this sanitized version was enough to mobilize
populations and justify escalation told you everything you needed to
know about the distance between what war actually was and what the
public was willing to see.

                              IX.

He wrote the second piece. He wrote it not as journalism but as
testimony — a first-person account of what he had found, what it meant,
and why it mattered. He wrote it knowing that it would be dismissed,
distorted, weaponized, turned into propaganda, the same way the first
piece had been. He wrote it anyway, because the alternative was silence,
and silence was complicity, and he had spent twenty-three years as a
journalist refusing to be complicit.

The piece ended with the unreported atrocities, listed one after another
in the flat language of the military reports, without commentary,
without interpretation, without photographs. Just words. Dates.
Numbers. The names of settlements and ships and units. The word
"casualties" repeated until it lost all meaning and then, slowly,
regained it.

He sent it to every outlet that would take it. He sent it to Tanizaki,
who filed a corresponding piece. He sent it to Judith Wren, who read
it and called him.

"This time," she said quietly, "I'll publish it."

"Why?"

"Because the photographs don't matter anymore, Marcus. After your first
piece, nobody trusts photographs. The only thing left is words. And
words are what you do."

The piece ran in TBA the following morning. Tanizaki's corresponding
piece ran in Hegemony outlets. For the first time in the war, the same
verified atrocities — committed by both sides, suppressed by both sides
— were published simultaneously to both publics.

The response was not outrage. It was not mobilization. It was not the
bright, hot anger that the staged photographs had produced.

It was silence.

A deep, exhausted, nauseated silence, spreading across both sides of
the war like a stain. The silence of people confronting the fact that
their own governments had committed atrocities and hidden them. The
silence of people realizing that the enemy's crimes, terrible as they
were, did not excuse their own. The silence that falls when the
distinction between "our side" and "their side" begins, slowly, to
dissolve.

It was not enough to stop the war. Nothing, Cole knew, would be enough
to stop the war, because war was not a problem that journalism could
solve. War was a condition, like gravity. You could document it,
measure it, describe its effects with perfect accuracy, and it would
continue to pull everything down.

But the silence mattered. It was a different kind of silence from the
silence of suppression. It was the silence of people thinking. And
thinking, however inadequate, however late, however unlikely to change
anything — thinking was what Cole's work had always been for.

He sat in his quarters on Callinda. Through the dome, the stars shone
on the gray surface of the moon, indifferent and cold. Somewhere out
in the dark between the worlds, the war continued — ships firing,
soldiers dying, atrocities committed and documented and staged and
suppressed and fabricated and real, the whole machinery of organized
violence grinding on.

Cole opened a new file. He began to write.

He had no credentials. He had no access. He had no byline, no
institutional backing, no guarantee that anything he wrote would be
published or read or believed.

He wrote anyway.

A journalist without credentials was still a journalist. A truth
without an audience was still the truth. And a war that was worse than
anyone admitted was still a war that someone had to describe, honestly,
without arrangement, without composition, without the careful staging
that made horror legible and palatable and useful.

The words went down on the page, plain and clear and unadorned, and
they said what the photographs could not say and the propaganda refused
to say and the military reports said only in the clinical language of
"casualties" and "collateral damage":

That people died. That they suffered. That the suffering was real, and
did not require staging, and could not be improved by arrangement, and
would not be diminished by suppression, and was, in the end, the only
truth about war that mattered.

He wrote it down. He sent it out. The silence continued.

Somewhere, someone was thinking.

That would have to be enough.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       LULLABY FOR A DYING STAR

                        by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                              I.

The star was designated KIC 9832410 in the Kepler catalog and had no
other name. It was a red supergiant, eleven solar masses, located in
the constellation Cygnus at a distance of approximately 6,340 light-
years from Earth. Its luminosity had been declining at an accelerating
rate for the past eighteen months, and the spectroscopic data were
unambiguous: core collapse was imminent. Within a year — perhaps less —
KIC 9832410 would undergo gravitational implosion, followed by a
Type II supernova explosion that would briefly outshine every other
star in its galaxy.

Dr. Elara Voss watched the data scroll across her terminal in the
observation bay of the Kepler Deep Field Station, a research platform
in a stable orbit at the Earth-Sun L2 point, 1.5 million kilometers
from home. The observation bay was a transparent hemisphere, three
meters in diameter, mounted on the station's sunward side, and through
it the stars burned with the hard, steady brilliance that only vacuum
could provide. Cygnus was not visible from this angle — the station's
orientation placed it behind the solar shield — but Voss did not need
to see the star directly. The data were sufficient. The data were, in
fact, more eloquent than direct observation, because the data captured
what the eye could not: the subtle dimming, the shifting spectral
lines, the neutrino flux that betrayed the convulsive nuclear reactions
in the star's core as it burned through the last of its fuel.

KIC 9832410 was dying.

It had been dying for a long time, in the way that all massive stars
die: profligately, extravagantly, burning through its hydrogen in a
few million years instead of the billions that a smaller, more prudent
star would manage. It had been born in a nebula, burned hot and blue
in its youth, swelled to red supergiant status in its middle age, and
was now, in its final months, consuming the last elements in its core
— silicon, sulfur, magnesium — in a sequence of increasingly desperate
fusion reactions, each one producing less energy and lasting a shorter
time, like a fire burning through progressively less combustible fuels.

When the core reached iron, the fusion would stop. Iron could not be
fused to produce energy. The core would collapse under its own gravity
in less than a second, the outer layers would rebound, and the star
would explode.

Voss had been monitoring KIC 9832410 for eleven months. She was thirty-
eight years old, an astrophysicist specializing in late-stage stellar
evolution, and this was the closest pre-supernova red supergiant that
had been identified during her career. It was, from a scientific
standpoint, an extraordinary opportunity: real-time observation of a
stellar death, with modern instruments, at a distance close enough to
resolve fine structure in the neutrino emissions and gravitational wave
signatures.

It was also, from a standpoint that Voss did not discuss with her
colleagues, unbearably sad.

She was aware that this was an irrational response. KIC 9832410 was a
ball of plasma, eleven times the mass of the Sun, with no consciousness,
no feelings, no awareness of its own existence or its impending end. It
was not dying in any meaningful sense; it was undergoing a physical
process, as impersonal as the cooling of a stone. To feel sadness at a
star's collapse was anthropomorphism of the most elementary kind.

And yet.

She watched the spectral lines shift and thought about what a star was.
A sustained nuclear explosion, held together by gravity, converting
hydrogen to helium to carbon to oxygen to silicon to iron in a chain
that proceeded, link by link, toward the inevitable conclusion. Each
element heavier than the one before. Each fusion stage shorter. The star
was a clock, counting down in elements, and the count had nearly reached
its end.

She thought about the planets.

                              II.

KIC 9832410 had planets. The Kepler data, supplemented by subsequent
observations, had confirmed at least three bodies in orbit: a gas giant
at 5.2 AU, a rocky world at 1.1 AU, and a smaller rocky body at 0.7 AU.
The inner two were within what would have been, during the star's main
sequence phase, the habitable zone.

The habitable zone had migrated outward as the star expanded to
supergiant status, and the inner planets were now baked, their surfaces
molten, their atmospheres stripped. But during the star's main sequence —
a period of several million years — the rocky world at 1.1 AU had
orbited at a distance consistent with liquid water on its surface.

Several million years was not long. On Earth, life had taken roughly a
billion years to progress from simple chemistry to single-celled
organisms. Several million years was, in biological terms, barely
enough time to establish a stable chemical equilibrium, let alone
evolve complexity.

But "barely enough" was not "impossible." And Voss, who had spent her
career studying stars and had developed, against her better scientific
judgment, a habit of thinking about the planets that orbited them, could
not stop herself from running the calculations.

If life had emerged on the rocky world at 1.1 AU — if chemistry had
become biology in the brief window of habitability — then that life was
now dead. Or dying. The supergiant's expansion had moved the habitable
zone beyond the planet's orbit centuries or millennia ago. Any
biosphere that had developed would have been sterilized by the
increasing radiation long before the star reached its current state.

And if — a larger if, a wilder speculation — that life had developed
complexity? Intelligence? Civilization?

Then that civilization was gone. Gone before the star's death, killed
by the star's aging, extinguished by the slow, inexorable expansion of
the furnace that had given it life. A civilization born in the warmth
of a young star and killed by the bloating of an old one. A fire that
gave light and then, in giving too much light, consumed everything it
had illuminated.

Voss ran the calculations. She mapped the habitable zone migration. She
modeled the radiation flux at 1.1 AU through the star's evolutionary
stages. The numbers told a story: if life had existed, it had had
approximately 2.3 million years of habitability, followed by a
transition period of roughly 800,000 years during which conditions
deteriorated from clement to hostile, followed by sterilization as the
expanding star's luminosity exceeded the planet's capacity to radiate
waste heat.

2.3 million years. On Earth, 2.3 million years ago, Homo habilis was
chipping stone tools in the Rift Valley. In the time between the first
stone tool and the present, an entire stellar lifecycle had played out
around KIC 9832410. A star had been born, had burned, had grown old,
had expanded, had killed whatever lived in its warmth, and was now
preparing to explode.

And no one would ever know whether anything had lived there.

Voss stared at the spectral data. The neutrino flux was increasing.
The core was contracting. The clock was counting down.

She opened a new file on her terminal. She labeled it "Personal Notes"
and began to write.

                              III.

"Personal notes. Day 334 of monitoring KIC 9832410.

"The neutrino flux has increased by 12% over the past week, consistent
with the onset of silicon burning in the core. Silicon burning is the
penultimate stage of nucleosynthesis in a massive star. After silicon
comes iron, and after iron comes collapse. At current rates, I estimate
core collapse within four to six months.

"I have been thinking about the planets.

"I know that this is not science. The existence of life on the inner
rocky world is pure speculation, unsupported by any observational
evidence. The probability is low. The window of habitability was brief.
The conditions were marginal. By any rigorous assessment, the most
likely scenario is that KIC 9832410's planets are and have always been
barren — sterile rocks orbiting a star that is notable only for the
manner of its death.

"And yet I find that I cannot stop composing messages to them.

"Not scientific messages. Not the kind of transmission that SETI
protocols would sanction. Personal messages. Letters, really. Addressed
to beings who almost certainly do not exist, on a planet that is
certainly uninhabitable, orbiting a star that is about to explode.

"I write them in the evenings, after my shift, sitting in the
observation bay with the stars outside the hemisphere and the data
scrolling on my terminal. I write them by hand, in a notebook, because
the act of writing by hand feels more personal, more intimate, more
like communication and less like data entry.

"I have not sent any of them. They are not meant to be sent. Even if I
transmitted them at the speed of light, they would not arrive at KIC
9832410 for 6,340 years — long after the star had exploded, long after
any hypothetical civilization had been destroyed. The messages would
arrive at a supernova remnant, a shell of expanding gas and radiation,
and would pass through it unread.

"I write them anyway."

                              IV.

The first letter was the simplest.

"To anyone who might have lived on the second planet of KIC 9832410:

"I am writing to you from a small station orbiting a small star, 6,340
light-years from your home. I am an astrophysicist. I study the lives
and deaths of stars. Your star is dying.

"You almost certainly do not exist. The probability of life arising in
the brief habitable window of a massive star is low, and the probability
of that life developing the capacity to receive and interpret an
electromagnetic transmission is far lower. I am writing to no one.

"But I wanted you to know — if you existed, if you ever existed, if
some trace of you persists in the dust and radiation that your star
will scatter across the galaxy when it explodes — I wanted you to know
that you were seen. That from a great distance, someone looked at your
star and thought of you. That your existence, however brief, however
marginal, however cosmically insignificant, was not entirely unwitnessed.

"I know this is not enough. I know that witnessing is not the same as
helping. I know that a message arriving 6,340 years too late is not a
message at all, but a gesture — an empty, futile, human gesture,
directed at the void.

"I make it anyway.

"With respect and sorrow,
"Dr. Elara Voss
"Kepler Deep Field Station
"Earth-Sun L2"

She wrote it in her notebook and did not transcribe it into the station's
communication system. She closed the notebook and looked out through the
observation hemisphere at the stars. They burned, as they always burned,
with the indifference of nuclear physics, and she sat among them and
felt the particular loneliness of a person who has looked too long at
distances too large.

                              V.

The second letter was harder to write.

"To anyone who might have lived on the second planet of KIC 9832410:

"I have been thinking about what your civilization might have been like,
if it existed. This is an exercise in imagination, not science, and I
undertake it knowing that whatever I imagine will be wrong — shaped by
my own biology, my own culture, my own inability to conceive of minds
genuinely different from my own.

"But here is what I imagine.

"I imagine that you looked up at your star and felt warmth. That the
light on your world was redder than the light on mine — your star was
always cooler, always larger in your sky, always more present than our
small yellow sun is in ours. I imagine that your art, if you had art,
was suffused with red. That your word for beauty, if you had words, was
connected to the color of your sky.

"I imagine that you noticed the changes. That over generations — your
generations, whatever their length — you observed that the star was
growing. That the warmth was increasing. That the seasons were shifting.
I imagine that you had scientists, or the equivalent of scientists:
beings who measured and predicted and tried to understand. I imagine
that those scientists told you what was coming.

"I imagine that you could not prevent it.

"This is the thing I think about most, alone in this station with your
star's data on my screen: the helplessness. If you existed, if you
saw it coming, you could not stop it. You could not cool your star. You
could not shrink it. You could not reach another star in time — the
nearest would have been light-years away, and your window of
habitability was too brief to develop interstellar travel, assuming
such a thing is even possible for beings of your scale.

"You were trapped. Born in the warmth of a star that would kill you
with its warmth. Given a window of light and life, and then the window
closed, and there was nothing — nothing — you could do.

"I think about this, and I want to say something that will help. But
there is nothing to say that will help. There is nothing that can cross
6,340 light-years and arrive in time and be adequate to the situation.
There is no lullaby for a dying star. There is only the fact that
someone, very far away, thought of you. And that is not enough. And
it is all I have."

She set down her pen. Her hand was trembling. She had not noticed until
now that she was crying.

She closed the notebook.

                              VI.

Dr. Voss's colleague on the station was Dr. Ren Matsuda, a
cosmologist specializing in gravitational wave detection. Matsuda was
a reserved, methodical man of fifty-three who communicated primarily in
data sets and considered small talk an inefficient use of atmospheric
pressure. He and Voss had worked together for fourteen months, sharing
meals and shifts and the peculiar intimacy of two people isolated in
space, without ever quite becoming friends.

He found her in the observation bay on the 347th day of monitoring,
sitting with her notebook open and her pen still.

"Voss. The neutrino data for the past twenty-four hours needs your
sign-off."

"I'll get to it."

He looked at her. Matsuda was not skilled at reading faces — he
claimed this as a professional deficiency, like colorblindness or an
inability to carry a tune — but even he could see that something was
wrong.

"What are you writing?"

"Letters."

"To whom?"

"To the civilizations that might have existed around KIC 9832410."

Matsuda considered this. "There is no evidence of civilizations around
KIC 9832410."

"I know."

"The habitable window was approximately 2.3 million years. Insufficient
for complex life, by terrestrial analogy."

"I know."

"Your letters cannot be received. Even if transmitted, they would
arrive six thousand years after the star's death."

"I know, Ren."

He stood in the doorway of the observation bay, a silhouette against
the corridor light. Behind him, the station hummed with the sounds of
air recycling and power distribution and the faint, constant murmur of
a human structure maintaining itself against the vacuum.

"Then why are you writing them?"

Voss looked at him. She did not know how to explain. She did not know
how to describe the thing she felt when she looked at the data — the
spectral lines shifting, the neutrino flux climbing, the countdown in
elements proceeding inexorably toward iron. She did not know how to
articulate the weight of witnessing a death that she could not prevent,
at a distance she could not cross, involving beings who almost
certainly did not exist but whose hypothetical existence haunted her
with a grief that she could not rationalize away.

"Because someone should," she said.

Matsuda looked at her for a long time. Then he sat down in the chair
next to hers and looked out through the observation hemisphere at the
stars.

"Read me one," he said.

She read him the first letter. When she finished, the observation bay
was quiet. Matsuda sat with his hands folded in his lap, his face
illuminated by starlight, and said nothing for perhaps two minutes.

"The science is speculative," he said finally.

"Yes."

"The probability estimates are generous."

"Yes."

"You should transmit them."

Voss looked at him. "They'll arrive six thousand years too late."

"They'll arrive. That is the only variable that matters. Whether they
are received is a separate question from whether they are sent. You
cannot control reception. You can control transmission. The act of
sending a message is complete in itself. It does not require an
audience to have meaning."

"That's not physics, Ren. That's philosophy."

"I am a cosmologist. The distinction is narrower than you think."

                              VII.

She did not transmit them immediately. She wrote more letters first.

The third letter was about music. She imagined what music might sound
like on a world orbiting a red supergiant — lower frequencies,
perhaps, tuned to the deeper electromagnetic emissions of a cooler
star. She described human music. She tried to convey, in words, what a
Bach cello suite sounded like, knowing that the description was
hopeless, that no words in any language could transmit the experience
of music to a being that had never heard it.

The fourth letter was about loss. She wrote about the deaths of people
she had loved: her mother, who had died of cancer when Voss was
twenty-six; her thesis advisor, who had died in a lab accident; a
friend from graduate school who had simply stopped communicating one
day and was later found to have taken her own life. She wrote about the
inadequacy of grief — how it never seemed proportional to the loss,
how it arrived in waves of unpredictable force, how it diminished
without ever disappearing.

"I tell you about these losses," she wrote, "not because they are
comparable to the loss of a world. They are not. A mother's death is
not the death of a star. A friend's silence is not the silence of a
civilization. But they are the losses I know, and I offer them as
evidence — inadequate, partial, human evidence — that the universe
contains beings who understand what it means to lose. Who know what
it feels like to watch something precious diminish and be unable to
stop it. Who carry the weight of impermanence and are not crushed by
it. Not always. Not entirely."

The fifth letter was about the night sky. She described what the stars
looked like from Earth — the specific quality of starlight filtered
through atmosphere, the way constellations shifted with the seasons,
the ancient human habit of seeing patterns in the random distribution
of fusion reactors. She described the Milky Way as seen from a dark
site, the pale river of light that was actually a hundred billion stars
seen edge-on, and she described the vertiginous, magnificent,
terrifying feeling of comprehending, even briefly, the scale of it.

"Your star," she wrote, "is one of those points of light. From Earth,
it is a dot in Cygnus, indistinguishable from any other dot without a
telescope and a spectrograph. I have looked at it through both, and I
have seen it as it was 6,340 years ago — still burning, still bright,
still sustaining whatever it sustained in its warmth. The light I see
tonight left your star when, on Earth, human beings were just
beginning to build cities, to write, to record their own existence.
Your star's light has been traveling toward me for the entire span of
human civilization. It arrives, and I receive it, and I know that by
the time I see it, the star it came from is already in its death throes.

"The light is a message from the past. My letters are a message to the
future. Neither arrives in time. And yet both are sent, and both
travel, and both carry something across the void — not information,
exactly, but acknowledgment. The acknowledgment that something existed.
That something burned. That something gave light."

                              VIII.

On the 398th day of monitoring, the neutrino flux spiked.

Voss was in the observation bay when the alert came. She looked at the
data and felt her breath stop. The spike was sudden, massive, and
unmistakable: a burst of electron neutrinos at an intensity that could
only mean one thing. The core had reached iron. Silicon burning was
complete. Core collapse was beginning.

She activated the station's full sensor array. Every instrument they
had — neutrino detectors, gravitational wave interferometers,
electromagnetic spectrum analyzers across all wavelengths — oriented
toward the coordinates of KIC 9832410.

Matsuda arrived in the observation bay within minutes, already reading
the data on his portable terminal.

"Core collapse," he said. It was not a question.

"Core collapse," Voss confirmed.

They stood together in the observation bay and watched the data. The
neutrino flux climbed in a steep, exponential curve. The gravitational
wave detectors registered a growing signal — the signature of a
massive, dense object contracting at a significant fraction of the
speed of light. The electromagnetic data showed nothing yet; the light
from the explosion would take hours to reach the outer layers of the
star, and 6,340 years to reach their instruments. What they were seeing
was the neutrinos and gravitational waves, which traveled at or near
the speed of light and carried the news of the collapse before the
light itself could escape.

They were watching a star die in real time. Or rather, they were
watching the echo of a star that had died 6,340 years ago, the
signal traveling at the speed of light across the galaxy to deliver
the news with the maximum possible urgency and the maximum possible
delay.

"The supernova will be visible within the hour," Matsuda said.
"Magnitude estimate?"

Voss checked. "Apparent magnitude negative 4 to negative 6. Brighter
than Venus. Visible in daylight from Earth."

"A new star in Cygnus. The astronomers on Earth will go mad."

"Yes."

They watched the data. The neutrino flux peaked and began to decline
— the core had collapsed, the bounce had occurred, the shock wave was
propagating outward through the star's layers. In the core, a neutron
star was forming — or perhaps a black hole, depending on the final
mass. The outer layers were being hurled outward at thousands of
kilometers per second, a shell of incandescent gas expanding in every
direction, carrying with it the heavy elements forged in the star's
final moments: iron, nickel, cobalt, the ashes of a stellar lifetime.

Voss thought about the planets. The rocky world at 1.1 AU, already
baked, already sterilized, was about to be engulfed by the expanding
supernova remnant. Whatever remained of its surface — the geology, the
topography, the molecular traces of whatever chemistry or biology had
once existed there — would be vaporized, scattered, dispersed into the
interstellar medium.

The atoms that had been part of that world would become part of the
nebula. The nebula would, over millions of years, contract under
gravity and form new stars, new planets. The atoms that had been a
world would be recycled. Nothing would be truly lost; everything would
be transformed.

This was the standard consolation of astrophysics. It was true. It was
also, Voss felt, completely inadequate.

She picked up her notebook. She opened it to a blank page. She wrote
the last letter.

"To anyone who might have lived on the second planet of KIC 9832410:

"It is over now. Your star has collapsed. The light of the explosion
will reach your world — what remains of your world — in a few hours.
The shock wave will arrive after that. And then there will be nothing
left of the system you called home except an expanding cloud of gas
and a dense remnant at the center, spinning in the dark.

"I am watching it happen from very far away. I cannot help. I could
never have helped. The distance between us is too great, the time too
long, the physics too absolute. I am a small being on a small station
orbiting a small star, and I am writing to the memory of a world I
never knew existed, and I am crying, which is a thing that human
beings do when the distance between what they feel and what they can
do becomes unbearable.

"I have written you six letters. None of them will reach you. All of
them are inadequate. They do not contain solutions or salvation or even
particularly useful information. They contain only this: the news that
you were thought of. That your star's light was received, and measured,
and understood, and grieved. That a stranger, separated from you by
6,340 light-years and an indeterminate number of millennia, looked at
the data of your star's death and felt something that the data could
not contain.

"I do not know what to call this feeling. It is not grief, exactly,
because I do not know what I have lost. It is not love, because I do
not know whom I love. It is something else — something for which I
have no word, something that exists in the space between knowing that
the universe is vast and indifferent and feeling, despite that
knowledge, that it matters. That you mattered. That the light your
star gave, and the warmth it provided, and whatever brief, improbable,
magnificent thing might have flickered into existence in that warmth —
that all of it mattered, even though it is gone, even though it was
always going to be gone, even though nothing I do or say or write can
change that.

"This is my lullaby for your dying star. It is not a song. It has no
melody. It is just words, sent into the void, arriving too late, saying
only this:

"You were here. I know you were here. And I am sorry. And I will
remember."

She closed the notebook. The data on her terminal showed the neutrino
flux declining, the gravitational wave signal stabilizing, the first
faint electromagnetic signature of the supernova beginning to appear
in the X-ray band. In a few hours, a new star would blaze in Cygnus,
visible from Earth, a brief brilliant light that would fade over months
and leave behind a nebula and a remnant and the faintest possible trace
of everything that had been.

Matsuda was standing beside her. He had read the letter over her
shoulder. He said nothing. He placed his hand, briefly, on her
shoulder — a gesture so unusual from him that it carried the weight of
an entire vocabulary.

"Transmit them," he said.

Voss opened the station's communication system. She transcribed all
six letters into the transmission buffer. She set the coordinates for
KIC 9832410 — which was, now, a supernova, a blaze of light that would
be visible across the galaxy.

She pressed transmit.

The letters left the station at the speed of light, a stream of
electromagnetic pulses heading toward a dead star, carrying words
that would never be read, addressed to beings who almost certainly
had never existed, composed by a woman sitting in a small station at
the edge of the solar system who had done the only thing she could do,
which was also the only thing that mattered:

She had noticed. She had cared. She had said so.

The signal traveled outward. The star burned in its death. The
universe continued, vast and indifferent and full of light, and in a
small station at L2, a woman closed her notebook and wiped her eyes
and turned back to the data, because the data was her work, and her
work was the only answer she had to the silence between the stars.

It was not enough.

It was all there was.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                          GLASS CHILDREN

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                              I.

The first thing you noticed about a glass child was the light.

Not the transparency itself — you got used to that faster than you'd
expect, the way you got used to any other physical variation once you'd
seen enough of it. The skeletal structure, visible as a faint lattice
of mineral white. The organs, soft and dim, pulsing with the quiet
rhythms of respiration and circulation. The blood, moving through
vessels like red thread drawn through clear water. You got used to all
of it.

But the light. A glass child standing in sunlight became a prism. The
skin refracted and scattered the light in ways that ordinary flesh did
not, casting faint rainbows on nearby surfaces — walls, floors, the
faces of other children. In certain conditions, at certain angles, a
glass child seemed to glow from within, as if the body itself were a
lamp. Teachers in the early days of the modification had reported that
classrooms full of glass children were measurably brighter than
classrooms of opaque children, and that the light had a quality —
diffuse, warm, slightly pink from the hemoglobin — that people found
calming.

The Lumen modification had been introduced fourteen years ago, which
meant that the first generation of glass children was approaching
puberty. This was significant because the modification was designed to
be temporary: the transparent phase lasted from birth to approximately
age thirteen, at which point the genetically programmed melanin
activation would trigger, the skin would opacify over a period of
several months, and the child would become, visually, indistinguishable
from any other human being.

Unless they chose otherwise.

This was the question that had consumed public discourse for the past
two years, the question that had divided parents and ethicists and
politicians and the glass children themselves into camps that grew more
entrenched with each passing month: should the opacity trigger be
allowed to proceed? Or should it be suppressed — chemically, genetically,
permanently — allowing the glass children to remain transparent for
life?

The Clarity Movement said: suppress it. Transparency was not a phase to
be outgrown. It was an evolution to be embraced. A transparent humanity
would be a humanity without deception, without concealment, without the
thousand small and large dishonestries that opaque bodies enabled. You
could not lie if your heart rate was visible. You could not hide your
emotions if your adrenal glands could be seen flushing cortisol into
your bloodstream. You could not pretend to be calm while your stomach
churned with anxiety, or pretend to be strong while your muscles
trembled with fear. Transparency was truth. Opacity was the original
sin. The glass children were the future, and the future should not be
allowed to go dark.

The Privacy Compact said: allow it. Transparency was a violation of
the most fundamental human right: the right to an interior life. The
right to feel things without displaying them. The right to be afraid
without showing fear, to be angry without showing anger, to grieve
without performing grief. The body was not a window. The body was a
home, and a home required walls.

Mira Okafor-Renn, age twelve years and eleven months, was a glass
child. She was also the daughter of Dr. Adaeze Okafor, one of the
geneticists who had designed the Lumen modification, and of Thomas
Renn, a painter whose work explored themes of visibility and
concealment. She had been transparent for her entire life. She had
never known what it felt like to be opaque.

In twenty-seven days, her opacity trigger was scheduled to activate.

She had a choice to make.

                              II.

The school was in Portland, Oregon, a mid-century building with large
windows that the administration had installed specifically for the glass
children — the more natural light, the better the effect, and the
effect mattered, because the school was one of seven in the country
that served as mixed environments: glass children and opaque children
together, learning side by side, an experiment in coexistence that the
Department of Education monitored with the close attention of people
who were not entirely sure it would work.

Mira sat in her seat by the window and felt the morning sun pass
through her like water through a net. She could see — if she looked
down at her own arm resting on the desk — the faint shadow of her
radius and ulna, the branching network of blood vessels, the slow
flex of tendons as she moved her fingers. She had been seeing this her
entire life. It was as familiar to her as her own face in a mirror.
More familiar, actually, because her face she could only see reflected,
but her hands she could see from the inside.

Beside her, Joaquin Reyes — opaque, thirteen, her closest friend since
the third grade — was not looking at her. This was deliberate. Joaquin
had learned, over years of friendship, the etiquette of the glass: you
did not stare. You did not study. You treated a glass child's
transparency the way you treated any other physical characteristic —
you acknowledged it and moved on. The fact that you could see Mira's
heart beating did not mean you should watch it.

But today was different. Today, Mira could feel Joaquin not-looking
at her with the particular intensity of someone who was thinking about
looking, and she knew why.

"Twenty-seven days," she said.

"I wasn't going to bring it up."

"You were thinking about it."

"How do you know what I'm thinking? I'm opaque."

She smiled. "You fidget with your left thumb when you're thinking about
something you don't want to say. You've done it since fourth grade."

He looked down at his left hand. His thumb was, in fact, rubbing
against his index finger in the small, repetitive motion she'd
described. He stopped.

"That's not fair," he said. "I can't read you that way."

"You can read me better than that. You can see everything."

"That's different. Seeing your heart rate doesn't tell me what you're
feeling. It tells me you're feeling something. The actual content is
still yours."

"Is it?"

This was the question. This was always the question. The glass children
and their opaque peers had been having this conversation in various
forms since elementary school, and it never resolved, because it
depended on something that neither side could prove: whether visibility
and knowability were the same thing.

The Clarity Movement said yes. If your body was transparent, your
emotions were legible. Heart rate, respiration, galvanic response,
hormonal fluctuation — all of it was visible, all of it could be
interpreted, and therefore all of it was known. To be glass was to be
known. To be known was to be honest. To be honest was to be free.

Mira was not sure. She had spent twelve years in a transparent body,
and she had learned something that the Clarity Movement's theorists —
most of whom were opaque adults — did not seem to understand: that
visibility was not the same as comprehension. People could see her
heart beating faster when she was nervous, but they could not see why
she was nervous. They could see her adrenal glands activating, but
they could not distinguish between the adrenaline of fear and the
adrenaline of excitement. They could see her body's responses, but
the meaning of those responses — the thoughts, the memories, the
associations, the internal narrative that transformed a chemical event
into an emotional experience — remained invisible. Remained hers.

The body was transparent. The mind was not. And the Clarity Movement's
error — the error that Mira had been circling for months without quite
being able to articulate it — was the assumption that the body was the
mind. That if you could see all the machinery, you could understand the
machine. That transparency of flesh equaled transparency of self.

It did not. Mira knew this because she lived it. She was the most
visible person in any room, and she was also, in the ways that mattered
most, entirely hidden.

                              III.

Dr. Adaeze Okafor came home from the lab at 6:47 PM, which was early
for her. Mira, who had been sitting on the back porch watching the
evening light turn the garden into a Impressionist painting — opaque
objects casting solid shadows, her own shadow a faint, diffuse halo on
the boards — heard the car and felt a complex spike of emotions that
she was glad, for once, that no one was close enough to observe.

Her mother entered through the kitchen. Mira heard her set down her
bag, pour a glass of water, stand at the sink for a moment in the
silence that meant she was gathering herself. Then footsteps. The back
door. Her mother sat beside her on the porch.

Adaeze Okafor was fifty-one, opaque, with the composed bearing of a
woman who had spent her career manipulating the building blocks of life
and had developed a corresponding respect for the complexity of the
structures she modified. She had designed the Lumen modification with
a team of twelve geneticists, working under a research grant from the
NIH, with the stated goal of studying the developmental effects of
somatic transparency on social cognition. The stated goal. The real
goal — which Adaeze had acknowledged only in private, only to her
husband, only once — was more personal: she had wanted to see if
transparency could make people kinder.

The results were ambiguous.

"Dr. Vasher called," Adaeze said. "She wants to schedule the
suppression consultation."

The suppression consultation was the appointment at which Mira would
decide whether to receive the injection that would permanently suppress
her opacity trigger, keeping her transparent for life. The alternative
was to do nothing and allow the trigger to activate naturally, becoming
opaque over a period of three to six months.

"I know," Mira said.

"You don't have to decide now. You have time."

"Twenty-seven days."

"That's time."

"Is it?"

They sat on the porch. The evening light was fading. Mira's body, in
the dimness, was losing its daytime luminosity — the effect required
light to pass through, and in low light, a glass child looked less
transparent and more translucent, a figure seen through frosted glass,
the details softening into suggestion.

"Mom. Why did you make us?"

Adaeze looked at her daughter. Through her daughter, literally — she
could see the garden fence through Mira's torso, the pickets slightly
warped by the refraction of Mira's tissue.

"You know why. It's in every paper I've published."

"I know the scientific rationale. I'm asking the personal one."

Adaeze was quiet for a long time. A dog barked somewhere in the
neighborhood. The streetlights were coming on, and Mira's body caught
their sodium glow and scattered it in faint orange halos.

"When I was a girl," Adaeze said, "I was very good at hiding. Not
physically — emotionally. I could be in terrible pain and no one
would know. I could be furious, heartbroken, terrified, and my face
would show nothing. My mother called it 'strength.' My therapist, years
later, called it 'dissociation.' I spent twenty years learning to hide,
and then twenty more years learning to stop hiding, and by the time I
stopped, I had lost relationships, missed connections, failed to ask
for help when I needed it, because no one could see that I needed it,
because I had made sure they couldn't see."

She looked at her hands. Opaque hands. Hands that revealed nothing.

"I thought: what if children didn't have to learn to hide? What if
their bodies simply... showed? Not everything. Not their thoughts.
But their feelings. Their physical state. The truth of what was
happening inside them, visible to anyone who cared to look. I thought
it would make childhood safer. I thought adults would respond more
quickly to a child they could see was frightened, or in pain, or
overwhelmed. I thought transparency would be a kind of protection."

"Was it?"

"For some children, yes. The data show that glass children are
identified for mental health intervention earlier and more accurately
than opaque children. Teachers can see the physiological signs of
anxiety, depression, and trauma in real time. The early intervention
outcomes are significantly better."

"That's the data. I'm asking about me."

Adaeze reached out and took her daughter's hand. Through the clear
skin, she could see her own fingers as dark shapes beneath the
surface, the pressure points where their hands met creating small
white spots of blanched tissue.

"For you, I don't know. You've never told me whether it was a
protection or a burden. And I have always been afraid to ask."

"Because you designed it."

"Because I designed it, and because you are my daughter, and because
those two facts create a conflict that I have never been able to
resolve."

Mira looked at their joined hands — her mother's dark skin and her own
clear flesh, the two different ways of being in a body, touching.

"It's both," she said. "It's a protection and a burden and something
else that doesn't have a word yet. It's — it's like living in a house
with no walls. The light is beautiful. The air is good. Everyone can
see you, and sometimes that's safety and sometimes that's exposure, and
you never get to choose which one it is, because you can't put the
walls up. They were never there."

"And now you can choose to put them up."

"Yes."

"And you don't know if you want to."

"No. I don't know."

                              IV.

The Clarity Movement held its rallies in the open air, in parks and
plazas, under the sun. This was deliberate: their symbol was light
itself, and their gatherings were designed to showcase the beauty of
transparency, glass children moving through sunlight like living
stained-glass windows, refracting and scattering the light, turning
every rally into an impromptu light show.

Mira attended the rally in Pioneer Courthouse Square three weeks before
her trigger date. She went alone. Joaquin had offered to come, but she
had said no — she needed to see this without the filter of his opaque
presence, his solid shadow, his comfortable familiarity.

The square was full. Several hundred people, a mix of glass children,
opaque adults, and a contingent of young adults who were the first
wave — the earliest Lumen children, now nineteen and twenty years old,
who had chosen suppression at thirteen and had been living as permanent
glass adults for half a decade.

These adults were the movement's vanguard. They stood on the stage in
the center of the square, their bodies luminous in the afternoon sun,
and they spoke about what it meant to live transparent.

A young woman named Sola — twenty, West African descent, her dark
skeleton and organs a striking contrast to her clear skin, looking like
an anatomical illustration brought to life — took the microphone.

"I chose suppression when I was thirteen," Sola said. "I chose to stay
glass. And it was the hardest decision I have ever made, and it was
the best decision I have ever made. Not because transparency is easy.
It isn't. It is the hardest way to be a person. Every day, someone
looks at me and sees something I did not choose to show them. Every
day, someone reads my body and thinks they know what I'm feeling. Every
day, I am exposed in ways that opaque people cannot imagine.

"And that exposure is the point. Because when I am exposed, I cannot
lie. I cannot pretend. I cannot perform a self that is not my self. I
am only and always exactly what I am, visible and real, and the world
must deal with me as I am, not as I present myself. And the world —
slowly, clumsily, imperfectly — is learning to deal with that. And
that learning is making the world better."

The crowd applauded. Mira stood near the back and watched. Through the
crowd, she could see other glass children — some younger than her, some
near her age, all facing the same decision she faced. Their bodies
caught the light and threw it outward in soft prismatic halos, and the
square was full of rainbows, and it was beautiful, and Mira thought: yes.
This is beautiful. This is real. And it is not enough.

Because Sola's speech, for all its eloquence, contained the same elision
that the Clarity Movement always made: the assumption that visibility
and authenticity were the same thing. That to be seen was to be known.
That a body without walls was a self without masks.

Mira knew better. She had spent twelve years in a transparent body,
and she had learned that the self was not housed in the body the way
a person was housed in a building. The self was not a visible thing
that walls concealed. The self was an invisible thing that no amount
of transparency could reveal. You could strip away every layer of
concealment — skin, fat, muscle, bone — and you would find organs and
blood and the electrochemical fizz of a nervous system, and you would
know nothing. You would see everything and understand nothing, because
the self was not made of visible things.

The Clarity Movement wanted to end deception by making the body
transparent. But the body was not where deception lived. Deception
lived in the mind — in the stories people told about their visible
selves, in the interpretations they imposed on observable data, in
the vast, invisible, incalculably complex inner world that no
modification could make transparent, because it was not made of matter.
It was made of meaning. And meaning was, by its nature, opaque.

Mira left the rally. She walked home through streets dappled with
afternoon light, her body catching and scattering the sun, casting
faint rainbows on the sidewalk, visible to everyone, known to no one.

                              V.

Thomas Renn was in his studio. He painted in oils, large canvases,
and his current series — "The Visible Spectrum" — was a sequence of
portraits of his daughter at various ages, each one an attempt to
capture what it was like to see a person you loved from the inside
out.

The paintings were extraordinary. They had been exhibited at three
galleries and written about in Art in America. They showed Mira at
two, at five, at eight, at eleven — her body rendered in luminous
glazes that captured the quality of light passing through living
tissue, the faint shadows of bone, the subtle pulsing of organs.
They were beautiful and clinical and deeply personal, and Mira had
complicated feelings about them that she had never fully expressed.

She stood in the studio doorway and watched her father work. He was
painting her at twelve — the current portrait, the last in the series,
because after the trigger date, she would either be permanently glass
or on her way to opacity, and either way, the transitional quality he
was trying to capture — the quality of being on the threshold between
visibility and concealment — would be gone.

"Dad."

He looked up. Paint on his hands, his shirt, a smear across his
forehead where he'd pushed back his hair. Thomas Renn was opaque in
the way that certain people were opaque: solidly, comfortably,
unapologetically. He had never wished to be transparent. He had never
understood, not fully, what it was like. But he had spent twelve years
painting it, and the paintings showed more understanding than he could
put into words.

"Come see," he said.

She walked into the studio and looked at the portrait. It showed her
sitting on the back porch — the pose from the other evening, the
evening she had talked with her mother. The light was the sodium glow
of streetlights, and in the painting, her body was a translucent form
in the dimness, the details softened, the interior structures visible
but blurred, like a figure seen through water.

It was, she realized, a portrait of a person becoming invisible. The
low light diminished her transparency, made her more like an opaque
person, more like everyone else. In the painting, she was halfway
between glass and flesh, between visible and hidden, between the child
she had been and the person she might become.

"Is this what I look like to you?" she asked.

"This is what you look like at dusk," he said. "When the light is low
and you're not quite either thing."

"Which thing do you want me to be?"

He set down his brush. He looked at her — looked at her the way he
always looked at her, with the painter's eye that saw form and light
and color, and with the father's eye that saw something the painter's
eye could never capture.

"I want you to be whichever thing you are," he said. "Not which thing
is beautiful. Not which thing is politically correct. Not which thing
makes a better painting. Whichever thing is you."

"What if I don't know which thing is me?"

"Then that's your answer. If you don't know, don't choose. Let the
trigger do what it does. You'll have the experience of opacity. And if
opacity isn't you, there are reversal protocols. The choice isn't
permanent in either direction."

"The Clarity Movement says it should be. They say everyone should be
glass. That choice is the problem — that as long as opacity is an
option, people will choose it, and the whole project fails."

"The whole project of what? Ending deception? Mira, deception doesn't
live in the skin. I'm a painter. I know about surfaces. Surfaces can
be transparent or opaque, and they can lie either way. A glass person
can deceive you just as effectively as an opaque person — they just
have to be more creative about it. The body is not the self. The
surface is not the truth."

"That's what I've been trying to say."

"Then say it."

                              VI.

She said it. She said it at school, in Ms. Chen's social studies class,
during the unit on the Lumen Modification and Civil Liberties that was
part of the eighth-grade curriculum. The class was mixed — fourteen
glass children, eighteen opaque children — and the discussion had been
carefully structured by Ms. Chen to present both perspectives with
equal weight and respect.

But equal weight and respect was not what the discussion needed. What
the discussion needed, Mira decided, was honesty.

She raised her hand. Ms. Chen called on her.

"The Clarity Movement says transparency ends deception," Mira said.
"The Privacy Compact says transparency violates privacy. They're both
right. And they're both wrong. Because they're both talking about the
body, and the body is not where the important things happen."

The class was quiet. Thirty-two faces — some transparent, some opaque —
turned toward her.

"I've been glass my whole life. I've never had a body that hid anything.
You can see my heart beating right now. You can see that my hands are
shaking, because I'm nervous. You can see everything about my physical
state. And you know nothing about what I'm thinking. Nothing about what
I'm feeling. Because what I'm feeling is not my heart rate. It's not
my cortisol level. It's not any visible thing. It's the meaning I assign
to the visible things, and meaning is invisible. It's always invisible.
It's invisible in opaque people and it's invisible in glass people. No
modification can change that."

She paused. The room was very still.

"I'm going to let my trigger activate. I'm going to become opaque. Not
because I think opacity is better than transparency. Not because I want
to hide. But because I've spent twelve years being the most visible
person in every room, and I've learned something that the Clarity
Movement doesn't want to hear: being visible didn't make me known. It
made me legible. And legibility is not the same as knowledge.

"People looked at me and thought they understood me. They thought my
transparent body was a transparent self. It wasn't. It was a body. Just
a body. A container for something that cannot be contained, something
that has to be offered freely or not at all. The self is not something
you can see. It's something you choose to show. And that choice — the
choice of what to reveal and when and to whom — is not deception. It's
dignity."

She sat down. The class was silent. Ms. Chen, who had been trained to
maintain neutral facilitation, looked at Mira with an expression that
was not neutral at all.

Joaquin, sitting beside her, reached under the desk and took her hand.
She could not see his pulse quicken, could not see his adrenal
response, could not see any of the physiological markers that would
have been visible in a glass person. She could only feel his hand,
warm and solid and opaque, and trust that what it meant was what she
hoped it meant.

It was enough.

                              VII.

The trigger activated on a Tuesday.

It was not dramatic. There was no visible moment of change, no sudden
darkening, no curtain falling. It was slow and subtle, the way all
biological processes were slow and subtle: a gradual increase in
melanin production, a slow thickening of the skin's transparency, a
progressive softening of the internal details that had been visible
her entire life.

Over the first week, her skin took on a faint cloudiness, like glass
beginning to fog. Over the second week, the deeper structures — organs,
blood vessels, the skeletal lattice — receded from view, becoming
shadows rather than structures, suggestions rather than declarations.
Over the third week, the shadows faded further, and her skin began to
acquire color — the warm brown of her mother's complexion, emerging from
the transparency like a photograph developing in solution.

By the fourth week, she was opaque.

She stood in the bathroom mirror and looked at herself — at herself,
not through herself. For the first time in her life, she saw a surface.
A face that was a face, not a window. Eyes that were eyes, not lenses
through which you could see the orbital bones and the musculature
beneath. Skin that was skin — warm, brown, solid, concealing.

She raised her hand and looked at it. She could not see the bones. She
could not see the blood vessels. She could not see the tendons flex
when she moved her fingers. Her hand was simply a hand. Opaque.
Private. Hers.

She cried. She was not sure why. It was not grief and it was not joy.
It was something more complex — the emotion of arriving at a place you
had never been but had always been traveling toward. The emotion of
becoming, after a lifetime of transparency, someone with an inside.

Her mother held her. Through the hug, Mira could feel Adaeze's
heartbeat — through contact, through proximity, through the ordinary
opaque mechanisms of closeness. She could not see it. She could feel
it. And feeling, she understood now, was closer to knowing than seeing
had ever been.

Her father painted the final portrait. It showed Mira standing in the
bathroom, looking at herself in the mirror, her body solid and brown
and real. No light passing through. No internal structures visible.
Just a person, looking at herself, seeing — for the first time — a
surface that was her own, a wall that she had chosen not as a prison
but as a home.

He titled the painting "Opacity." It was the best work he had ever
done.

                              VIII.

Mira Okafor-Renn went to school. She was opaque. She was visible in
the ordinary way — a person among persons, a solid form in a world
of solid forms. When she stood in sunlight, she cast a shadow: sharp,
defined, her own. She did not glow. She did not refract. She did not
scatter rainbows on the floor.

Joaquin looked at her and saw her face — just her face, the outside
of it, the surface that she chose to present to the world.

"Different," he said.

"Same," she said. "Just — walls."

"Good walls?"

She considered this. She thought about the glass children who had
chosen suppression, who were living their adult lives in transparent
bodies, visible to everyone, legible to everyone, beautiful in
sunlight. She thought about Sola on the stage, luminous and fierce,
insisting that transparency was truth. She thought about the Privacy
Compact and their insistence that opacity was a right. She thought
about her mother, who had designed the modification to make children
visible, and her father, who had painted the visibility to make it
understood, and neither of them, for all their brilliance, had been
able to see the thing that was invisible in both conditions: the self.
The actual, irreducible, unseeable self that lived behind every surface,
transparent or opaque, and could only be shared by choice.

"Good walls," she said. "Not because they hide anything. Because
they're mine."

She walked into the school. The glass children glowed in the morning
light, casting their soft rainbows. The opaque children moved through
their solid shadows. And Mira, newly opaque, newly walled, newly in
possession of a body that was not a window — Mira walked among them
all, carrying her invisible self in her visible body, offering it to
no one and everyone, in the way that all selves were offered: carefully,
partially, by choice.

The sun rose higher. The light fell on everyone equally: the
transparent and the opaque, the visible and the hidden, the children
who were glass and the children who were not. It illuminated
everything. It revealed nothing. The important things — the things
that mattered, the things that made a person a person — remained where
they had always been: inside, in the dark, waiting to be offered.

Waiting to be chosen.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                      THE MERCENARY'S GARDEN

                         by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

                              I.

The garden covered three acres of bottomland along the Esharra River
on the agricultural world of Verdance, and it was the most beautiful
thing Jake Morrow had ever tended, which was saying something, because
before the garden Jake Morrow had tended nothing but weapons and
wounds and the thin hard line between living and dying.

He was on his knees in the tomato rows when the ship came down.

He heard it before he saw it — the deep, bone-shaking rumble of
atmospheric braking, the kind of sound that big military transports
made when they were in a hurry and didn't care who heard them. Morrow
raised his head and squinted into the pale green sky. The ship was a
Decker-class heavy lander, painted in the matte black of the Corvan
Security Corporation, and it was coming in fast and low over the river
valley, scattering a flock of dallbird from the treeline and leaving
a wake of disturbed air that shuddered through the tomato stakes like
a shiver.

Morrow watched it land in the fallow field north of the garden — the
field he'd been planning to plant with winter squash next month. The
lander's landing legs gouged three deep scars in the topsoil he'd
spent two years building up with compost and river silt. He felt each
gouge the way a man feels a scratch on his own skin.

He stood. He wiped his hands on his trousers. He was fifty-seven years
old, lean and weathered, with the kind of face that looked carved from
hardwood — all angles and planes and the permanent squint of a man who'd
spent too many years watching horizons for things that wanted to kill
him. His hands were scarred: the left one missing the tip of the ring
finger from a knife fight on Corsica Station, the right one scored
with the white lines of old cuts and burns that told the biography of
a thirty-year career in the private military trade.

Those hands were clean now. Dirt-clean. Garden-clean. The kind of clean
that came from working soil instead of working violence. Two years of
clean. Two years of growing things instead of destroying them. Two years
of waking up at dawn and walking out into the garden and feeling the
particular peace of a man who had put his weapons away and picked up
a hoe.

The lander's ramp dropped. Three figures emerged. Morrow recognized the
walk before he recognized the faces: the loose, balanced, ready-for-
anything stride of professional soldiers. The kind of walk he'd had
once. The kind of walk that said "I know exactly how to kill you" with
every step.

The lead figure was a woman. Tall, dark-haired, with the compact
musculature and flat gaze of a senior operator. She wore Corvan black
without insignia — which meant she was high enough in the organization
that her rank was understood rather than displayed.

Morrow knew her. He'd been hoping he wouldn't.

"Hello, Petra," he said.

Petra Kade stopped at the edge of the tomato rows. She looked at the
garden. She looked at Morrow — at his dirt-stained trousers, his
sun-faded shirt, his bare feet planted in the dark earth between the
rows. She looked at his hands, those legendary hands, caked with
garden soil.

"Jake," she said. "You look domestic."

"I am domestic. What do you want?"

"I want to talk."

"You brought a Decker-class lander and two operators to talk."

"I brought them because the last three people who came to talk to you
about coming back got thrown off the property. I figured a show of
seriousness was warranted."

"It's not. I'm retired."

"I know you're retired. I'm the one who processed your separation
papers, remember? I'm not here to un-retire you. I'm here to tell
you something, and then I'll leave."

Morrow looked at her. He'd served with Petra Kade for eleven years.
She'd been his second-in-command on the Tartarus operation, his
intelligence chief on the Bellerophon contract, his right hand and his
conscience — such as it was — through the worst years of his career.
She didn't waste trips. She didn't waste words. If she was here, it
mattered.

"Come inside," he said. "I'll make coffee."

                              II.

The house was small — three rooms, local timber, a kitchen that
doubled as everything else. Morrow had built it himself in the first
month after arriving on Verdance, using skills he'd picked up on
a dozen worlds where the infrastructure was rubble and you built
your shelter or you slept in the rain. It was simple and solid and
it smelled like the dried herbs he hung from the ceiling beams:
rosemary, thyme, sage. The herbs of a man who had learned to cook.

He made coffee. Kade sat at the kitchen table and studied the room
with the same quick, cataloging eye she'd used to assess hostile
terrain.

"You've got no weapons," she said.

"No."

"No sidearm. No rifle. No blade."

"I know what I don't have, Petra."

"Your perimeter security is a wooden fence designed to keep out
herbivores. Your door has no lock. You have no communications
equipment beyond a standard civilian node."

"I'm a farmer."

"You're Jake Morrow. You're the most dangerous man I've ever worked
with, and you're living like a monk in a vegetable garden with no
weapons and no security."

"That's the idea."

She drank her coffee. She was quiet for a moment, and Morrow recognized
the silence: Kade ordering her thoughts, the way she'd done before
every briefing, arranging the information into the sequence that would
have the most impact.

"Three months ago," she said, "Corvan took a contract with the
Hegemony. Logistics and security for a refugee resettlement operation
on the Outer Reach. The operation was supposed to be humanitarian —
moving displaced populations from the war zones to safe settlements
on neutral worlds."

"Supposed to be."

"Was, initially. The first phase went clean. Sixty thousand refugees
transported and settled. Food, shelter, medical care, the whole package.
Corvan's board was very pleased. Good optics. Good for the stock price."

"And then?"

Kade set down her coffee cup. "And then the Hegemony renegotiated the
contract. Phase two isn't resettlement. Phase two is pacification. The
refugees have organized. They've elected leaders. They're demanding
political representation, land rights, autonomy. The Hegemony wants
them controlled. Corvan's been tasked with, quote, 'maintaining order
in the settlement zones,' unquote."

"Maintaining order."

"They want us to put down the refugee leadership. Arrest the organizers.
Suppress the political movement. Turn the settlements into camps."

Morrow stared at his coffee. Through the kitchen window, he could see
the garden: the tomato rows, the bean trellises, the herb beds, the
compost pile steaming gently in the morning air. Beyond the garden,
the river. Beyond the river, the forest. Beyond the forest, the
mountains of Verdance, green and blue and indifferent.

"That's not my problem anymore," he said.

"No. It's not. Except for one thing." Kade reached into her jacket and
produced a data chip. She set it on the table between them. "The
refugee settlements that Corvan is tasked with pacifying. I pulled
the logistics data. Do you know where the food supply for those
settlements comes from?"

Morrow looked at the chip. He looked at Kade.

"Verdance," she said. "Your food. The crops from this valley — the
cooperative you organized, the agricultural network you've been
building for two years — feeds the Outer Reach settlements. You're
growing the food that keeps sixty thousand refugees alive. And Corvan
is about to turn those settlements into prisons."

Morrow closed his eyes.

"I didn't come here to un-retire you," Kade said. "I came here to tell
you that your garden is part of the war now. Whether you want it to be
or not."

She stood. She left the data chip on the table. She walked to the door.

"Petra."

She stopped.

"What's on the chip?"

"Corvan's operational plan for phase two. Timetable, force disposition,
command structure. And one more thing: the contract includes a clause
requiring all food suppliers to the settlement zones to submit to
Corvan oversight. Which means, in about six weeks, Corvan is going to
show up here and tell you that your garden belongs to them."

She left. The lander took off ten minutes later, gouging the fallow
field again on departure. Morrow sat at the kitchen table with the
data chip in his hand and the coffee going cold and the morning light
falling through the window onto his scarred, dirty, garden-clean hands.

                              III.

He didn't open the chip. Not right away.

He went back to the garden. He knelt in the tomato rows and worked.
He staked. He pruned. He pulled weeds from between the plants with the
careful, deliberate motions of a man who had learned that growing things
required patience and attention and a kind of gentleness that killing
things did not.

The garden had been his idea. When he'd arrived on Verdance two years
ago — broke, exhausted, carrying nothing but a duffel bag and thirty
years of things he wanted to forget — he'd found a world that grew
things the way other worlds built machines: prodigiously, effortlessly,
as if the soil itself were eager to produce. The bottomland along the
Esharra was the richest ground he'd ever seen: dark, deep, friable, a
living medium that turned whatever you planted into abundance.

He'd started with a quarter acre. Tomatoes, beans, greens. Enough to
feed himself. But the land wanted more, and Morrow — who had spent
his life taking orders and carrying them out — found that he could
take orders from the land just as easily. Plant this. Water this.
Harvest this. The instructions were clear. The results were immediate.
And the feeling — the feeling of pulling a ripe tomato from a vine he'd
planted, of holding in his hand something he'd grown from a seed,
something that would feed a person instead of killing one — that
feeling was unlike anything he'd experienced in thirty years of combat.

He'd expanded. He'd organized the other smallholders in the valley into
a cooperative. He'd negotiated distribution contracts with the refugee
resettlement agencies. He'd turned three acres of bottomland into a
productive farm that fed thousands of people, and he'd done it with
the same tactical precision and organizational skill that had once made
him the most effective mercenary commander in the private military
sector.

The irony was not lost on him. The skills were the same. The planning.
The logistics. The ability to assess terrain, allocate resources, manage
personnel, adapt to changing conditions. All the same skills. The only
difference was the product: food instead of death. Growth instead of
destruction. Something given instead of something taken.

He finished the tomatoes. He moved to the bean trellises. He worked
until the light shifted from morning to afternoon, and then he went
inside and opened the chip.

                              IV.

The operational plan was thorough. Corvan had always been thorough —
that was why clients paid their rates. Phase two called for the
deployment of three security battalions to the Outer Reach settlements,
approximately 1,800 operators. The mission was euphemistically described
as "stability operations" — a term that Morrow recognized from his own
career as covering everything from checkpoints and curfews to forced
relocations and targeted eliminations.

The timetable was aggressive: deployment in four weeks, full
operational capability in six. The food supply clause that Kade had
mentioned was in Appendix C, section 12, subsection (b), buried in
the logistics annex where no one would read it: "All agricultural
suppliers to designated settlement zones shall submit to Corvan
Security Corporation oversight, including production quotas,
distribution schedules, and compliance inspection."

Compliance inspection. Another euphemism. Morrow knew what compliance
inspection meant in practice: Corvan operators in his garden, telling
him what to grow and how much and for whom. Corvan controlling the food
supply to the settlements, which meant controlling the settlements
themselves, because whoever controlled the food controlled the people.

He closed the file. He sat in the kitchen and thought.

The old Jake Morrow — the mercenary, the operator, the man who had
spent thirty years solving problems with violence — would have known
exactly what to do. That Jake Morrow would have assessed the threat,
calculated the force ratios, identified the vulnerabilities in
Corvan's deployment, and devised a plan to exploit them. That Jake
Morrow had been very, very good at devising plans.

The new Jake Morrow — the farmer, the gardener, the man who had spent
two years learning to grow things and had sworn never to destroy again
— did not know what to do. The new Jake Morrow had no weapons. No
soldiers. No tactical infrastructure. The new Jake Morrow had a
garden, a cooperative of smallholders, and a commitment to nonviolence
that had been tested by nothing more threatening than a rabbit
infestation.

Morrow sat in the kitchen and felt the two versions of himself — the
destroyer and the grower, the soldier and the farmer — pulling in
opposite directions, like two hands gripping the same rope from
different ends.

He thought about the refugees. Sixty thousand people, already
displaced by war, already traumatized, already dependent on the food
that his garden helped provide. If Corvan took control of the food
supply, those people would become hostages. Fed or starved according
to their compliance. Growing food for them had been the most meaningful
thing Morrow had ever done; watching that food become a weapon would
be the most painful.

He thought about his oath. Not a formal oath — mercenaries didn't swear
oaths, they signed contracts — but the private, internal promise he'd
made to himself on the day he'd planted his first seed on Verdance:
never again. Never again would he pick up a weapon. Never again would
he use his skills for violence. Never again would he be the man he had
been.

He thought about what Kade had said: "Your garden is part of the war
now."

The garden had always been part of the war. That was the thing he
hadn't understood. You didn't escape war by growing vegetables. You
didn't transcend violence by refusing to practice it. The war came to
the garden the same way it came to everything — not because the
gardener invited it, but because war did not respect boundaries. War
did not respect the line between combatant and civilian, between the
battlefield and the farm, between the hand that held the weapon and
the hand that held the hoe.

Morrow went outside. He stood in the garden in the afternoon light and
looked at his tomatoes. They were heavy on the vine, red and ripe,
warm from the sun. He picked one and held it in his hand. It was
perfect. It was the product of soil and water and sunlight and two
years of careful, patient work.

He ate the tomato. The juice ran down his chin. He wiped it with the
back of his scarred hand.

Then he went inside and started planning.

                              V.

He did not pick up weapons. He wanted to be clear about that — clear
to himself, if no one else. What he picked up was something older
than weapons and, in its way, more powerful: knowledge of the ground.

The Esharra Valley was a hundred kilometers long and fifteen wide,
bounded by mountains on both sides, accessible by air from above and
by a single road from the south. Morrow had spent two years walking
this valley, learning its terrain with the same attention a general
gave to a battlefield — because he was a general, or had been, and
the habits of observation did not die just because the purpose changed.

He knew where the river ran shallow enough to ford and where it ran
deep and fast. He knew the trails through the mountain forests. He
knew the gullies, the ridges, the hidden valleys where the terrain
folded in on itself and visibility dropped to nothing. He knew the
soil: where it was deep and fertile, where it was thin and rocky,
where the water table sat close to the surface and where it dropped
to bedrock.

He knew the people. The Esharra Valley cooperative had forty-seven
member farms, ranging from small kitchen gardens to hundred-acre
spreads. The farmers were a mixed lot: some native to Verdance, some
settlers, some refugees themselves who'd been given land grants and
told to make something of it. They were not soldiers. They were
people who grew food. But they were also people who depended on their
land for survival, and people who depend on land for survival will
defend it with a ferocity that professional soldiers often
underestimate.

Morrow called a meeting. The cooperative met monthly in the community
hall at Esharra Crossing, a timber building that served as town hall,
market, and social center. Morrow stood at the front — an unfamiliar
position; he usually sat in the back — and told them what was coming.

He told them about Corvan. He told them about phase two. He told them
about the food supply clause and what compliance inspection meant in
practice. He did not sugarcoat it. He did not minimize the threat. He
spoke with the flat, clear precision of a man who had spent thirty
years assessing threats and who had never found that euphemism improved
the situation.

The room was quiet when he finished.

Anya Volkov, who ran the largest farm in the valley and who had the
broad shoulders and direct manner of a woman who had wrestled her
living from the ground for twenty years, spoke first.

"So what do we do? They'll have soldiers. We have pitchforks."

"We don't use pitchforks," Morrow said. "We don't use anything that
looks like a weapon. The moment we pick up weapons, we become
combatants, and Corvan is very good at dealing with combatants. We
don't fight them. We outgrow them."

"Outgrow them?"

"Corvan needs our food to control the settlements. Without the food
supply, the settlements collapse, Corvan fails to deliver on the
contract, and the Hegemony terminates the operation. The food is the
leverage. And the food is ours."

He laid out the plan. It was, in its essentials, a military plan — a
campaign, with objectives, phases, logistics, and contingencies — but
it involved no weapons, no violence, and no direct confrontation with
Corvan's forces. It was, Morrow thought, the most difficult plan he
had ever devised, because it required him to use everything he knew
about war without actually waging one.

Phase one: diversify the distribution network. Currently, all food from
the valley passed through a single distribution hub controlled by the
resettlement agency. Corvan's takeover would capture that hub. Morrow
proposed establishing alternative distribution channels — direct
shipments to the settlements, bypassing the hub, using the river and
the mountain trails that he'd mapped over two years of walking the
valley. Routes that a Decker-class lander couldn't follow and that
ground patrols would take weeks to find.

Phase two: cache. Morrow proposed pre-positioning food stores at hidden
locations throughout the valley and along the distribution routes.
Enough to feed the settlements for three months without the hub. If
Corvan seized the farms, the food would already be dispersed.

Phase three: refuse. When Corvan arrived with compliance inspections
and production quotas, the cooperative would simply refuse. Not with
violence. With the oldest weapon in the farmer's arsenal:
noncompliance. You could force a man to fight. You could not force a
man to farm. Agriculture required care, knowledge, timing, a thousand
small decisions made by a person who understood the soil and the
seasons. A farm run by soldiers would produce nothing. Corvan could
take the land, but they could not take the knowledge.

"And if they arrest us?" Anya asked.

"Then the farms go untended. The crops fail. The food supply collapses.
Corvan still fails."

"And the refugees starve."

"No. Because by then, the caches will be in place and the alternative
distribution routes will be operational. The refugees get fed. Corvan
gets nothing."

The room was quiet. Morrow looked at their faces — farmers' faces,
weather-worn and skeptical, the faces of people who judged plans not
by their elegance but by their practicality.

"I was a mercenary for thirty years," Morrow said. "I know how Corvan
thinks. I know how they plan. I know how they operate. And I know their
weakness: they understand force. They do not understand land. They do
not understand soil. They do not understand the thousand things that
have to go right for a seed to become food. We know those things.
That's our advantage."

Anya Volkov looked at him for a long time. Then she nodded.

"All right," she said. "Tell us what to plant."

                              VI.

They had five weeks. Morrow used them the way he'd used pre-deployment
preparation periods in his military career: every hour scheduled, every
task assigned, every contingency planned. But instead of weapons drills
and tactical rehearsals, the preparation involved harvesting, caching,
and mapping.

The cooperative harvested everything that was ripe. They dried, canned,
and sealed food stores and dispersed them to seventeen cache sites that
Morrow selected along the river and in the mountain valleys — sites
chosen for concealment, accessibility, and distance from the main roads
and landing fields that Corvan would use. Each cache held enough food
for two hundred people for one month. Together, they could sustain the
settlements for the critical period.

Morrow walked the distribution routes himself, marking trails, noting
water sources, identifying rally points and rest stations. He taught
the younger members of the cooperative the basics of overland
navigation: how to read terrain, how to move without being observed,
how to carry loads efficiently over long distances. He taught them
without calling it what it was — tactical training — because the skills
were the same whether you were moving ammunition or turnips.

He worked in the garden every evening. He would not surrender the
garden to preparation. The garden was the point. The garden was why
any of this mattered. If he let the garden go untended in order to
prepare for its defense, he had already lost.

He weeded. He watered. He staked the tomatoes and trained the beans
up their trellises and harvested the first zucchini of the season,
enormous and slightly ridiculous, the vegetable equivalent of a
parade float.

He thought about the men he had killed. There had been many. He did
not know the exact number — that was a fiction of war movies, the
notion that soldiers kept count. In reality, the violence blurred,
individual acts merging into a continuum of force applied and received,
until the specific faces and specific moments were lost in the general
noise. He remembered some. The first, on a space station corridor in
the Trojans, a young man with a rifle who had hesitated and died for
it. The last, on a burning deck on Tartarus, a woman who had not
hesitated and had died anyway.

He did not want to add to the count. He wanted the count to be
finished. He wanted the rest of his life to be measured not in people
destroyed but in food grown, not in ground taken but in ground
cultivated, not in victories but in harvests.

The tomatoes ripened. The zucchini grew. The caches filled. The trails
were marked. And on the morning of the sixth week, right on schedule,
Corvan arrived.

                              VII.

They came in three landers — not the single Decker-class that Kade had
brought, but three, carrying a full security platoon: thirty-six
operators in Corvan black, armed and armored, deploying into the
valley with the practiced efficiency of professionals on a routine
operation.

Morrow met them in the garden.

He was on his knees in the tomato rows, exactly where he'd been when
Kade came. He did not stand. He did not stop working. He continued
staking a tomato plant that had grown heavy with fruit and was listing
to the side, tying it to its support with the careful knots he'd
learned from a farming manual two years ago.

The platoon commander approached. He was a young man — thirty, maybe —
with the close-cropped hair and smooth, unlined face of someone who
had risen through the ranks on competence and had not yet been marked
by the work. His name tag read "HALLORAN."

"Mr. Morrow. I'm Lieutenant Halloran, Corvan Security Corporation.
I have a compliance order for the Esharra Valley Agricultural
Cooperative."

"I'm tying up a tomato," Morrow said.

"Sir—"

"Give me a minute." He finished the knot. He tested it. He moved to
the next plant. "All right. What's a compliance order?"

"Under the terms of the Hegemony Resettlement Support Contract,
section twelve, subsection—"

"I've read it. You're here to take over the food supply."

Halloran paused. He had not expected Morrow to have read the contract.

"We're here to implement oversight of agricultural production in
support of—"

"You're here to take over the food supply," Morrow repeated. "You
can use whatever words you like. The answer is no."

Halloran looked at the garden. He looked at Morrow. He looked at the
scarred hands working in the soil. Morrow knew that Halloran had been
briefed on who he was — Corvan's intelligence files on Jake Morrow
would be extensive — and he could see the calculation happening behind
the young officer's eyes: this was not a farmer. This was a former
operator with thirty years of combat experience who was refusing an
order while kneeling in a tomato row.

"Mr. Morrow. The compliance order is not optional. Refusal will be
treated as a breach of contract, which authorizes Corvan to assume
direct operational control of—"

"Of what? The dirt?" Morrow gestured at the garden. "Take the dirt.
It's right here. All three acres of it. You're welcome to it." He
picked up a handful of soil and held it out. "Here. This handful will
grow about four tomato plants, if you plant them at the right depth,
in the right soil temperature, with the right spacing, at the right
time of year, and water them correctly, and stake them correctly, and
watch for blight, and prune them correctly, and harvest them at the
right moment. Or you can just hold the dirt. Your choice."

Halloran stared at the handful of soil.

"Farming isn't a resource you can seize," Morrow said. "It's a skill.
It's a relationship with the ground. You can take the ground. You
cannot take the relationship. And without the relationship, the ground
produces nothing."

"We can compel—"

"You can compel a man to dig a ditch. You can compel a man to carry a
load. You cannot compel a man to grow food. Growing food requires
knowledge, attention, judgment, and care. Those things cannot be
compelled. They can only be given."

He let the soil fall from his hand. He went back to staking tomatoes.

Halloran stood in the garden for a long time. Then he returned to his
platoon and called headquarters.

                              VIII.

The occupation, such as it was, lasted three months.

Corvan established a base on the fallow field — the one their lander
had already scarred — and began conducting compliance inspections.
They inspected the farms. They inspected the distribution hub. They
inspected the cooperative's records, which Morrow had helpfully made
available in their entirety, because the records contained nothing
damaging. The caches were not in the records. The alternative
distribution routes were not in the records. The records showed exactly
what Corvan expected to see: a cooperative of small farms growing food
for refugee settlements, operating within the terms of the original
resettlement contract.

The farmers refused to comply with the new production quotas. They
refused politely, firmly, and unanimously. Morrow had prepared them
for this: refusal was a skill, like any other, and it required practice.
They practiced by role-playing the confrontations in advance, by
rehearsing the specific phrases that communicated noncompliance without
provocation, by learning the particular body language of passive
resistance that made it impossible for the occupiers to escalate
without looking like bullies.

Corvan could not farm. Morrow had been right about this: the operators
were soldiers, trained for security work, and they did not know how to
grow food. They tried. Halloran, to his credit, assigned a squad to
work the fields under the guidance of an agricultural manual. The
results were predictable: the crops failed. Seeds were planted too deep
or too shallow. Watering schedules were wrong. Pest management was
nonexistent. Within a month, the fields under Corvan management were
producing nothing.

Meanwhile, the caches sustained the settlements. The alternative
distribution routes — the river trails and mountain paths that Morrow
had mapped — carried food to the refugees without passing through
Corvan's checkpoint. The refugees were fed. Corvan's operation was
failing.

Halloran came to see Morrow again, on the sixty-third day. He found
him in the garden. Morrow was always in the garden.

"This isn't working," Halloran said.

"No," Morrow agreed. He was harvesting beans. "It's not."

"We can't grow anything. Your cooperative won't cooperate. The refugees
are getting food from somewhere we can't locate. And headquarters is
asking why the pacification contract is producing no results."

"Farming isn't pacification, Lieutenant. That's the problem. You came
here with a military solution to an agricultural problem. Doesn't
work. Never has. The ground doesn't respond to force."

Halloran sat down on the edge of a raised bed. He looked tired. He
looked, Morrow thought, like a young officer at the end of a deployment
that had gone wrong — not catastrophically, not violently, but slowly,
attrionally, in the demoralizing way that happens when the mission is
impossible and everyone knows it but no one has the authority to say so.

"What would work?" Halloran asked.

Morrow looked at him. He saw, behind the Corvan black and the
close-cropped hair and the smooth young face, a person. A person who
had signed on for security work and found himself trying to farm at
gunpoint on a planet where the soil was better than the mission.

"What would work," Morrow said, "is leaving us alone. Letting the
cooperative operate. Letting the food flow to the settlements without
oversight. Letting the refugees organize and govern themselves."

"That's not the contract."

"Then the contract is wrong. And you know it's wrong, or you wouldn't
be sitting on my bean bed asking me what would work."

Halloran was quiet. The afternoon light slanted across the garden,
warm and gold, and the plants stood in it the way plants always stand
in afternoon light: patiently, silently, doing the work of converting
sunlight into food without any concern for the political arrangements
of the beings who would eat them.

"I can't just leave," Halloran said. "I have orders."

"I know about orders. I followed them for thirty years. And then I
came here and I planted a garden, and the garden gave me different
orders: grow things. Feed people. Take care of the ground. Those are
better orders, Lieutenant. They're the only orders worth following."

Halloran stood. He looked at the garden. He looked at Morrow. He
walked back to his base without saying another word.

                              IX.

On the eighty-ninth day, Corvan withdrew.

The official reason, transmitted to Halloran from headquarters, was
"contract restructuring" — a corporate euphemism for failure. The
pacification operation had produced no results. The food supply could
not be controlled. The refugees could not be starved into compliance.
The Hegemony, facing political pressure and the logistical reality that
Corvan could not deliver, agreed to renegotiate the resettlement
contract under terms that did not include the food supply clause.

Halloran came to the garden one last time. Morrow was kneeling in the
tomato rows. Halloran stood at the edge and watched him work.

"We're leaving," Halloran said.

"I know."

"Your fallow field is torn up. Landing damage. I'm sorry about that."

"Soil recovers," Morrow said. "Give it a season and some compost.
It'll come back."

Halloran nodded. He stood there. He seemed to want to say something
else.

"Lieutenant."

"Yes?"

"When you get out — whenever that is — come back here. I could use
help with the winter squash."

Halloran looked at him. For a moment, something moved behind the young
officer's professional composure — something that might have been
surprise, or gratitude, or the first faint stirring of a thought that
there were other ways to live.

"I'll think about it," he said.

He left. The landers took off, scarring the fallow field one last
time. Morrow watched them rise into the pale green sky and dwindle to
points and disappear.

He went back to the garden.

The tomatoes were at their peak: heavy, red, bursting with the juice
of the valley's rich soil and long growing season. He picked one and
held it in his hand. It was warm from the sun. It was perfect. It
was the product of care and patience and skill, and it would feed
someone — a refugee, a child, a stranger — who would never know the
name of the man who grew it.

Morrow ate the tomato. He wiped the juice from his chin. He knelt in
the dirt and continued working.

The garden grew. The river ran. The mountains stood against the sky.
And Jake Morrow — mercenary, soldier, killer, farmer — tended his
tomatoes in the afternoon light, and the food grew, and the world
turned, and the violence he had spent his life practicing receded
behind him like a shore seen from a departing ship: still visible,
still real, but no longer the ground beneath his feet.

The ground beneath his feet was dark and rich and alive, and it asked
nothing of him but care.

He gave it.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

COL. JAMES "BUCK" STANTON (RET.) flew P-51 Mustangs over Europe and
commanded a fighter wing in Korea before retiring to a ranch outside
Fredericksburg, Texas, and turning his combat experience into some of
the most authentic military science fiction ever published. His stories
for this magazine, beginning with "Sortie" in our sixth issue, have
set the standard for honest depictions of the human cost of war.
"The Pacifist's Arsenal" is, by his own admission, "the strangest
thing I've ever written and the one I'm most afraid of." He describes
it as "a story about a man who tries to stop being a weapon designer
and discovers that the last weapon is always the one you design for
yourself." Stanton lives on his ranch with his wife Martha and reports
that the cattle are unimpressed by his literary career.

SANJAY MUKHERJEE is an associate professor of cultural anthropology at
UC Berkeley whose first story for this magazine, "The Wedding on
Centauri" (Issue #56), announced a distinctive new voice in
anthropological science fiction. Born in Calcutta and educated at
Presidency College and Berkeley, Mukherjee brings the methods and
insights of professional fieldwork to his fiction, producing stories of
unusual cultural depth and complexity. "Borders" draws on the legacy of
the Partition of India and on Mukherjee's conviction that "the most
dangerous borders are not geographical but philosophical." He lives in
Berkeley with his wife, psychologist Mika Hayashi, and their two
children.

FRANKLIN HOYT has been writing political science fiction for this
magazine since Issue #14, when his McCarthyism allegory "The Committee"
prompted threatening letters that our editor framed and displayed in
his office. A Howard University graduate, former journalist, and
Army veteran who served in a segregated unit during the war, Hoyt
brings a journalist's clarity and a moralist's fire to every story he
writes. "Dispatches from a Fabricated Front" is his most sustained
examination of the relationship between truth and power, a subject he
considers "the only one worth writing about." He lives in Washington,
D.C., with his wife Barbara, a civil rights attorney.

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a professor of astrophysics at Caltech whose
stories have appeared in every era of this magazine, beginning with
"Perihelion" in Issue #3. A physicist of international reputation and
a writer of exacting scientific rigor, Koslov brings to his fiction a
rare combination of precision and poetry. "Lullaby for a Dying Star"
represents a departure for Koslov — less interested in the physics of
stellar collapse (though the physics, as always, are impeccable) than
in the emotional response of a human being confronted with cosmic
indifference. He describes the story as "the first time I have written
about something I cannot prove: that compassion matters even when it
changes nothing." He lives in Pasadena with his wife, sculptor Anne
Lindqvist.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, with stories in nearly every issue since 1953. A former
autoworker, Battle of the Bulge veteran, and technical writer for
General Motors, Cain brings a working man's sensibility and a
craftsman's reliability to everything he writes. "Glass Children" is
among his most ambitious and personal stories — a meditation on
visibility and privacy that he describes as "the story I've been
circling for twenty years." He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his
wife Jean and writes every evening from eight to midnight, seven days
a week.

REX DRUMMOND needs no introduction to readers of this magazine. The
Texan swashbuckler who gave us "Blaze of the Outer Dark," "The Sword
of Sirius," and a dozen other tales of interstellar adventure here
delivers something altogether different: a quiet, character-driven
story about a man who stops fighting and starts growing things. "The
Mercenary's Garden" may surprise readers who know Drummond only for his
action-packed space opera, but those who have followed his more recent
work — particularly "Last Stand at Cygnus Gate" (Issue #52) — will
recognize a writer whose range is deeper than his reputation suggests.
"I got tired of writing about men who blow things up," Drummond says.
"I wanted to write about a man who grows things. Turns out it's
harder." He lives in San Diego and is at work on a novel.

================================================================================

Dear Editors,

Dr. Koslov's "The Quiet After Cascade" in the January issue was the
most affecting piece of hard science fiction I have read in years.
The scene in which the station commander decides to delay transmission
of the data — knowing that every hour of delay means another hour of
peace on Earth, and another hour of scientific dishonesty — is moral
fiction at its finest. Please tell Dr. Koslov that I have checked his
radiation calculations and they are, as usual, impeccable.

Dear Mr. Sterling and Ms. Foxworth,

I write to express my appreciation for the increased diversity of
voices in the magazine since Ms. Foxworth joined the editorial desk.
The addition of writers like Mukherjee, Prescott, and Voss has
transformed "Tales" from a very good science fiction magazine into an
essential one. I particularly admire the anthropological sophistication
of Mukherjee's "The Wedding on Centauri" and look forward to more of
his work.

Dear Editors,

Rex Drummond's "Last Stand at Cygnus Gate" was a shock. When Drummond
kills a hero, you know the world is changing. I've been reading Drummond
since "Blaze of the Outer Dark" and I never expected him to write a
story with that kind of moral weight. More like this, please. And tell
him I forgive him for killing Captain Voss. Almost.

Dear Sterling,

I have subscribed to your magazine since its first issue and have
watched its evolution with admiration and occasional bewilderment. The
"New Renaissance" — as you insist on calling it — has produced some
extraordinary work, but I confess that I miss the days when a science
fiction magazine was permitted to be fun. Not every story needs to be a
meditation on the human condition. Some of us read science fiction to
escape the human condition, at least for an hour.

That said, Hoyt's "The Profit Motive" in the March issue scared the
living hell out of me, which I suppose is a form of entertainment.
Carry on.

DUNE by Frank Herbert
(Chilton Books, 1965, $5.95)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Herbert's monumental novel has been serialized in "Analog" over the
past two years, but its arrival in book form reveals it as something
that the serial format could not fully convey: one of the most
ambitious works of science fiction ever attempted. Set on the desert
planet Arrakis, "Dune" weaves together ecology, politics, religion,
and the dynamics of empire into a narrative of extraordinary density
and power. Paul Atreides is a hero of mythic proportions — part messiah,
part strategist, part ecological thinker — and the world Herbert has
built around him is one of the most fully realized in the genre's
history. The prose is dense and occasionally overwrought, the
philosophical digressions sometimes test the reader's patience, and
the final third moves at a pace that some will find rushed. None of
this matters. "Dune" is a landmark, and anyone who reads science fiction
must read it. Our highest recommendation.

THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH by Philip K. Dick
(Doubleday, 1965, $4.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Dick continues his investigation of the blurred boundary between
reality and illusion with this deeply unsettling novel about a drug
that offers an escape from a miserable future — and a competing drug
that offers something far worse. As always with Dick, the plot is
less important than the metaphysical vertigo he induces: by the end
of the novel, neither the characters nor the reader can be entirely
certain what is real, and the uncertainty is the point. Dick is our
most important paranoid, and this is among his most sustained
achievements. For readers who enjoy firm ground beneath their feet, a
warning: there is none here. Recommended with reservations about the
reader's sanity afterward.

A second Dick novel in the same year, and one that deserves attention
alongside its more celebrated sibling. Set in the aftermath of nuclear
war in the San Francisco Bay Area, "Dr. Bloodmoney" is a picaresque
novel of survival, community, and the stubborn persistence of ordinary
life in extraordinary circumstances. It is warmer and more human than
much of Dick's work, and its portrait of a post-apocalyptic community
rebuilding itself from the fragments of the old world is surprisingly
hopeful. A different Dick — less paranoid, more compassionate — and
well worth your time.

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue:

"THE GHOST FREQUENCY" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A radio astronomer

What was it saying? And who is still pressing play?

"THE CONSUL'S DAUGHTER" by Cassandra Voss — When a diplomatic crisis
erupts between Earth and the Centauri Alliance, a career diplomat must

discover that the machines have begun manufacturing something not in
the production schedule. A classic Cain problem story with an ending
that will keep you up at night.

trading culture discovers that the pidgin has begun to say things
that neither parent language can express.

reviews, and more.
