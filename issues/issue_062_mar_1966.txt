TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

We begin with a confession: we are proud. This is not, in general, an
editorial posture we adopt. Editors are custodians, not stars, and the proper
editorial affect is a kind of dignified self-effacement — the discreet hand
that arranges flowers without calling attention to itself. But this month we
will permit ourselves a moment of honest pride, because something remarkable
has happened.

Tales from the Future and Beyond has been nominated for the Hugo Award.

To those readers who may not follow the machinations of our field's peculiar
honor system, the Hugo is awarded annually by the members of the World Science
Fiction Convention, and it represents the closest thing science fiction
possesses to a consensus of its readership. It is a reader's award, which
means that it is you — not a panel of critics, not a committee of our peers,
but you, the people who put down seventy-five cents at the newsstand and trust
us to fill your evening with wonder — who have placed us among the best
magazines in the field.

We are humbled. We are gratified. We are determined to prove that the
nomination was not a fluke.

To that end, we have assembled an issue that we believe represents the full
range of what this magazine can be. Dr. Vincent Koslov opens with "The
Heretic's Frequency," a story that begins as hard science fiction of the most
rigorous kind and becomes something else entirely — a meditation on what
happens to human beings when they receive an answer they cannot refuse and
cannot bear. Julian St. Croix offers "The Flaying of Marsyas," a story drawn
from Greek myth and set among the stars, in which the meaning of art and the
price of aesthetic failure are explored with a beauty that is itself a kind of
argument. Gunnar Eriksson contributes "The Last Signal," which at approximately
eighteen hundred words is the shortest story we have ever published in these
pages — and which may also be, word for word, the most powerful. We do not say
this lightly. Theodore Cain brings his characteristic clarity and moral
seriousness to "Sanctuary," a story about the architecture of peace that draws
quiet but unmistakable strength from the struggles of our own time. Agnes
Whitfield returns with "The Greenhouse Directive," a story of ecological
catastrophe and unintended consequence that speaks to anxieties we suspect will
only grow more urgent in the decades to come. And Sanjay Mukherjee closes the
issue with "The Translator's Paradox," a story about the nature of sacred
texts that is itself something close to sacred.

Six stories. One Hugo nomination. A magazine that intends to earn it.

A note on Eriksson's "The Last Signal." We debated, as editors, whether a
story of such brevity belonged in a magazine that has always favored the long
form. Diana argued that length is a convention, not a virtue. Maxwell argued
that the story's compression is itself its subject — that its brevity enacts
the very economy of meaning it describes. We agreed on this: it is a
masterpiece, and masterpieces earn their place regardless of word count. We
believe you will agree.

Write to us. Tell us what moved you. Tell us what provoked you. A Hugo
nomination is a conversation between a magazine and its readers, and we want
to hear your voice in that conversation.

Yours among the stars,

                         THE HERETIC'S FREQUENCY

                        by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                               I.

The signal arrived at 03:47 UTC on a Tuesday in November, which was
inconvenient because Dr. Nadia Orlov had just made coffee and was hoping for
a quiet shift.

She was seated at the primary monitoring station of the Atacama Deep Array, a
linked network of forty-two radio dishes spread across eighteen kilometers of
Chilean desert, their parabolic surfaces aimed at a patch of sky in the
constellation Bootes that had shown a marginal anomaly in last month's
spectral survey. The anomaly was almost certainly instrumental — a ghost in
the correlator, a calibration drift, the kind of phantom that radio astronomy
produced with the regularity of a factory manufacturing defective goods. She
had been assigned the follow-up observation as a courtesy, which in the
hierarchy of the Array meant that no one senior enough to refuse it was
willing to sit through eight hours of noise for a probable null result.

Nadia did not mind. She was forty-three years old, the holder of a doctorate
in astrophysics from Moscow State University and a postdoctoral appointment
at the European Southern Observatory that had outlasted its original term by
six years, which in the economics of academic employment meant she was
essential enough to keep and not important enough to promote. She had
published nineteen papers on the hydrogen emission spectra of high-redshift
galaxies, three of which had been cited more than a hundred times, and she
had long since made peace with the probability that her career would be
defined by competence rather than brilliance. She was a good radio astronomer.
She had been a good radio astronomer for twenty years. The universe had not
yet seen fit to reveal to her anything that a good radio astronomer would not
have found eventually.

She sipped her coffee — black, no sugar, in a ceramic mug bearing the faded
logo of a conference she had attended in Bonn — and watched the waterfall
display cascade down her monitor in the standard false-color palette. Blue
meant background. Green meant noise. Yellow meant attention. Red meant
impossible.

At 03:47, the display went red.

Not partially red. Not a flicker of red at the margin. The entire bandwidth,
from 1.42 to 1.72 gigahertz, saturated simultaneously, and the signal
strength indicator climbed past any value Nadia had seen in two decades of
observation. She put down her coffee with the careful deliberation of someone
who recognizes that the next few seconds will determine whether she is
experiencing a malfunction or a discovery.

She ran the diagnostics. Antenna pointing: confirmed. Correlator status:
nominal. Local interference scan: clean. She switched to the backup receiver.
The signal was there. She pointed a single dish thirty degrees off-axis. The
signal vanished. She returned it to the original coordinates. The signal
returned.

It was real. It was coming from the target coordinates in Bootes. And it was
structured.

She picked up the telephone that connected to the Array director's residence,
four kilometers away, and dialed the number she had never expected to use.

"Dr. Ferrara," she said, when the voice on the other end resolved from sleep
into irritation. "I need you to come in. I am receiving a structured signal
from the Bootes field."

A pause. "What kind of structure?"

"Mathematical."

Ferrara was there in eleven minutes, which meant he had driven the desert road
at twice the posted speed. He arrived with his shirt untucked and his hair
uncombed, but his eyes were fully awake. He sat down beside Nadia and looked
at the display.

"Show me," he said.

She showed him.

                               II.

The structure of the signal was unlike anything in the SETI detection
protocols.

The protocols anticipated several possibilities: prime number sequences, which
would demonstrate mathematical awareness; physical constants encoded in
binary, which would demonstrate knowledge of the universe; pictographic grids,
which would demonstrate spatial reasoning; or simple repetitive pulses, which
would demonstrate intentionality if nothing else. The signal from Bootes
matched none of these templates.

What it contained was a proof.

This became apparent over the first seventy-two hours, as the Array's full
computational resources were brought to bear on the signal's content. The
transmission repeated on a cycle of 4.7 hours — long enough to encode a
substantial body of information, short enough to ensure redundancy. The
encoding scheme was elegant: a base-twelve numerical system defined by the
signal's own internal structure, with mathematical operations introduced
through a sequence of examples that progressed from elementary arithmetic
to abstract algebra to topology with the pedagogical patience of a teacher
who has unlimited time and a student of unknown capability.

The early portions — the arithmetic, the algebra — were familiar. They
recapitulated known mathematics with a formalism that was different from
any human notation but translatable without ambiguity. The Atacama team
decoded these sections within the first day, working in shifts, filling
whiteboards with equivalences and drinking coffee that grew progressively
worse as the administrative staff realized no one was going home.

Nadia worked through those first hours with the focused intensity that had
characterized her entire career — the ability to concentrate on a task to
the exclusion of everything else, including her own reactions. She was
aware, in the way that a swimmer is aware of the depth of the water beneath
her, that what they were decoding might be the most significant artifact in
human history. She did not allow this awareness to interfere with her work.
The signal required attention. The signal would receive attention. Her
feelings about the signal were, for the moment, irrelevant.

This compartmentalization — this ability to postpone emotional response in
favor of methodical observation — was, she would later reflect, both her
greatest professional asset and the thing that separated her from the rest
of humanity when the implications became clear. She had been trained to
observe. She had not been trained to be transformed by what she observed.

It was the later sections that caused the trouble.

On the third day, Dr. Yusuf al-Rashid, a mathematician on loan from the
University of Santiago, looked up from his workstation with an expression
Nadia had seen only once before — on the face of a pilot who had been told
that his engine was on fire. It was the expression of a man who understood
something he wished he did not.

"It's a proof," al-Rashid said. "A complete, formal proof."

"Of what?" Ferrara asked.

Al-Rashid removed his glasses and polished them on his shirt, which Nadia
recognized as a stalling technique. He was organizing his thoughts. Or,
possibly, his courage.

"It proves that the universe is a constructed system," he said. "A
computation. A simulation, if you prefer the colloquial term. And the proof
is rigorous. I have checked the logic three times. There are no errors."

The room went silent. Not the productive silence of people thinking, but the
airless silence of a space from which all the oxygen has been suddenly removed.

"Explain," Ferrara said.

Al-Rashid put his glasses back on. "The proof begins with a set of axioms
drawn from quantum field theory — our quantum field theory, expressed in their
notation. It then demonstrates, through a chain of theorems that I can follow
but could not have constructed, that the fundamental constants of the universe
are not arbitrary. They are the output of a computational process. The
relationship between the gravitational constant, the fine-structure constant,
Planck's constant, and the speed of light is not merely consistent with a
computational substrate — it requires one. The proof shows that no
non-computational physics can produce these specific values in combination."

"That's the fine-tuning argument," said Dr. Lena Park, the Array's youngest
staff astronomer, who was standing by the door. "That's not new."

"The fine-tuning argument is an observation," al-Rashid said. "This is a
derivation. The difference is the difference between noticing that a bridge
stands and proving from the engineering specifications that it must. The proof
does not argue from the improbability of the constants. It derives their
necessity from the structure of computation itself. It shows that the
constants are what they are because they are being computed, and it identifies
the computational signatures — specific patterns in the distribution of prime
numbers, in the behavior of quantum decoherence, in the topology of spacetime
at the Planck scale — that constitute evidence of the underlying process."

"Evidence," Ferrara repeated.

"Proof," al-Rashid said. "Not evidence. Proof. I do not use the word lightly."

                               III.

The news contained itself for nine days, which was seven days longer than
anyone had predicted.

The Array operated under a protocol that required independent verification
before any announcement of a detected signal. Ferrara invoked the protocol
and simultaneously contacted four institutions: the National Radio Astronomy
Observatory in Green Bank, the Parkes Observatory in Australia, the Jodrell
Bank Observatory in England, and the Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn.
Within forty-eight hours, all four had confirmed the signal's existence and
basic structure. Within five days, three independent mathematical teams had
verified al-Rashid's assessment of the proof.

On the ninth day, someone at Jodrell Bank told a journalist, and by the
morning of the tenth day, every major newspaper on the planet carried the
story.

Nadia followed the coverage from the monitoring station, where she had
essentially taken up residence. She slept on a camp cot in the equipment room
and showered in the facility's single bathroom and ate from the vending
machine in the corridor. She did this not because anyone required it of her
but because she had realized, sometime around day four, that she could not
stop listening to the signal. It was not a compulsion. It was something closer
to a sense of duty — the awareness that someone should be listening, that the
signal deserved the attention of at least one human being at all times, and
that she had been the one to find it.

The world's reaction organized itself, as human reactions do, into categories.

The first category was joy. A non-trivial number of people, upon learning that
the universe was a simulation, experienced something indistinguishable from
religious ecstasy. If the universe was computed, then it had been computed by
something — a designer, a creator, an intelligence of such scope that it
could construct physical law from mathematical first principles. The
simulation hypothesis, for these people, was proof of God, and they celebrated
it with the fervor of believers who have been vindicated beyond their most
audacious hopes.

Nadia watched a broadcast from St. Peter's Square in which a crowd of fifty
thousand people wept and embraced and held up signs reading DEUS COMPUTAT.
She watched a tent revival in Alabama where a preacher declared that the
signal was the voice of the Lord confirming His creation, and the
congregation fell to their knees. She watched a Hindu commentator explain,
calmly and eruditely, that the concept of maya — the universe as illusion,
as divine play — had been a cornerstone of Vedantic philosophy for three
thousand years, and that the signal merely confirmed what the Upanishads
had always taught.

The second category was despair.

For an equally non-trivial number of people, the proof that the universe was
a simulation meant that nothing was real. If physical reality was the output
of a computation, then physical experience — love, pain, the weight of a
child in your arms, the taste of bread, the terror of death — was not
authentic. It was generated. It was, in the language that spread through the
news coverage with the speed of contagion, "just data." The existential
implications were devastating, and they struck hardest at those who had
built their understanding of meaning on the foundation of material reality.

There were suicides. Not many, but enough. A physics professor in Berlin left
a note that read: "If the constants are computed, then the equations are a
lie, and I have spent my life worshipping a lie." A seventeen-year-old girl
in Osaka posted a video in which she said, calmly and in excellent English,
"If nothing is real, then nothing matters, and I am tired of pretending
otherwise." She did not survive the night. Nadia read about both cases on the
wire service and sat very still for a long time, staring at the signal's
waterfall display cascading down her monitor in its endless red.

The third category was denial.

A significant number of people simply refused to accept the proof. Not because
they could identify an error in the mathematics — they could not, and neither
could the world's most accomplished mathematicians, several of whom had been
trying for days — but because the conclusion was intolerable, and human beings
have always been willing to reject intolerable conclusions regardless of the
evidence. The denial took various forms: the signal was a hoax, the
translation was wrong, the mathematics was meaningless, the aliens were
deceiving humanity for unknown purposes, the proof was technically valid but
physically irrelevant. Religious leaders who had initially celebrated the
signal as proof of God began to reconsider when they recognized that the proof
did not specify a God — it specified a computation, which was not the same
thing at all. Some retreated to the position that God operated through
computation, which preserved theological coherence at the cost of specificity.
Others denounced the signal as a Satanic deception, which preserved theological
specificity at the cost of coherence.

The fourth category was indifference.

This surprised Nadia more than any of the others. A substantial portion of
the global population received the news that the universe was a simulation,
considered it for a moment, and returned to the business of living. They fed
their children. They went to work. They argued with their spouses and paid
their bills and watched television and made love and slept. The universe was
a simulation. So what? The rent was still due on the first of the month.

Nadia found this response the most rational and the most mysterious.

                               IV.

The mathematicians arrived in waves.

The first wave came from the universities — tenured professors and postdoctoral
researchers who cleared their schedules and booked flights to Chile with the
desperate urgency of people who understood that they were living through the
most significant mathematical event in human history. They came with laptops
and legal pads and the particular intensity of the theoretically gifted, and
they set up in the Array's conference room and worked through the proof line
by line, symbol by symbol, searching for the flaw that would restore the
universe to its former status as an unmediated reality.

They did not find it.

The proof was, by universal consensus, correct. Not probably correct.
Not correct-pending-further-review. Correct in the absolute sense that a
mathematical proof can be correct: every step followed from the preceding
step by the inviolable logic of the formal system, and the conclusion was
entailed by the premises with the same necessity that the Pythagorean theorem
was entailed by the axioms of Euclidean geometry. You could reject the
axioms — you could always reject axioms — but if you accepted quantum field
theory as a description of the physical world, and there was no observation
in the history of physics that suggested you should not, then the proof held.

Al-Rashid had been right. It was not evidence. It was proof.

The second wave of mathematicians came not to check the proof but to explore
its implications. These were the topologists and the set theorists and the
specialists in mathematical logic, and they brought with them the particular
exhilaration of people who have been given a new continent to map. If the
universe was a computation, then it had computational properties — an
architecture, a language, constraints, and possibly bugs — and these
properties were, at least in principle, discoverable. A new field crystallized
within weeks, unnamed at first and then christened, with the field's
characteristic blend of grandiosity and understatement, "substrate
mathematics."

Papers appeared on preprint servers with a frequency that overwhelmed the
capacity of peer review. A group at MIT claimed to have identified the
computational equivalent of a memory address in the fine structure of the
cosmic microwave background. A team in Moscow proposed that quantum
entanglement was not a physical phenomenon but a data-sharing protocol. A
lone mathematician in Kyoto published a paper arguing that the proof implied
the existence of other computations — other universes — running on the same
substrate, and that inter-computation communication might be possible. This
last paper was widely discussed and almost certainly wrong, but it had the
kind of wrongness that generates productive thinking, and it was cited four
hundred times in its first month.

Nadia read the papers. She read them all, or as many as she could, sitting at
her monitoring station with the signal cascading down her display and the
desert night pressing against the windows. She was not a mathematician, and
the technical details of substrate mathematics exceeded her training, but she
understood enough to follow the broad outlines, and what she understood
troubled her.

The proof was correct. She did not doubt this. But the proof was an answer,
and she had spent her career studying the question, and she knew something
about answers that the mathematicians, in their exhilaration, seemed to have
forgotten: an answer changes the asker. The universe was a simulation. Very
well. But the people who now knew this were still the same people who had
not known it last month — the same fallible, hopeful, frightened, astonishing
people who had been born into a universe they did not understand and had spent
their brief lives trying to make sense of it. The proof did not change the
universe. The universe had always been whatever it was. The proof changed
only the people who received it, and it changed them in ways that no
mathematical formalism could predict.

The governments responded as governments respond: with committees. The
United Nations convened an emergency session that produced, after eleven days
of debate, a resolution affirming that the signal was "a matter of profound
significance requiring further study" — which was the diplomatic equivalent
of saying nothing and meaning it. Individual nations were more decisive and
less helpful. The Soviet Union declared the signal a product of bourgeois
idealism and forbade its citizens from accessing the mathematical details,
which were available on every university preprint server in the world and
could not have been suppressed by an order of magnitude more censorship than
the Soviets possessed. The United States Congress held hearings at which
senators who could not balance a checkbook interrogated mathematicians about
the validity of formal proofs, with results that were predictable and
depressing. Three nations — Nadia did not bother to memorize which three —
declared national days of prayer. Two declared national days of mourning.
One declared both simultaneously, which struck Nadia as the most honest
response of all.

The philosophers arrived last, which was appropriate, because philosophy is
the discipline that takes the longest to say what it means. They came from
departments of metaphysics and epistemology and philosophy of science, and
they brought with them frameworks that the mathematicians found exasperating
and the public found incomprehensible: simulation theory, substrate
independence, the problem of other minds applied to computational entities,
the question of whether a computed consciousness could be said to suffer. A
philosopher at Oxford published a paper arguing that the proof was
self-refuting — that if the universe was a computation, then the proof
itself was computed, and a computed proof about computation had the same
epistemic status as a dream about dreaming. The paper was elegant,
ingenious, and wrong, but it generated more public discussion than any of
the mathematical papers, because it told people what they wanted to hear:
that the proof might not mean what it appeared to mean.

Nadia observed all of this from her monitoring station, and she began to
understand something about the relationship between knowledge and response
that her training in astrophysics had not equipped her to articulate. The
signal had delivered a fact. The fact was verified. But the fact, by itself,
was inert — it sat in the mathematical formalism like a stone in a field,
and it was the human beings who encountered the stone who decided whether
it was an obstacle or a foundation or a weapon or a monument. The proof did
not tell anyone what to do. It did not prescribe celebration or despair or
denial or indifference. It simply was, in the way that a measurement of the
cosmic microwave background simply was, or the observation of a supernova
simply was — data, stripped of instruction, waiting to be received by minds
that would inevitably, irresistibly, inescapably make it mean something.

She thought about this as she sat in her monitoring station through the
desert nights, listening to the signal repeat its patient cycle. She
thought about the original crew at the Array — Ferrara, al-Rashid, Park —
who had dispersed to conferences and committees and interview studios,
carrying the signal into the world like missionaries carrying a gospel they
themselves did not fully understand. She thought about the monitoring
station, which was quiet now, staffed by a skeleton crew of technicians who
checked the equipment and logged the data and did not, in Nadia's
observation, spend much time contemplating the philosophical implications
of what they were recording. They were doing their jobs. The signal was a
signal. Their job was to receive it.

Nadia found that she envied them.

                               V.

Six weeks after the signal's discovery, Nadia received a visitor.

His name was Father Miguel Escobar, and he was the parish priest of a small
church in the town of San Pedro de Atacama, thirty kilometers from the Array.
He was a short, weathered man with the hands of a laborer and the eyes of
someone who had looked at the desert for a long time and drawn conclusions
from it. He arrived at the monitoring station in a battered truck, wearing
his clerical collar and a dusty jacket, and he asked, with the politeness of
a man who understands that he is intruding, whether he might speak with the
woman who had found the signal.

Nadia agreed, mostly because she had not spoken to anyone outside the Array
in three days and was beginning to suspect that isolation was eroding her
judgment. They sat on folding chairs outside the monitoring station, in the
clear desert air, and drank coffee from the machine.

"I have come to ask you a question," Father Escobar said. "Not as a priest,
but as a man who is confused."

"I am also confused," Nadia said. "So we are well matched."

He smiled. "My question is this: Does the proof change anything?"

"It changes everything," Nadia said. "Or so I am told."

"By the mathematicians."

"By the mathematicians. By the philosophers. By the editorialists. By the
seventeen-year-old girl in Osaka, who thought it changed everything and could
not bear the change." She heard the flatness in her own voice and did not
attempt to soften it. "The proof says the universe is a computation. The
world hears this and asks: Does it matter? And the world divides in half
between those who say yes, everything is different, and those who say no,
nothing is different. I have been watching this division for six weeks, and I
cannot determine which half is right."

Father Escobar nodded slowly. He looked out at the desert, where the Array's
dishes caught the afternoon light and held it like cupped hands.

"In my church," he said, "there is an old woman named Rosa. She comes to mass
every Sunday. She has been coming for sixty years. Last week, after mass, she
asked me about the signal. I told her what I understood: that the universe was
proven to be a kind of computation, a thing made rather than a thing that
simply is. She thought about this for a long time. Then she said, 'Father,
does God still hear my prayers?' I told her I believed He did. She said,
'Then I will continue to pray.' And she went home."

"That is the indifference response," Nadia said.

"No," Father Escobar said. "It is not indifference. Rosa understood the proof
perfectly well. She is not a fool. She understood that her universe might be
a computation, that her body might be data, that her prayers might be nothing
more than patterns in a process she cannot comprehend. She understood all of
this. And she decided that it did not change the fact that she was alive, and
that she was speaking to something larger than herself, and that the act of
speaking mattered regardless of the mechanism by which her voice was carried."

Nadia said nothing for a while. The dishes turned on their mounts with the
slow, purposeful movement of sunflowers tracking the sun.

"The mathematicians are not wrong," she said finally. "The proof is correct.
The universe is a computation."

"I do not dispute this," Father Escobar said.

"Then what are you suggesting?"

He finished his coffee and set the cup on the ground beside his chair. "I
am suggesting that a proof tells you what is true. It does not tell you what
to do with the truth. The signal came from the stars. It told us something
about the nature of reality. Very well. But the question it has not
answered — the question it cannot answer — is the question that Rosa asked:
Does it still matter that I am here? Does the act of living still have
weight, even if the ground beneath it is made of mathematics?"

He stood up and shook her hand and drove back to San Pedro in his battered
truck, leaving Nadia alone with the signal and the desert and the question.

                               VI.

On the sixty-third day, Nadia made a decision.

She had spent the preceding weeks doing what she had always done: observing.
She observed the signal, which continued its 4.7-hour cycle with metronomic
regularity, repeating its proof with the patience of a teacher who does not
know whether the student has understood. She observed the world, which
continued its division into joy, despair, denial, and the thing she had
called indifference and now recognized as something else — something more
like fortitude. She observed the mathematicians, who had begun to develop
substrate mathematics with the fervent productivity of gold miners who have
struck a vein. She observed the philosophers, who were producing papers at
a rate that rivaled the mathematicians and with considerably less consensus.
She observed the theologians, who were engaging in debates of a sophistication
and ferocity not seen since the Council of Nicaea.

And she observed herself. This was the hardest observation, because she had
spent her career observing everything except herself, and the instrument was
uncalibrated. But she had the data. She knew what she felt.

She felt that the proof was correct and that it did not matter.

Not in the way the indifferent felt it did not matter — not because she was
too busy or too practical or too limited to grasp the implications. She
grasped them. She had grasped them on the first night, sitting at her
monitoring station with her coffee growing cold and the display burning red.
She grasped that the universe was a computation, that physical law was a
program, that matter and energy were processes rather than substances. She
grasped that her own consciousness — her memories, her preferences, her
love of strong coffee and desert silences — was a pattern in a substrate
she could not touch.

She grasped all of this, and she found that it did not change the thing she
wanted to do next, which was the same thing she had always wanted to do:
point a telescope at the sky and listen.

She thought about her father, who had died when she was twenty-two — a
factory worker in Novosibirsk who had never published a paper or attended a
conference but who had taught her, on winter evenings when the Siberian sky
was black and cold and blazing with stars, to look up. He had no scientific
vocabulary. He called the constellations by their Russian folk names. He did
not know that the light he was seeing had traveled for years or centuries or
millennia before reaching his eyes. But he looked up, and his looking was
sincere, and the sincerity was its own kind of knowledge — a knowledge that
preceded and survived any formal proof.

Her father had lived in a universe he did not understand, and he had found
it beautiful, and his finding it beautiful had not depended on understanding
it. Nadia suspected that this was the thing the proof could not touch: not
the facts of the universe, which were now altered, but the act of attending
to the universe, which was a human act and therefore governed by human
necessities rather than mathematical ones. The proof told her the universe
was computed. Her attention to the universe told her something the proof
could not: that the act of paying attention was its own justification, its
own reward, its own meaning, independent of whatever substrate supported it.

The signal had told her what the universe was. It had not told her what the
universe meant. This was not a failure of the signal — meaning was not the
kind of thing that could be encoded in a mathematical proof, any more than
the experience of color could be encoded in a wavelength measurement. The
proof was about structure. Meaning was about something else — about the
relationship between the observer and the thing observed, about the act of
paying attention, about the decision to keep listening even when you knew
what you would hear.

On the sixty-third day, Nadia filed a request with Ferrara for continued
observation time on the Bootes coordinates. He approved it without comment.
She returned to her monitoring station, sat down in her chair, and opened a
new log file.

"Observation continues," she typed. "Signal stable. Proof confirmed.
Questions remain."

She poured a fresh cup of coffee, black, no sugar, and turned her attention
to the signal from the stars.

Outside, the Atacama dishes turned in their slow arcs, gathering light from
a universe that was computed and was real and was, in ways that no proof
could diminish, worthy of the listening.

================================================================================

                       THE FLAYING OF MARSYAS

                        by Julian St. Croix

================================================================================

                               I.

Consider the skin.

Not as metaphor — we shall arrive at metaphor soon enough, as one always
does, as the Greeks always did, those tireless weavers of meaning from flesh
— but as fact, as the organ itself, the integument, the two square meters
of living architecture that separate the self from the not-self and in so
doing create the self, for without boundary there is no identity, without
surface there is no depth, without the thin, exquisite, infinitely sensitive
membrane that we call skin there is nothing but an uncontained spill of
viscera, an ontological puddle, a being without being.

Consider, further, what it means to remove the skin — not to puncture it,
not to wound it, but to remove it entirely, to strip the boundary between
self and world and leave the self exposed, the nerves bare, the interior
made exterior, the private made catastrophically public. This is what the
Greeks meant by the flaying of Marsyas: not merely a punishment but a
revelation, an act of forced truth in which the decorated surface is torn
away and the thing beneath — red, raw, screaming, alive — is shown to the
light. It is the oldest and most terrible metaphor in the aesthetic
tradition, and it persists because it names a fear that every artist carries
like a stone in the pocket: the fear that the work, however beautiful, is a
surface, and that beneath the surface there is something the artist would
rather not show, and that the showing of it is what art is ultimately for.

This is what the Keth-Anori understood, and what Elias Marsh — painter,
sculptor, graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, recipient of the
Fellowes Prize for Emerging Artists, human being, fool — did not understand
when he accepted their challenge.

But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let us begin, as the Greeks would
have insisted, at the beginning.

                               II.

The planet was called Anoria by the humans who had named it, which is to
say it was called nothing by anyone who mattered, because the Keth-Anori
did not name their world any more than a body names its own skin. The planet
was not a place they lived upon; it was an extension of themselves, a
sensory organ of planetary scale through which they experienced the universe
as a continuous aesthetic event. Every rock formation was a sculpture in
progress. Every weather pattern was a movement in an ongoing composition.
Every geological stratum was a page in a text that had been written over
four billion years and was not yet finished and would never be finished,
because for the Keth-Anori, the distinction between art and existence was
not a distinction at all.

Elias arrived on the second human expedition to Anoria, eighteen months after
first contact, in the capacity of "cultural liaison, arts specialization" — a
title invented by the Contact Bureau to justify sending an artist to an alien
world when there were, presumably, more practical uses for the berth. He was
thirty-one years old, slender, with the kind of angular face that photographs
well and a habit of wearing paint-stained clothing that was calculated to
suggest creative spontaneity but was in fact carefully curated. He carried
with him two hundred kilograms of art supplies, a digital archive of Earth's
visual art history from Lascaux to last Thursday, and the quiet, unexamined
certainty that beauty was a universal language and that he spoke it fluently.

The Keth-Anori were not what he had expected.

The xenobiology briefings had prepared him for their physical form: bilateral,
upright, roughly humanoid in silhouette, with skin that was their most
remarkable feature — a living chromatophoric surface capable of producing
color, texture, and pattern with a resolution and range that exceeded any
display technology humanity had devised. A Keth-Anori could make its skin
reproduce, with photographic fidelity, the appearance of any material,
surface, or image. They communicated partly through these displays — a
language of color and pattern that the linguists had barely begun to decode
— and their art, it had been reported, was primarily dermal. They made art
on and with and of their own bodies.

What the briefings had not prepared him for was the experience of standing
in the presence of beings for whom aesthetic perception was not a faculty
but a mode of existence. When the senior Keth-Anori delegate — a being the
humans called the Aesthete, though this was like calling the ocean "a body
of water" — entered the reception chamber for the first meeting, Elias felt
something he had never felt before in the presence of a work of art: terror.

The Aesthete's skin was displaying — performing, composing, being — a visual
experience that Elias could not process. Colors moved across the alien's
surface in patterns that were simultaneously abstract and representational,
geometric and organic, beautiful and disturbing, familiar and utterly alien.
It was as if Rothko and Bosch and Hokusai and the Sistine ceiling and a
coral reef and a thunderstorm had been compressed into a single, continuous,
living image that changed with each moment and was never the same twice. Elias
stood in the reception chamber with his mouth slightly open and his art
history archive heavy on his hip and realized, with the particular clarity
that precedes disaster, that he had been wrong about beauty being a universal
language. Beauty was a local dialect. He had arrived in a country where they
spoke something else.

                               III.

The challenge came on the thirty-seventh day.

Elias had spent the intervening weeks in a state of productive desperation.
He had set up a studio in the human compound — a converted storage bay with
good light and terrible ventilation — and he had worked. Not the measured,
deliberate work of his studio in Providence, where he had composed pieces
over weeks and months with the strategic patience of a chess player, but a
febrile, driven, almost panicked work, as if he were trying to prove to
himself that he could still make things that mattered.

He painted. He sculpted, using the modeling compounds he had brought and the
local stone he collected from the plateau outside the compound. He drew with
ink and charcoal and digital stylus. He worked in silence, mostly, and he
worked alone, and the work was — he could not deny it — good. Better,
perhaps, than anything he had made before, because it was made under
pressure, under the pressure of having seen something that exceeded his
capacity and discovering that his response to the excess was not surrender
but acceleration. The human body, it turned out, had a glandular response
to aesthetic inadequacy, and that response was production.

He also observed. He had been sent, after all, to observe — to document the
aesthetic practices of an alien civilization and to serve as a bridge
between two traditions of making. He walked the Anorian landscape with his
sketchbook and his camera and the Keth-Anori guide who had been assigned to
him, a younger being called the Apprentice, whose skin displays were less
elaborate than the Aesthete's but whose willingness to communicate with the
human visitor was considerably greater.

The Apprentice showed him things. It showed him the stone arrangements on
the western plateau that the Keth-Anori regarded as their most ancient art
— vast geometric patterns carved into the bedrock over centuries, visible
only from altitude, their lines following the planet's magnetic field in a
way that the human geologists found baffling and the Keth-Anori found
self-evident. It showed him the sound gardens, enclosed valleys where the
wind passing through shaped rock formations produced complex harmonics that
the Keth-Anori experienced as music and that Elias experienced as something
between music and architecture — a structured sound that occupied physical
space in a way that his human categories could not quite accommodate. It
showed him the skin ceremonies, in which groups of Keth-Anori synchronized
their dermal displays into a single, collective composition that lasted
for hours and that the Apprentice described, using the limited human
vocabulary it had acquired, as "the largest truth we can tell together."

Elias sketched everything. He filled twelve notebooks with drawings,
annotations, color studies, and the increasingly desperate marginal notes
of an artist who recognized that he was encountering a tradition so vast
and so alien that his own tradition — the entire tradition of human visual
art, from the cave paintings to the galleries of New York — was a footnote
in a library he had not known existed.

He began to understand, dimly and with the resistance of a man watching the
foundations of his identity shift beneath him, that the Keth-Anori did not
distinguish between art and life. This was not a metaphor. It was not the
kind of thing that artists said at cocktail parties — "my art is my life,
darling" — while holding a glass of wine and meaning nothing more profound
than that they spent a lot of time in the studio. The Keth-Anori meant it
literally. Their aesthetic practice was not something they did; it was
something they were. The skin displays were not performances; they were
states of being, as involuntary and as fundamental as breathing or dreaming.
A Keth-Anori that ceased to produce aesthetic experience would not be an
artist who had stopped working. It would be a being that had ceased to exist
in any way that the Keth-Anori recognized as existence.

This understanding made the challenge, when it came, both inevitable and
terrifying.

The Keth-Anori visited his studio. They came singly and in small groups,
gliding through the corridors of the human compound with a fluid grace that
made the human crew look like marionettes with tangled strings. They
examined his work in silence, their skin flickering with patterns too rapid
and too complex for him to read. He did not know whether they were admiring
or pitying or analyzing or ignoring. Their aesthetic responses were as
illegible to him as a medical chart in Mandarin.

On the thirty-seventh day, the Aesthete came.

It was the first time the senior being had visited the human compound since
the initial reception. It entered Elias's studio and stood before a large
canvas he had been working on for three days — an abstract piece, a field of
deep indigo broken by veins of white and gold that he had intended as a
representation of the Anorian sky at twilight, seen through human eyes. The
Aesthete studied it. Its skin displayed nothing — an unprecedented stillness
that the linguists would later describe as "the null register," a state of
aesthetic attention so intense that all output was suspended in favor of pure
input.

Then the Aesthete spoke. It spoke in the humans' language — not fluently,
but comprehensibly, having learned it from the expedition's translation
databases with a speed that the linguists found humbling.

"This is your best," the Aesthete said.

"It is my most recent," Elias said. "I don't know if it's my best."

"It is your best," the Aesthete repeated, with the flat certainty of
diagnosis. "I have seen all of your work in this place. This is the piece
in which you have come closest to expressing what you are capable of
expressing. It is beautiful."

The word, in the Aesthete's mouth, had a quality that Elias could not
identify. It was not praise. It was not condemnation. It was something
between — a clinical observation, a notation in a chart.

"Thank you," Elias said, because he did not know what else to say.

"I wish to propose an exchange," the Aesthete said. "A competition. In your
cultural tradition, you have a practice in which two artists produce works
and a judgment is rendered. We have an equivalent practice. The stakes, in
both traditions, are significant."

"What kind of competition?"

"You will produce a work. I will produce a work. They will be judged by
criteria that I will explain. The judgment will be binding."

"Binding how?"

The Aesthete's skin rippled — a single wave of color, dark to light, that
passed over its entire surface like a shudder. "The loser," it said,
"forfeits the capacity to create."

Elias felt something cold move through his chest. "You mean symbolically."

"I mean precisely. The Keth-Anori possess the surgical capability to excise
the neurological structures that produce creative impulse. The procedure is
permanent and painless. It is the traditional consequence of aesthetic
failure in our most significant competitions."

"That's barbaric."

"That is the price," the Aesthete said. "Art that carries no risk is not
art. It is decoration. You may decline. There is no dishonor in declining."

Elias looked at his painting — the indigo field, the veins of light, the
best thing he had ever made. He thought of the Aesthete's skin, the
impossible compositions that moved across it like weather across a planet.
He thought of the word beautiful in the Aesthete's mouth, and how it had
sounded like a diagnosis.

"I accept," he said.

He did not understand why he accepted. He would spend the rest of his life
trying to understand why he accepted.

                               IV.

The competition was held in a natural amphitheater on the plateau above the
human compound, a bowl of red stone open to the Anorian sky, which was the
color of a bruise — deep purple at the zenith shading to green at the
horizon, lit by a sun that was cooler and larger than Sol and cast a light
that made everything look as though it were being remembered rather than
seen.

The Keth-Anori gathered in concentric circles around the amphitheater's
floor, hundreds of them, their skin displays synchronized in a pattern of
muted earth tones that the linguists later identified as "formal attention."
The human crew stood in a loose group at the amphitheater's rim, uneasy and
fascinated, aware that they were witnessing something they did not fully
understand.

Elias had been given thirty Anorian days to prepare. He had used every one of
them. He had worked with a focus and an intensity that frightened him,
producing and discarding piece after piece, driving himself toward something
he could feel but not name — a quality that lay beyond beauty, beyond
technique, beyond anything he had been taught or had taught himself. He slept
three hours a night. He lost weight. His hands developed a tremor that
disappeared only when he was working, which told him something about the
relationship between creation and control that he did not want to know.

He discarded fourteen pieces during those thirty days. A painting of the
Anorian landscape that was technically accomplished and emotionally vacant.
A series of mixed-media assemblages that attempted to incorporate Keth-Anori
aesthetic principles and succeeded only in demonstrating how poorly he
understood them. A portrait of the Aesthete rendered from memory that
captured the alien's physical form with forensic accuracy and missed
everything that mattered — the presence, the weight, the terrifying
aesthetic authority that had nothing to do with what the Aesthete looked
like and everything to do with what the Aesthete was.

On the nineteenth day, the Apprentice visited his studio. It studied the
discarded works, which Elias had piled in a corner like casualties. Its
skin displayed a pattern he had not seen before — slow, muted waves of
grey and amber that reminded him, irrationally, of sympathy.

"You are trying to make something that is not you," the Apprentice said.

"I am trying to make something that is true," Elias said.

"Those are the same statement. The truest thing an artist can make is the
thing that is most fully themselves. You are making things that are partly
yourself and partly what you think we wish to see. The division weakens
the work."

"Your Aesthete said my painting was beautiful."

"Yes. Your beauty is genuine. It is the strongest quality in your work. But
you are trying to suppress it, to reach past it toward something you think
is deeper. This is a mistake. Your depth is in your beauty. It is the only
depth you have. If you abandon it, you will have nothing."

Elias stared at the Apprentice. He wanted to be offended — the assessment
was brutal in its clinical precision — but he recognized, with the shock of
someone encountering a mirror in an unexpected place, that the Apprentice
was right. His beauty was the only depth he had. It was the thing he did
that no one else did, the quality that made his work recognizably his, and
he had spent nineteen days trying to be someone else, trying to make
Keth-Anori art with human hands, trying to transcend his own tradition
instead of inhabiting it fully.

He destroyed every piece he had made in the last nineteen days and started
over. He worked for eleven days without stopping except to sleep and eat,
and what he made was the most beautiful thing he had ever made, and he knew
it was the most beautiful thing he had ever made, and he knew, with a
certainty that sat in his stomach like a stone, that it might not be enough.

The piece he brought to the amphitheater was a sculpture.

It stood two meters tall, carved from Anorian stone — a dense, fine-grained
material the color of dried blood — and it was, by any human standard, a
masterpiece. It depicted a figure that was neither human nor Keth-Anori but
something between — something that existed only in the space between two
species' ways of seeing. The figure was reaching upward, its body twisted
in a gesture that suggested both aspiration and anguish, and its surface
was carved with a pattern of fine lines that caught the Anorian light and
transformed it into a web of shadows that shifted as the viewer moved. It
was beautiful in the way that great sculpture is beautiful: it occupied
space with the authority of something that had always been there and would
always be there, as if it had not been made but discovered, excavated from
the stone like an archaeological find.

The human crew applauded. Several of the xenobiologists wept. The expedition
commander, a practical woman named Hayashi who had no patience for art under
normal circumstances, stood before the sculpture for a full minute in
silence and then said, "Marsh, you son of a bitch."

The Keth-Anori said nothing. Their skin displays remained in the muted
earth tones of formal attention, and Elias could not read them. He stood
beside his sculpture in the red light of the Anorian afternoon and waited
for the Aesthete to present its work.

                               V.

The Aesthete stepped into the center of the amphitheater and began.

What it produced was not a sculpture or a painting or a performance in any
sense that Elias could categorize. It was a display — a composition enacted
on the Aesthete's own skin, spreading from the being's chest to its
extremities and then beyond, projected by some mechanism Elias did not
understand onto the stone floor of the amphitheater and the air above it,
so that the entire space became a canvas on which the Aesthete painted with
light and color and movement.

The composition lasted eleven minutes.

Elias watched it, and what he experienced was not beauty.

The Aesthete's work was ugly. Deliberately, systematically, comprehensively
ugly. It was a riot of clashing colors and discordant forms, a visual noise
that assaulted the senses with the same relentlessness that a jackhammer
assaults the street. There was no harmony in it, no grace, no balance, no
compositional logic that Elias could identify. It was, by every principle of
aesthetics he had been trained to apply — proportion, rhythm, unity, emphasis,
the golden section, the rule of thirds, the entire accumulated wisdom of
ten thousand years of human visual culture — a failure. It was the worst
thing he had ever seen.

And yet.

As the composition continued, Elias became aware that he was crying. Not
from distress, not from beauty, but from recognition. The Aesthete's work
was not depicting anything. It was not representing or symbolizing or
abstracting. It was enacting something — a truth, a fundamental truth about
existence, about the nature of consciousness in a universe that did not care
whether consciousness existed, about the experience of being a sensing being
in a senseless cosmos, about the raw, unmediated, unbeautified fact of
perception itself. It was showing him what it felt like to see — not to see
beauty, not to see meaning, not to see pattern, but simply to see, to
receive the full unfiltered blast of sensory data that the universe produced
at every moment and that every conscious being spent its life filtering,
sorting, organizing, and aestheticizing into something bearable.

The Aesthete's work was not beautiful because beauty was a defense mechanism.
Beauty was the skin that consciousness grew over the wound of perception.
Beauty was the way a mind protected itself from the overwhelming truth of
what it meant to be alive and aware in a universe of infinite, chaotic,
indifferent stimulation. The Aesthete had removed the skin. It had shown the
wound. And the wound was true.

The composition ended. The amphitheater was silent.

Elias stood beside his beautiful sculpture — his masterpiece, his finest
work, the best thing he had ever made — and he understood, with a clarity
that felt like a blade, that he had lost.

                               VI.

The judgment was rendered by the assembled Keth-Anori through a collective
display — a wave of color that passed through the concentric circles like a
stone dropped in a pond. The linguists would later translate the judgment
as: "The visitor's work is beautiful. The Aesthete's work is true. Truth
supersedes beauty. The judgment is for the Aesthete."

Elias did not contest the judgment. He could not. He had seen the Aesthete's
work, and he knew the judgment was correct. This was the worst part — worse
than losing, worse than the consequence — the knowledge that the judgment
was correct, that beauty was not the highest aesthetic value, that the thing
he had spent his life pursuing was a subsidiary quality, a decoration on the
surface of a deeper and more terrible achievement.

The human crew protested. Commander Hayashi filed a formal objection with
the Contact Bureau's representative, arguing that the competition violated
the expedition's charter, which prohibited human participation in alien
cultural practices involving bodily harm. The xenoanthropologist, Dr. Chen,
argued that cultural relativism had limits and that those limits were
reached when a cultural practice involved the involuntary destruction of a
human being's cognitive function. The expedition physician refused to
authorize the procedure on medical-ethical grounds and threatened to report
the entire affair to the Colonial Medical Board.

Elias listened to all of this from his quarters, where he sat on his
narrow bunk and stared at his hands — the hands that had carved the
sculpture, that had held the chisel and the brush and the charcoal, that
had been the instruments through which his creative impulse had entered the
physical world — and he understood something that his well-meaning
colleagues did not. The competition had not been coerced. He had accepted
freely. He had accepted because he had believed, with the arrogance that
is inseparable from genuine talent, that his beauty could contend with
their truth. He had been wrong. And the wrongness was not an injustice
that could be protested or a harm that could be remedied. It was a fact —
as factual as the red stone of the amphitheater, as factual as the judgment
that had been rendered, as factual as the Aesthete's eleven minutes of
devastating, ugly, irrefutable truth.

He overruled Hayashi. He overruled Chen. He told the physician that the
procedure was his choice and that his choice was final. He did this not
from courage — he was not courageous; he was terrified — but from
the same quality that had made him accept the challenge in the first
place: the refusal to pretend that the truth was other than it was.

The surgery was performed the following day.

The Keth-Anori surgeon was gentle and precise. Elias was conscious
throughout — the Keth-Anori did not believe in rendering the patient
insensible during a procedure of aesthetic significance — and he felt no pain.
What he felt was a subtraction. Not a cutting or a removal but a diminishment,
as if the volume of the world were being turned down, not to silence but to
a level at which the music, while still audible, no longer compelled the
listener to dance.

When it was done, he could still see color. He could still appreciate
composition. He could still recognize beauty when he encountered it, the way
a retired athlete can still recognize a fine performance. But the drive — the
compulsion, the hunger, the ache that had propelled him into his studio every
morning for fifteen years, the thing that woke him in the night with images
behind his eyes demanding to be made real — was gone. The surgeon had excised
it with the precision of a jeweler removing a stone from a setting, and the
setting remained but the stone was gone, and the setting, without the stone,
was just metal.

                               VII.

He returned to Earth on the next scheduled transport, seven months later.

His sculpture remained on Anoria, in the amphitheater where it had been
judged and found beautiful and found insufficient. The Keth-Anori did not
destroy it. They placed it at the center of the amphitheater, where it
stood among the red stones under the bruised sky, and they visited it
regularly, and their skin displays, when they looked at it, produced
patterns that the linguists could not translate.

Elias lived for another forty-two years. He taught art history at a small
college in Vermont, and his students described him as knowledgeable and kind
and inexplicably sad, and he never told them why. He visited galleries and
museums and stood before great paintings and felt a distant, respectful
appreciation that was indistinguishable from grief. He did not paint. He did
not sculpt. He did not draw. Not because he had been forbidden, but because
the thing that had made these acts necessary — the impulse, the compulsion,
the creative urgency that had been as much a part of his identity as his
name — had been excised, cleanly and permanently, on a red plateau under an
alien sky.

The voyage home was seven months of silence. He sat in his cabin aboard the
transport and looked at his hands and tried to remember what it had felt
like to be driven by the need to make something. The memory was vivid — he
could recall the sensation of the chisel in his palm, the resistance of
stone, the moment when the form began to emerge from the material like a
figure stepping out of fog — but the memory was a recording, not an
experience. He could play it back. He could not inhabit it. The difference
was the difference between remembering the taste of bread and actually
tasting bread, and it was a difference that he would carry for the rest of
his life.

His colleagues on the transport treated him with an uneasy kindness.
Commander Hayashi, who had opposed the surgery and who blamed herself for
not preventing it — though it had not been hers to prevent — brought him
meals and sat with him in the observation lounge and did not try to talk
about art. Dr. Chen, the xenoanthropologist, attempted once to discuss the
cultural implications of the competition and the judgment, and Elias
listened politely and said nothing, because the cultural implications
were irrelevant to the personal fact, which was that he was a man who had
been an artist and was now a man who had been an artist, the tense shift
being the entirety of the catastrophe.

He taught art history at a small college in Vermont, and his students
described him as knowledgeable and kind and inexplicably sad, and he never
told them why. He taught them about Caravaggio and Vermeer and Rothko and
Pollock, and he spoke about these artists with an authority and an
intensity that his students found moving without understanding its source.
He was not teaching them about art. He was teaching them about a country
he had once inhabited and could no longer visit, and the specificity of his
descriptions — the angle of light in Vermeer, the weight of paint in
Pollock, the way Caravaggio used darkness not as the absence of light but
as a presence, a force, a character — had the quality of testimony, of a
witness describing a place he has seen with his own eyes and will never see
again. He visited galleries and museums and stood before great paintings
and felt a distant, respectful appreciation that was indistinguishable from
grief. He did not paint. He did not sculpt. He did not draw. Not because
he had been forbidden, but because the thing that had made these acts
necessary — the impulse, the compulsion, the creative urgency that had been
as much a part of his identity as his name — had been excised, cleanly and
permanently, on a red plateau under an alien sky.

He thought often of Marsyas.

In the Greek myth, the satyr Marsyas challenged Apollo to a musical contest,
and Apollo — the god, the embodiment of art itself — won, and the penalty for
losing was to be flayed alive. The myth was usually read as a warning against
hubris, against the folly of mortals who dare to compete with gods. But Elias,
in his later years, came to read it differently. Marsyas was not punished for
his hubris. He was punished for his beauty. He had played beautifully, and
his beauty was real, and it was not enough, because beauty was never the point.
Apollo did not flay Marsyas because Marsyas was arrogant. Apollo flayed him
because the skin — the beautiful, decorated, carefully maintained skin — was
the thing that stood between Marsyas and the truth, and the truth was
underneath, and the truth was red and raw and terrible and more important
than any music ever played.

The Keth-Anori had understood this. They had understood it for four billion
years, which was approximately four billion years longer than Elias Marsh,
painter, sculptor, graduate of the Rhode Island School of Design, recipient
of the Fellowes Prize for Emerging Artists, human being, fool.

On clear nights, when the Vermont sky was dark enough to see the stars, Elias
sometimes stood on his porch and looked up at the constellation Bootes, where
Anoria orbited its cool, large sun, and he felt — felt, not thought, not
intellectualized, but felt in the body, in the skin — the faintest echo of
something that had once been the center of his life. It was like hearing
music from a neighboring apartment: present, recognizable, and impossibly
far away.

He did not weep. He had wept enough. He stood on his porch and looked at the
stars and felt the echo and went inside and closed the door and lived the
rest of his life as a man who had once been an artist and was now something
else — something unnamed, something flayed, something that had stood in the
presence of truth and survived it and carried the scar where the beautiful
skin had been.

The sculpture on Anoria, under the bruised sky, continued to be beautiful.

The Keth-Anori continued to visit it, and their skin displays continued to
produce patterns the linguists could not translate.

It is possible — though Elias never knew this, and it would not have
consoled him if he had — that the patterns meant something close to gratitude.

                          THE LAST SIGNAL

                        by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

The ship was called Varden, which in the old language meant guardian, though
there was no one left to guard.

Saga Lindgren sat in the communications bay and composed the signal. She
was the last. She had known she would be the last for eleven years, since
the failure of the hydroponics bay on Deck Seven had made the mathematics
of survival inescapable, and she had spent those eleven years preparing for
this moment with the methodical patience of a woman who understood that
some tasks could not be hurried.

The communications bay was a small room at the forward end of the ship's
central spine. It contained a transmitter, a directional antenna array, a
chair, and a console. The console's surface was scratched and worn. Twelve
generations of hands had worked at this console, sending signals outward
into the dark: status reports, navigational updates, the small and
necessary transmissions of a vessel in transit. The last signal received
from Earth had arrived in Generation Four. It had said: "We hear you. We
are here." After that, silence. Whether Earth had stopped listening or
stopped transmitting or stopped existing, no one aboard the Varden had
ever learned.

Saga was sixty-one years old. She had been born on the ship, as had her
mother and her mother's mother and every ancestor back to the original crew
of two hundred who had departed Earth orbit four hundred and twelve years
ago, bound for a star called Kepler-442 that they would never reach. The
Varden's engines had failed in Generation Three. The repair had been
attempted and had failed again in Generation Five. After that, the ship had
continued on momentum alone, a ballistic object following a trajectory that
would carry it past the target star at a distance of four light-years,
close enough to see but not to reach, like a stone skipping past an island
on its way to the open sea.

The ship had not been dying. It had been ending. There is a difference.
Dying implies struggle, the body fighting against its dissolution. Ending
is quieter. The Varden's population had declined not through catastrophe
but through arithmetic: fewer births than deaths, each generation smaller
than the last, the curve descending with the gentle inevitability of a
breath released. Generation Twelve had numbered nine. Generation Thirteen
had numbered three. Now there was Saga, and after Saga there would be the
ship, empty and dark, continuing its trajectory through the interstellar
medium for ten thousand years or a hundred thousand years or a million
years, until some force — a gravitational perturbation, a collision with a
dust cloud, the slow erosion of time — brought it to rest.

She was not composing a distress signal. There was no one to rescue her,
and she did not wish to be rescued. She was composing something else.

She began with the names.

All of them. Every person who had lived and died aboard the Varden across
twelve generations: the original crew of two hundred, and their children,
and their children's children, down through the centuries to the last nine,
the last three, and herself. She had spent four years compiling the list
from the ship's records — birth logs, death logs, the informal journals
that crewmembers had kept in the margins of maintenance manuals and on the
blank sides of navigational charts. Fourteen hundred and seven names. She
encoded them in the signal's header, a long sequence of phonetic
transcriptions that would, if anyone ever received and decoded the
transmission, reconstitute the sounds of fourteen hundred and seven names
spoken aloud.

After the names, she composed the account.

Not a history. She had no interest in history, which was a record of events,
and events were not what mattered. She composed instead an account of what
the voyage had meant — what it had felt like to live between stars, in the
space between departure and arrival, in the long, luminous emptiness that
was not empty at all but full of the small, fierce, ordinary acts by which
human beings make a life.

She wrote about the garden that Generation Three had planted in the
observation lounge, growing tomatoes and marigolds in recycled soil under
artificial light, and how the smell of the tomato plants — green and sharp
and alive — had become the ship's most treasured sensory experience,
passed down through generations as a kind of olfactory heirloom. She wrote
about the music. Generation Six had produced a composer, Karin Holm, who
had written forty-seven pieces for instruments that existed nowhere else in
the universe — instruments built from ship components, from conduit pipes
and hull plating and the tension cables of defunct machinery — and whose
music sounded like nothing that had ever been heard on Earth, a music of
transit, of between, of the particular loneliness that is also a particular
freedom.

She wrote about the marriages and the arguments and the long silences and
the laughter. She wrote about the woman in Generation Eight who had
memorized every poem in the ship's literary database and recited them in
the corridors at night, her voice carrying through the ventilation system
like a ghost. She wrote about the man in Generation Ten who had spent
thirty years painting the walls of Deck Four with a mural that depicted
the Earth as the ship's inhabitants imagined it — not as it was, because
no one alive had ever seen it, but as it lived in the collective memory:
green and blue and impossibly beautiful, a planet of legend, a place that
existed now only in the minds of people who were themselves ceasing to
exist.

She wrote about the children. Every generation had children, even the last
generations, when the mathematics of the ending was already known. She wrote
about the argument in Generation Eleven — the last generation large enough
to argue — over whether it was cruel to bring children into a world that
was ending. The argument had been fierce and unresolved and ultimately
irrelevant, because the children came anyway, as children do, indifferent
to the mathematics of their situation, interested only in being alive. The
last child born on the Varden was a girl named Astrid, born in Generation
Twelve, who had lived forty-one years and died of pneumonia and who had
spent her life maintaining the ship's water recycling system with a
meticulous care that was, Saga wrote, its own form of art.

She wrote about the funerals. The Varden had no soil for burial and no
atmosphere for burning, so the dead were given to space — placed in the
airlock in their best clothes and released into the void, where they joined
the ship's trajectory and traveled alongside it, a silent procession of the
departed keeping pace with the living at the same velocity and the same
heading, bound for the same nowhere.

She wrote about her own life. The small things. The morning ritual of
checking the atmospheric processors. The way the ship hummed at a
frequency she could feel in her teeth. The view from the observation port
on Deck Two, where the stars were not points of light but presences,
companions, the silent witnesses to a voyage that no one had asked for and
no one could end and no one, in twelve generations of living it, had
ever regretted.

She wrote about the last night with her mother, who had died when Saga was
forty-nine. Her mother had held her hand and said, "Tell them we were here."
Saga had not asked who "them" meant. She had understood. Them was anyone.
Them was the universe. Them was the future, which would exist whether or
not anyone was present to inhabit it.

The signal, when she had finished composing it, was not long. It could be
transmitted in six hours. It would travel at the speed of light toward
Earth, which was now approximately four hundred light-years away, and it
would arrive — if the antenna alignment held, if the signal strength was
sufficient, if there was anyone listening — in four centuries.

Four hundred years. Twice the age of the voyage itself.

Saga initiated the transmission. The antenna array oriented itself toward
the coordinates where Earth had been when the Varden departed, corrected
for stellar drift. The transmitter drew power from the ship's remaining
reserves. The signal left the antenna at the speed of light and entered
the interstellar medium and began its journey.

She sat in the communications bay and listened to the transmitter's hum.
Outside the hull, the stars burned in their ancient patterns. The ship
moved through the dark on its long, slow, purposeless trajectory, carrying
its cargo of empty rooms and silent corridors and the fading warmth of a
thousand lives toward the deep future.

The signal would arrive at Earth in the year 2789. Saga would be four
centuries dead. The Varden would be a cold artifact tumbling through space,
its atmosphere leaked away, its corridors open to vacuum, its garden long
since returned to dust. But the signal would arrive, carrying fourteen
hundred and seven names and the account of what their lives had meant,
and if anyone heard it — if anyone was there, in that distant year, to
point a receiver at the sky and listen — they would know.

Not that the Varden had failed. Not that the voyage had been a tragedy.
But that twelve generations of human beings had lived in the space between
stars, and had made music, and had grown tomatoes, and had painted the
Earth from memory, and had loved each other, and had died, and had been
real, and had mattered, and had sent this signal not because they expected
an answer but because the act of sending — the act of saying we were here
to a universe that had not asked and did not care — was itself the point,
was itself the meaning, was itself enough.

Saga turned off the console. The transmitter continued its work.

She walked to the observation port on Deck Two and looked out at the stars.
They were very bright. They were very far away. She was the last, and
she was not afraid, and the signal was traveling, and that was enough.

================================================================================

                            SANCTUARY

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The planet was called Haven, and it was the only neutral world in twelve
systems.

It was not a beautiful world. The sky was the color of old pewter, the
terrain a rolling plateau of grey-brown rock and sparse, tough vegetation
that bore no resemblance to anything that grew on Earth or Callisto or any
of the established colony worlds. The wind blew constantly — not violently,
but persistently, a low moan that became the background frequency of every
conversation, every meal, every sleepless night. The settlement's founders
had chosen the name Haven with the grim irony of people who understood that
safety did not require beauty and that the absence of beauty might itself
be a form of safety: no one would covet this place, and in a war,
uncoveted places were the last refuge.

Commander Ruth Okafor stood at the edge of the landing field and watched
the second transport come down through the cloud cover, its heat shields
trailing orange fire that dissipated in the thin upper atmosphere like a
struck match. The transport was Callistoan — she could tell by the engine
configuration, the fat exhaust bells characteristic of the Callisto yards —
and it was carrying refugees from the siege of Prometheus Station. Callistoan
refugees. The same people whose government had, six months ago, ordered the
bombardment of the settlement at Dione that had killed two hundred and twelve
civilians, including Ruth's sister.

She had been told this morning that the transport was coming. Director Yseult
Caron, who ran Haven with the implacable efficiency of a woman who had
decided that civilization would survive whether it wanted to or not, had
come to Ruth's office and placed the manifest on her desk.

"Forty-seven refugees," Caron had said. "Thirty-one civilians, eight
medical, eight children. They lost everything at Prometheus."

"Prometheus was a military installation," Ruth said.

"Prometheus was a station with a military section and a civilian section.
The Terran Alliance did not distinguish between them when they fired.
Forty-seven survivors. They have nowhere else to go."

Ruth looked at the manifest. Names, ages, occupations. A schoolteacher, two
engineers, a doctor, a baker, three nurses, a poet. Eight children between
the ages of two and eleven. She did not look at their faces. The manifest
included photographs, and she was not ready for photographs.

"I'm the wrong person for this," she said.

"You're the settlement coordinator. This is a settlement matter."

"My sister died at Dione. The Callistoan government ordered the strike
on Dione."

"Yes," Caron said. "And the Terran Alliance just destroyed Prometheus. The
war does not distinguish between the guilty and the innocent. Neither can
we, if Haven is to mean anything."

Ruth had wanted to argue. She had wanted to say that neutrality was a
political position, not a moral one, and that there was a difference between
refusing to take sides in a war and inviting the people who had killed your
family to live next door. But Caron's eyes — steady, grey, exhausted — had
stopped her. Caron had lost people too. Everyone on Haven had lost people.
That was why they were here.

Now she stood at the edge of the landing field with her clipboard and her
manifest and watched the transport settle onto its landing struts with a
hydraulic groan. The hatch opened. The refugees came out.

They looked like refugees everywhere: stunned, depleted, carrying their
remaining possessions in bags and bundles, blinking in the unfamiliar
sunlight of a world they had never visited and had not chosen. The children
held the hands of adults who held the hands of other adults. A woman near
the front of the group was carrying a baby and a suitcase and the
particular expression of someone who has not slept in three days and has
forgotten what sleep is.

Ruth walked across the field to meet them. Her legs felt strange, as if the
gravity had changed, though Haven's gravity was the same 0.87 standard it
had always been.

"My name is Commander Ruth Okafor," she said. "I'm the settlement
coordinator for Haven. You are welcome here."

The words came out flat and procedural, which was how she had intended them.
Welcome was the protocol. Welcome was what you said. It did not require
that you mean it.

The woman with the baby looked at her. "Okafor," she said. "That name. Are
you related to Amara Okafor?"

The air went out of Ruth's lungs. "She was my sister."

The woman's face changed. Not to guilt, not to pity, but to something Ruth
had not expected: recognition. The recognition of one damaged person
encountering another.

"I'm sorry," the woman said. "I knew her name from the reports. I'm sorry
for what happened at Dione."

Ruth did not know what to say. She had rehearsed several responses, all of
them inadequate. She said, "Let me show you to your quarters."

                               II.

Haven had been established four years earlier by a coalition of neutral
governments who had looked at the expanding war between the Terran Alliance
and the Callistoan Federation and concluded that someone needed to build a
place where the displaced could go. The planet was marginal — a rocky world
at the outer edge of its star's habitable zone, cold and dry and not
particularly inviting — but it had breathable atmosphere and liquid water
and, most importantly, it was claimed by no one. Its very inadequacy was
its qualification. No one would fight over Haven because Haven was not worth
fighting over.

The settlement had grown to three thousand people. About sixty percent were
Terran, about thirty percent were Callistoan, and the remaining ten percent
were from the neutral worlds — administrators like Caron, medical personnel,
engineers, the small army of practical people required to keep a marginal
colony functional. The Terrans and the Callistoans lived in the same
settlement, used the same water recyclers, ate in the same dining halls,
sent their children to the same school.

They did not like each other. This was not required. Caron's rules were
specific and limited: no violence, no sabotage, no refusal of essential
cooperation. You did not have to speak to your neighbor. You did not have
to forgive your neighbor. You had to share the water recycler with your
neighbor, and you had to refrain from killing your neighbor, and beyond
that your feelings were your own business.

It was, Ruth reflected, the minimum viable definition of peace: not harmony,
not reconciliation, not the warm glow of mutual understanding, but the cold,
functional, unglamorous agreement to coexist. It worked the way a machine
works — not because its parts loved each other but because each part
performed its function and the whole, thereby, continued to operate.

Ruth had been on Haven for two years. She had arrived on one of the early
Terran transports, after Dione, after the memorial service that had been
held on a station orbiting Mars where someone had played "Amazing Grace"
on a trumpet and Ruth had stood with her hands at her sides and felt nothing
at all. She had come to Haven because she could not stay in Terran space,
where every conversation circled back to the war and every face reminded
her of Amara's face and the absence of Amara's face. She had come to Haven
because she needed a place where the war was not the primary fact of
existence, and Haven was the only such place.

She had discovered, upon arrival, that the war was still the primary fact
of existence on Haven. It was simply expressed differently. In Terran space,
the war was expressed through weapons and strategy and the rhetoric of
righteous cause. On Haven, the war was expressed through silences — the
silence between a Terran woman and the Callistoan man who sat across from
her in the dining hall, the silence between children who had been told in
half-heard whispers that those other children were the enemy, the silence
that filled the corridors of the settlement like an invisible gas,
odorless and pervasive and suffocating.

Ruth's job was to manage the logistics of coexistence: housing assignments,
work schedules, resource allocation, the thousand small decisions that
determined whether people who hated each other would have to stand in line
together for water rations. She was good at this work because she approached
it without sentiment. She did not believe in reconciliation. She believed
in plumbing.

Plumbing was not a metaphor, or not only a metaphor. The settlement's
physical infrastructure was her responsibility, and it was through
infrastructure that she had come to understand the mechanics of coexistence.
Water recycling was the clearest example. Haven had a single water
recycling system that served all three thousand residents. The system did not
distinguish between Terran water and Callistoan water. A molecule of H2O
that had passed through a Callistoan kidney was, after processing,
indistinguishable from a molecule that had passed through a Terran kidney,
and both were indistinguishable from the water that fell as rain on Haven's
rocky plateau. The recycler was the settlement's most powerful argument
for coexistence, because it demonstrated, with the irrefutable logic of
chemistry, that human bodies were made of the same materials regardless of
which government had sent them into space.

Ruth had attempted, in her first year, to explain this insight to a Terran
resident who was refusing to drink water from a tap that also served a
Callistoan family. The man had listened politely and then said, "Ma'am, I
know it's the same water. I just don't want to drink it." Ruth had
understood, in that moment, that the logic of chemistry was insufficient.
The man's objection was not about water. It was about proximity — about the
intolerable awareness that the people who had killed his friends were alive
and breathing and drinking water on the same planet, and that every sip
from the shared tap was a reminder that the universe did not organize itself
along the lines of justice.

She had not argued further. She had simply left the tap where it was,
because the tap was where it needed to be, and eventually the man drank
from it, because thirst is a more powerful argument than politics.

                               III.

The woman with the baby was named Lena Vasik. She was a structural engineer
from Prometheus Station, thirty-four years old, and the baby — a boy named
Piotr — was seven months old and had spent the first three months of his
life in the evacuation shelter beneath Prometheus while the Terran Alliance
bombarded the station above. Lena's husband had been killed in the first
strike. She did not discuss this. Ruth learned it from the manifest.

Ruth assigned Lena and the other Callistoan refugees to housing in Sector
Four, which was the newest section of the settlement and the one farthest
from the Terran-majority sectors. This was practical, not political: Sector
Four had the most available units. But Ruth was aware that the separation
served another purpose, and she did not pretend otherwise.

Three days after the refugees arrived, the trouble started.

It was not dramatic trouble. Haven's trouble rarely was. A Terran family
in Sector Two found the word MURDERERS painted on their door in red — not
because they had murdered anyone, but because they were Terran, and Terrans
had destroyed Prometheus. A Callistoan woman was refused service at the
equipment depot by a Terran clerk who said, with the flat insolence of
petty authority, that the inventory system was down and she should come
back tomorrow. The inventory system was not down. The clerk simply did not
wish to hand tools to a Callistoan. A Terran boy and a Callistoan boy,
both eleven years old, fought in the school yard, not over ideology but
over a ball, and the fight escalated because every fight between a Terran
child and a Callistoan child was never about the ball.

Ruth dealt with each incident through the established protocols: warnings,
mediation sessions, reassignment of the depot clerk. The protocols worked,
in the sense that they prevented escalation. They did not work in the sense
that they solved anything. You could not solve grief with a protocol. You
could not solve rage with a reassignment.

On the seventh day, Lena Vasik appeared at Ruth's office.

"I need to talk to you," Lena said. She was holding Piotr on her hip, and
the baby was sleeping, his face pressed against his mother's shoulder with
the absolute trust of a creature who has not yet learned that the universe
is unsafe.

"Sit down," Ruth said.

Lena sat. "The housing in Sector Four is adequate. The food is adequate.
The medical care is good — better than we had at Prometheus. I want you to
know that I am grateful."

"But," Ruth said.

"But we are being kept separate. Your Terran residents and my Callistoan
group — we eat at different times, we work different shifts, we occupy
different sectors. This is not coexistence. This is parallel existence.
Two populations sharing a planet the way two strangers share a bus."

"It prevents conflict."

"It defers conflict. It does not prevent it. Conflict is prevented by
contact, not by separation."

"Contact produces conflict," Ruth said. "I see it every day."

"Contact produces friction," Lena said. "Friction is not the same as
conflict. Friction is what happens when two surfaces touch. It generates
heat, and heat is uncomfortable, but it also generates familiarity, and
familiarity is the only known antidote to the dehumanization that makes
war possible."

Ruth looked at this woman — this Callistoan woman, whose government had
ordered the strike that killed Amara, whose people had celebrated the
bombardment of Dione as a military victory, who sat in Ruth's office with
her sleeping baby and her structural engineer's precision and spoke about
friction and familiarity as if peace were a materials science problem.

"My sister died at Dione," Ruth said.

"I know," Lena said. "My husband died at Prometheus. I am not asking you to
forgive the people who killed your sister. I am not capable of forgiving the
people who killed my husband. Forgiveness may come in time, or it may not.
I am asking for something smaller and harder than forgiveness. I am asking
for proximity."

                               IV.

Ruth took the proposal to Caron.

"She wants mixed housing," Ruth said. "Terran and Callistoan families in the
same sectors. Mixed shifts at the workshops. Children in the same class
groups, not separated by origin."

Caron considered this with the particular stillness that Ruth had come to
recognize as her processing mode — the brief, concentrated silence of a
mind running calculations.

"The risk is increased friction," Caron said.

"She says friction is the point."

"What do you say?"

Ruth did not answer immediately. She thought about the bus analogy —
two strangers sharing a ride, carefully not looking at each other, each
pretending the other did not exist. She thought about what happened when
the bus broke down, when the strangers were forced to stand on the side of
the road together and wait for help. Sometimes they fought. Sometimes they
talked. Sometimes the talking led to something that was not friendship and
not forgiveness but was, in its awkward, uncomfortable, pragmatic way,
a beginning.

"I say we try it," Ruth said. "We monitor carefully. We intervene at the
first sign of violence. But we try it."

Caron nodded. "Draw up the plan."

Ruth drew up the plan. It was not complicated. She reassigned housing to
create mixed sectors. She restructured the work shifts so that Terran and
Callistoan workers shared the same rotations. She redesigned the school
schedule so that children attended classes together. She did all of this
with the meticulous attention to logistics that was her particular gift,
and she did it without optimism, because optimism was not required. What
was required was plumbing.

The first week was terrible. The second week was worse. The third week
produced a fistfight in the dining hall between a Terran man who had lost
his son at the battle of Titan and a Callistoan man who had served on the
ship that fought at Titan, and Ruth had to separate them physically, taking
an elbow to the jaw in the process, and she stood between them with blood
on her lip and said, "You are both going to detention, and when you come
out, you are both going to eat in the same dining hall, and you are going
to do this every day until one of you dies of old age, because that is
what peace costs, and if you are not willing to pay it, you are welcome to
leave Haven and return to the war."

Neither man left. They ate in the same dining hall. They did not speak to
each other. This was sufficient. Peace did not require speech. Peace
required presence.

The fourth week produced something worse than a fistfight. A Terran woman
named Ilse Brandt, who had lost both parents in the orbital bombardment of
Europa, left a handwritten note under the door of every Callistoan
residence in Sector Three. The note listed the names of the dead at Europa
— all four hundred and seventeen of them — and ended with a single
sentence: "These are the people your government killed. Read their names.
Learn them. Carry them."

The Callistoan residents read the notes. Some were angry. Some were
ashamed. One — an elderly man named Petrov, who had been a schoolteacher
on Callisto — came to Ruth's office with the note in his hand and his eyes
red and said, "I read every name. I will carry them. But I also carry the
names of the dead at Prometheus, and the dead at Ganymede, and the dead at
my nephew's school, which your alliance destroyed in a strike that was
supposed to hit a munitions depot. Does she carry those names too?"

Ruth did not know. She did not ask Ilse. She filed the incident, issued a
warning about unauthorized distribution of materials, and went back to work.
She understood that the notes were not harassment. They were grief, and
grief required an audience, and the only audience that mattered was the
people whose government had caused the grief, because they were the only
people who could receive the weight of it without being able to set it
down.

This was the thing about proximity that Lena Vasik had understood and that
Ruth was only now beginning to grasp: proximity did not produce comfort.
It produced confrontation. The confrontation was painful and necessary
and looked nothing like the reconciliation scenes in films, where enemies
shook hands and music played and the audience felt reassured that
human nature was fundamentally good. Human nature was fundamentally
complicated, and the complication was the material from which peace had
to be built, not despite the pain but through it.

                               V.

The months passed. The friction continued, and the friction changed.

A Terran woman named Margaret, who had lost her husband at the siege of
Enceladus, began teaching a cooking class in the community hall, using the
limited ingredients available on Haven to produce meals that were, she
insisted, edible. A Callistoan man named Dmitri, who had been a chef on
Prometheus, attended the class and contributed recipes from the Callistoan
culinary tradition, which favored fermented vegetables and smoked proteins.
They argued about seasoning with a passion that, to an outside observer,
would have been indistinguishable from friendship.

A Terran girl named Sophie and a Callistoan girl named Anya, both nine years
old, discovered that they shared an obsession with the mathematics of
orbital mechanics and began spending their afternoons in the settlement
library, working through problems on a shared tablet. Their parents
tolerated this with varying degrees of discomfort. The girls did not notice
the discomfort. They were too busy calculating transfer orbits.

A Callistoan doctor named Yuri began holding joint medical clinics with the
Terran physician, Dr. Hasegawa, and their collaboration produced a
treatment protocol for the respiratory infections that plagued the
settlement — a protocol that neither could have developed alone, because it
combined Callistoan pharmaceutical knowledge with Terran diagnostic
techniques, and neither tradition was sufficient by itself.

Ruth watched all of this with the wary attention of an engineer monitoring
a load-bearing structure under stress. She did not call it progress. She
called it function. The settlement was functioning — not harmoniously, not
beautifully, but functionally, the way a machine functions when its parts
are properly arranged and adequately maintained. People who had every reason
to hate each other were sharing water and food and medical care and living
space, and they were doing this not because they had been healed or
reconciled or redeemed but because the alternative was to return to the war,
and the war had taken everything they had, and they were unwilling to give
it anything more.

The war itself continued. News reached Haven through the communications
relay — delayed, filtered, stripped of propaganda by the settlement's
neutral staff, but still recognizable as the voice of catastrophe. A
battle at the Jupiter LaGrange points. A bombardment of a civilian station
in the Belt. A ceasefire proposed and rejected and proposed again with
different terms and rejected again. The war had its own momentum, its own
logic, its own self-sustaining cycle of retaliation and counter-retaliation,
and it would not end because people on Haven were learning to share a dining
hall. But the people on Haven were learning to share a dining hall, and this
fact — small, local, without strategic significance — mattered to Ruth in a
way that the grand machinery of war did not, because it was real. It was
happening. It was not a policy or a negotiating position or a principle
articulated from the safety of a capital city. It was Margaret teaching
Dmitri to make bread from hydroponic wheat, and Dmitri teaching Margaret to
ferment vegetables in the Callistoan tradition, and neither of them
pretending that the sharing of recipes was the same as the resolution of
grief, but doing it anyway, because it was what they could do, and what
they could do was enough.

Ruth began to notice something else: the children. Not the fights — the
fights were expected, monitored, managed — but the other thing, the thing
that happened when children who were too young to have fought in the war
spent time together without adult supervision. They played. They invented
games that combined Terran and Callistoan rules in ways that made no sense
to either tradition and perfect sense to the children. They formed
friendships with the casual, unselfconscious ease of creatures who had not
yet learned that the other children were supposed to be enemies. A Terran
boy named James and a Callistoan boy named Alexei, both seven, became
inseparable, communicating in a pidgin of English and Callistoan Russian
that their parents could barely follow and that the boys found hilarious.
Ruth watched them playing in the settlement yard one afternoon and thought:
This is what it looks like before the hatred has been taught.

On a Thursday evening, seven months after the Callistoan refugees arrived,
Ruth sat in the dining hall eating a meal that Margaret and Dmitri had
prepared together — a stew of hydroponic vegetables in a fermented broth
that was, against all probability, delicious — and she looked across the
hall and saw Lena Vasik sitting at a table with two Terran women and a
Callistoan couple. Piotr was on Lena's lap, eating mashed vegetables with
his hands. One of the Terran women was making faces at the baby, and Piotr
was laughing.

Ruth watched this small scene — a baby laughing in a dining hall on a
marginal planet at the edge of a war zone — and she felt something shift in
her chest. Not forgiveness. She was not yet capable of forgiveness, and she
did not know if she ever would be. What she felt was something smaller and
harder and more durable than forgiveness. She felt the willingness to be in
the same room. She felt proximity.

She finished her meal and walked back to her office and sat at her desk and
looked at the settlement plan — the housing assignments, the work schedules,
the careful logistics of coexistence — and she thought: This is what peace
looks like. Not a treaty. Not a ceremony. Not the clasped hands and solemn
faces of politicians. This. A baby laughing. A stew. Two people who have
every reason to hate each other arguing about whether the broth needs more
salt.

She picked up her pen and began planning the next quarter's housing
assignments. There was work to do. There was always work to do. The plumbing
of peace required constant maintenance, and Ruth Okafor was good at
maintenance, and that, for now, was enough.

================================================================================

                      THE GREENHOUSE DIRECTIVE

                        by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                               I.

The equator had been abandoned for six years when Miriam Goss proposed
seeding the atmosphere with living things.

She sat in the conference room at the Reykjavik Climate Authority, a
converted warehouse on the harbor that still smelled faintly of fish, and
projected her charts onto the wall. Outside, the rain fell in the steady,
grey, relentless curtain that characterized Icelandic autumn and that had,
in recent years, become Icelandic summer and Icelandic spring as well, the
seasons blurring into a single wet, mild, undifferentiated murk as the
global temperature continued its upward climb.

"The equatorial belt is now uninhabitable," she said. This was not news.
Everyone in the room knew it. A band of territory extending roughly fifteen
degrees north and south of the equator — comprising portions of Central
America, northern South America, Central Africa, the Indian subcontinent,
and Southeast Asia — had crossed the threshold of sustained wet-bulb
temperature that the human body could not survive without continuous
mechanical cooling. The cities had been evacuated. The farms had been
abandoned. The forests were dying. Two billion people had relocated northward
or southward, and the refugee crisis had redefined the politics of every
nation on Earth.

"Current models project continued expansion of the uninhabitable zone at a
rate of approximately one degree of latitude per decade," Miriam continued.
"By 2090, the zone will extend to the thirtieth parallel. By 2120, if the
feedback loops continue unchecked, it will reach the fortieth. At that
point, the habitable surface of the Earth will be confined to the polar
regions, and the carrying capacity of those regions will support a global
population of approximately eight hundred million."

She paused. The number hung in the room like a held breath. There were
currently nine billion people alive. Eight hundred million was the number
that remained after subtraction, and the subtraction was the thing no one
in the room wanted to discuss, because the subtraction was not an
abstraction. It was a forecast of death on a scale that the human mind was
not equipped to process.

Miriam knew the number was not abstract. She had grown up on a wheat farm
in central Kansas, and the farm was gone. Not abandoned — Kansas was still
habitable, still within the temperate zone — but the wheat was failing. The
rainfall patterns had shifted. The aquifer beneath the farm, which her
grandfather had tapped in 1952, was depleted. Her parents had sold the land
in 2058 and moved to a small apartment in Wichita, where her father spent
his days watching weather forecasts with the intensity of a man who no
longer had crops to protect but could not break the habit of watching the
sky. He died in 2063, and Miriam sometimes thought that the loss of the
farm had killed him more surely than the cancer that was named on the death
certificate.

She carried the farm with her the way a refugee carries the memory of home:
not as nostalgia but as orientation, as a fixed point from which all
distances could be measured. The equator's death was the farm's death writ
large — the same process, the same cause, the same failure of stewardship,
scaled from a single family's loss to a planetary catastrophe. She was not
sentimental about this. She was precise. The precision was the sentiment.

"Carbon reduction is necessary but insufficient," Miriam said. "We could
achieve zero emissions tomorrow — which we cannot, but hypothetically — and
the thermal inertia of the system would continue driving temperatures
upward for another sixty to eighty years. The carbon already in the
atmosphere is a commitment. We cannot uncommit. What we can do is intervene
in the energy balance directly."

She brought up the next chart. It showed a schematic of the upper
atmosphere, the stratosphere, the region between ten and fifty kilometers
above the surface where the physics of radiative transfer determined how
much of the sun's energy reached the ground.

"Stratospheric aerosol injection has been proposed and rejected multiple
times," she said. "The risks are well documented: disruption of monsoon
patterns, ozone depletion, acid deposition, and the termination problem —
if injection ceases, the masked warming returns within a decade. I am not
proposing aerosol injection."

She paused again. "I am proposing something that has not been proposed
before. I am proposing that we seed the upper atmosphere with engineered
organisms — specifically, a modified strain of cyanobacteria designed to
inhabit the stratosphere and reflect a calculated portion of incoming solar
radiation."

The room went very still.

"Living organisms," said Dr. Henrik Sandberg, the Authority's chief
climate modeler, who was sitting across the table with his arms folded and
his expression arranged into the particular configuration of skepticism
that climate scientists reserve for ideas they find simultaneously
brilliant and terrifying.

"Living organisms," Miriam confirmed. "Engineered to be autotrophic,
radiation-resistant, and self-sustaining at stratospheric altitude. They
would form a thin, reflective biofilm in the upper atmosphere — a living
sunshade, effectively. The organisms would reproduce at a controlled rate,
maintaining the biofilm without ongoing human intervention. The reflective
effect would reduce incoming solar radiation by approximately two percent,
which our models project would be sufficient to halt and gradually reverse
the expansion of the uninhabitable zone."

"And if they don't stay controlled?" Sandberg asked.

Miriam clicked to the next chart. "The organisms are engineered with
multiple fail-safes. Temperature-dependent growth inhibition: below minus
sixty Celsius, reproduction ceases. Nutrient limitation: the organisms
require trace concentrations of phosphorus, which are naturally limited at
stratospheric altitude, capping population density. And a genetic kill
switch: a synthetic dependency on a specific amino acid that does not occur
in the natural environment, requiring periodic supplementation from
ground-based release to maintain viability."

"How periodic?"

"Annual."

"And if we miss a year?"

"The population crashes. The biofilm dissipates within six to eight months.
The warming returns."

Sandberg unfolded his arms. "So we'd be committing to an indefinite program
of atmospheric maintenance."

"Yes," Miriam said. "But we are already committed to an indefinite program
of atmospheric consequences. The question is not whether we manage the
atmosphere. We have been managing it, badly, for two centuries. The question
is whether we manage it deliberately."

                               II.

The debate lasted fourteen months.

It was conducted in conference rooms and legislative chambers and newspaper
editorials and university lecture halls and, most fiercely, in the kitchens
and living rooms of ordinary people who understood, with the practical
intelligence of those who live close to the weather, that the decision
would determine whether their grandchildren had a world to live in.

The objections were serious and sincere. The environmental organizations
opposed the plan on the grounds that it represented an unprecedented
intervention in a planetary system that humanity did not fully understand.
The religious communities objected to the creation of organisms designed to
inhabit a domain — the sky — that many traditions regarded as sacred. The
political objections were more varied: the nations that would benefit most
from cooling were not the same nations that would bear the risks, and the
nations that bore the risks did not trust the nations that would benefit
to maintain the annual supplementation program. Everyone remembered the
carbon treaties that had been signed and broken, signed and broken, signed
and broken, until the word "treaty" itself had become a synonym for
institutional failure.

There were also the personal objections — the ones that did not appear in
position papers or legislative testimony but that Miriam heard in the
corridors and the cafeterias and the late-night conversations that followed
the formal sessions. A fisherman from the Maldives, relocated to Denmark,
who said: "You are asking me to trust the same institutions that promised
to keep my islands above water and failed." A farmer from Bangladesh, now
living in a camp in Sweden, who said: "My family has farmed the same land
for four hundred years. The land is gone. My village is gone. And you want
to put bacteria in the sky? What makes you think the sky will not betray us
too?" A grandmother from Senegal, caring for orphaned grandchildren in a
resettlement block in Glasgow, who said nothing at all but whose silence
carried the weight of everything that had already been lost.

Miriam heard these objections and respected them and did not dismiss them.
She had grown up on a farm. She understood weather. She understood the
relationship between human beings and the sky — the way a farmer reads the
clouds, the way a fisherman reads the wind, the way every creature that
lives beneath the atmosphere depends on its stability and is betrayed by
its change. She understood that what she was proposing was not merely a
technical intervention but a transformation in humanity's relationship with
its own sky — from passive recipient to active manager, from creature to
gardener, from tenant to custodian.

Miriam participated in the debate with the patient determination of a woman
who had spent her career studying systems and understood that the most
important variable in any system was time. The equatorial zone was expanding.
Every year of delay was another degree of latitude lost. The arithmetic
was merciless, and Miriam had the particular advantage of a scientist who
could do the arithmetic in public, clearly and without euphemism.

She testified before the United Nations General Assembly in a session that
was broadcast globally. She wore a plain grey suit and spoke for ninety
minutes without notes, presenting the data with the calm precision of a
farmer explaining the weather: these are the facts, this is what they mean,
this is what we can do. When a delegate from Brazil asked her whether she
was certain the organisms would behave as predicted, she said, "No. I am
certain of two things: the organisms might fail, and the current trajectory
will fail. The difference is that the organisms represent a chance. The
current trajectory represents a certainty."

The vote passed. Not unanimously — the objections did not evaporate, and
the nations that voted no had reasons that Miriam respected even as she
disagreed with them — but with sufficient majority to authorize the program.
The Greenhouse Directive, as it was formally known, was signed in Reykjavik
on a grey afternoon in October, and Miriam stood at the harbor and watched
the rain fall and felt not triumph but the particular, exhausted relief of
a person who has been arguing for the obvious and has finally been heard.

                               III.

The seeding began in March.

High-altitude aircraft released the engineered cyanobacteria at eleven
sites distributed around the globe, concentrating on the latitudes where
solar radiation was most intense. The organisms had been cultivated in
sealed bioreactors for two years, their behavior observed and documented
with the meticulous thoroughness that the program's critics had demanded
and that Miriam had welcomed, because thoroughness was not the enemy of
action — it was the precondition for responsible action.

The organisms performed as designed. Within six months, atmospheric
monitoring stations detected a measurable increase in stratospheric albedo
— a slight brightening of the upper atmosphere, invisible to the naked eye
but detectable by satellite instrumentation. Within a year, global mean
temperature had declined by 0.3 degrees Celsius. Within two years, the
decline had reached 0.7 degrees. The expansion of the uninhabitable zone
slowed, stopped, and began, tentatively, to reverse.

The world exhaled.

Miriam did not exhale. She sat in her office at the Reykjavik Climate
Authority and studied the monitoring data with the anxious attention of a
farmer watching a newly planted field, and what she saw in the data worried
her.

The organisms were reproducing faster than the models had predicted.

The discrepancy was small — perhaps fifteen percent above the projected
rate — and it fell within the confidence interval of the original
estimates. But Miriam had spent her career studying biological systems,
and she knew that biological systems did not respect confidence intervals.
Confidence intervals were statistical constructs, abstractions that
described the range of expected behavior for a well-understood system. The
stratospheric cyanobacteria were not a well-understood system. They were a
new system — a novel organism in a novel environment — and new systems had
a tendency to surprise.

She flagged the discrepancy in her monthly report. The report was read by
thirty-seven people, acknowledged by twelve, and acted upon by none.

                               IV.

The organisms evolved.

This should not have been surprising. All living things evolve. It is what
they do. The engineered cyanobacteria had been designed with multiple
safeguards against evolutionary drift — the genetic kill switch, the
temperature-dependent growth inhibitor, the nutrient limitation — but
evolution is patient and resourceful and does not read design specifications.

The first sign was the nutrient limitation failure. The organisms had been
engineered to require trace concentrations of atmospheric phosphorus, which
was naturally scarce at stratospheric altitude. But a subpopulation of the
organisms — a mutant strain that appeared approximately eighteen months
after seeding — developed the ability to fix nitrogen directly from the
atmosphere and to synthesize phosphorus from sulfur compounds present in
volcanic aerosols. This subpopulation was no longer nutrient-limited. It
reproduced freely.

Miriam identified the mutation from atmospheric samples collected by a
monitoring aircraft and recognized immediately what it meant. She walked
into Henrik Sandberg's office without knocking.

"We have a problem," she said.

Sandberg looked at the data. He was quiet for a long time. "How fast is
the mutant strain spreading?"

"It's already dominant. The original strain can't compete. The mutant has
a reproductive advantage of approximately forty percent."

"And the growth inhibitor?"

"Still functional. Below minus sixty, reproduction stops. But that's the
only remaining constraint. The nutrient cap is gone. The kill switch—" She
paused. "I'm testing the kill switch. I need another week."

The kill switch had failed. Not dramatically — not the sudden, catastrophic
failure of a dam breaking — but incrementally, the way biological systems
fail: a point mutation in the synthetic dependency gene, propagated through
the population by the relentless pressure of natural selection, which
favored organisms that did not require an artificial amino acid for survival
over organisms that did. The mutant strain was fully independent. It did not
need the annual supplementation. It would not crash if the supplementation
ceased. It was, in the precise and terrifying terminology of ecology,
established.

"We need to stop the seeding," Miriam said. "Immediately."

"The seeding stopped a year ago," Sandberg reminded her. "The organisms are
self-sustaining. That was the design."

"The design was for a controlled population. This is not controlled."

"What do you recommend?"

Miriam looked out the window at the Reykjavik harbor, where the rain had
stopped for the first time in weeks. The sky was lightening. She realized
that the sky had been lightening for months — not in the way of weather
clearing, but in the way of the atmosphere itself changing, becoming
brighter, more reflective, as the unconstrained biofilm spread and
thickened and did what living things do when freed from constraint: it
grew.

"I recommend that we prepare for the possibility that we have solved one
problem and created another," she said.

                               V.

The cooling accelerated.

In the third year after seeding, global mean temperature declined by an
additional 1.2 degrees Celsius — nearly double the intended rate. The
equatorial zone, which had been slowly becoming habitable again, continued
to cool, but now the temperate zones were cooling too. Snow fell in July
in London. The growing season in the American Midwest shortened by three
weeks. Crop yields in northern Europe declined by twelve percent.

The biofilm was visible now. On clear days, if you looked straight up, the
sky was not quite the right shade of blue. It was paler, milkier, as if
someone had added a few drops of cream to the atmosphere. The sun felt
different — still warm, but diffused, its light scattered through the
living layer overhead so that shadows were softer and the quality of
illumination had the flat, even character of an overcast day even when
there were no clouds.

The people who had been rescued from the equatorial heat now found
themselves confronting a different threat. The refugees who had relocated to
northern Europe and Canada had planted gardens and started farms and begun
the slow, patient work of building new lives in new climates. Now the
climate was changing again, the growing seasons shrinking, the winters
lengthening, and the refugees — who had already lost one homeland to heat —
watched the thermometer fall with the particular dread of people who have
learned that the Earth is not a stable platform but a restless, changeable,
indifferent system that does not arrange itself for human convenience.

Miriam received letters. Hundreds of them, then thousands. Some were
grateful — thank you for the cooling, thank you for making the equator
habitable again, thank you for saving us. Some were angry — what have you
done to the weather, why is it snowing in June, my crops are failing and
my children are cold. Some were resigned, written in the flat, exhausted
prose of people who had survived too many changes to be surprised by
another: "First it was too hot. Now it is getting too cold. We will adapt.
We always adapt. But we are tired of adapting."

Miriam read every letter. She did not respond to most of them, because
there was nothing she could say that would be adequate, and inadequate
responses were worse than silence. But she kept them in a drawer in her
desk, a growing archive of human response to a planetary system that she
had altered and that was now altering itself, independent of her intentions,
indifferent to her designs.

Miriam's team modeled the trajectory. The results were unambiguous. If the
biofilm continued to expand at its current rate — and there was no reason
to believe it would stop, because the mutant strain had no effective
constraint — global mean temperature would decline by six to eight degrees
within twenty years. This would erase the warming of the past two centuries
and then continue downward, pushing the climate toward conditions not seen
since the Little Ice Age or beyond. Glacial advance. Sea ice expansion.
The collapse of agriculture in the northern latitudes. A different
catastrophe, arriving from the opposite direction with the same merciless
arithmetic.

"We traded fire for ice," Sandberg said, looking at the projections.

"Not yet," Miriam said. "The models show a twenty-year timeline. We have
time to intervene."

"How?"

This was the question that Miriam had been working on for six months, and
the answer was unsatisfying in the way that all honest answers to complex
problems are unsatisfying: it was partial, uncertain, and dependent on
variables that could not be fully controlled.

"We introduce a predator," she said. "A second engineered organism —
a bacteriophage, specifically — designed to target the mutant strain and
reduce its population to a level consistent with the original design
parameters."

Sandberg stared at her. "You want to release another engineered organism
into the stratosphere to control the first one that got out of control."

"Yes."

"And if the second organism also evolves? If it also exceeds its design
parameters?"

"Then we adapt. We monitor, we model, we intervene. We manage the system."

"Forever?"

"Yes," Miriam said. "Forever. That is the consequence of what we've done.
We have created a living system in the atmosphere, and living systems
require management. The alternative is to do nothing and accept either the
ice or the fire, and I am not willing to accept either."

                               VI.

The bacteriophage was released eight months later, from the same
high-altitude aircraft, at the same eleven sites. It was engineered with
the lessons of the first failure incorporated: multiple redundant
constraints, a genetic architecture designed to resist evolutionary drift,
and a monitoring system that sampled the stratospheric population weekly
and reported any deviation from expected behavior.

Miriam watched the data with the attention of a woman who understood that
she was now responsible for the weather. Not responsible in the abstract
way that all of humanity was responsible for the warming — the diffuse,
collective, deniable responsibility of a civilization that had burned
carbon for two centuries and hoped for the best. Responsible in the
specific, personal, undeniable way of a farmer who has planted a crop and
must tend it: watering, weeding, watching for blight, adjusting to the
weather that the crop itself was creating.

The bacteriophage worked. Within six months, the mutant cyanobacteria
population began to decline. The biofilm thinned. The sky returned to
something closer to its proper blue. Global mean temperature stabilized.
The cooling decelerated.

But the system was different now. It was not the atmosphere as it had been
before human intervention — that atmosphere was gone, as irretrievably as
the dodo or the passenger pigeon. It was a managed atmosphere, a cultivated
sky, a garden of invisible organisms that required continuous tending. The
cyanobacteria and the bacteriophage coexisted in a dynamic equilibrium
that was stable only as long as someone was watching, someone was measuring,
someone was adjusting the balance when it drifted.

The equatorial belt began to recover. Slowly — the speed of ecological
recovery bore no relation to the speed of ecological destruction, a
disparity that Miriam found both unjust and instructive — the temperatures
in the abandoned zone declined to survivable levels. The first tentative
expeditions returned to the equatorial cities and found them overgrown,
reclaimed by vegetation that had adapted to the heat and was now reluctant
to yield to returning human habitation. Jakarta was a jungle. Kinshasa was
a forest. The streets of Chennai were rivers of green, the buildings draped
in vines that had climbed forty stories in six years and showed no
inclination to descend.

The recovery would take decades. The refugees would not return quickly or
easily, and the cities they returned to would not be the cities they had
left. This was the lesson that Miriam carried from her Kansas childhood:
the land changes, and the land's change changes the people, and the
people's change changes the land, and the cycle has no endpoint and no
resting state. There was no "normal" to return to. There was only the
next configuration, and the next, and the next, each one requiring new
attention, new understanding, new adjustment.

She thought sometimes about the critics who had said that the Greenhouse
Directive was humanity playing God. They were right, in a sense — humanity
was intervening in a planetary system with the deliberate intention of
altering its behavior. But they were wrong about the nature of the
intervention. Playing God implied omniscience, implied control, implied a
designer who understood the full implications of the design. What Miriam
had done was closer to playing gardener: intervening in a system she
partially understood, accepting that the intervention would have
consequences she could not fully predict, and committing to the ongoing
work of responding to those consequences as they arose. It was not
godlike. It was humble, uncertain, and necessary. It was farming.

Miriam understood that this was the world she had made. Not a fixed world,
not a solved world, not a world returned to some pristine pre-industrial
condition that existed more in nostalgia than in fact. A tended world. A
world that required the same attention from humanity that a garden requires
from a gardener: constant, vigilant, humble, and without end.

She stood at the window of her office in Reykjavik and looked at the sky.
It was blue. Not the blue it had been — she would never know whether it
was the same blue, because the instruments could not measure what the
eye remembered — but blue, and clear, and full of living things that no
one could see and everyone depended on.

She thought about the farm in Kansas where she had grown up, where her
father had risen every morning at five to check the wheat, to study the
sky, to make the hundred small decisions that determined whether the crop
lived or died. He had done this every day of his working life, and he had
never called it heroic, and it was not heroic. It was farming. It was the
patient, unglamorous, essential work of tending a living system that would
die without attention.

The atmosphere was the crop now. The Earth was the farm. And the work — the
endless, necessary, imperfect work of keeping a living system in balance —
was the inheritance she was leaving to every generation that followed.

She picked up the morning's monitoring report and began to read.

Outside, the rain had stopped. The sun came through the clouds, diffused
and gentle, its light filtered through a living sky.

                      THE TRANSLATOR'S PARADOX

                        by Sanjay Mukherjee

================================================================================

                               I.

The text arrived in a sealed container made of a material that Dr. Priya
Ramanathan could not identify, which was itself a datum of considerable
significance, because Priya had spent nineteen years studying the material
culture of the Vashkari and had catalogued every substance their
civilization employed, from the bioluminescent resins of their architecture
to the crystalline matrices of their computational systems. The container
was new. It was made of something she had never seen. This meant either
that the Vashkari had been withholding information — possible but
inconsistent with their observed cultural norms — or that the container had
been made specifically for this occasion, from a material reserved for a
purpose she did not yet understand.

She was sitting in her field office at the human research station on
Vashkar, a modest prefabricated structure that she had occupied for six
years and that she had gradually, unconsciously, decorated in a manner that
blended human and Vashkari aesthetics: her desk was covered with both
printed papers and Vashkari glyph-tablets, her walls displayed both family
photographs and pressed specimens of Vashkari textile flora, and the tea
she was drinking was brewed from a Vashkari herb that tasted, she had
decided, like cardamom arguing with eucalyptus.

She had been on Vashkar for six years — long enough to dream in Vashkari,
long enough to miss the chemical syntax when she returned to the sterile,
scent-neutral corridors of the human station. She had come as a researcher:
the first anthropologist on a world whose culture was, by every preliminary
assessment, among the most complex the Contact Bureau had encountered. The
Vashkari had literature, music, architecture, philosophy, law, and religion,
all of it organized around principles that bore no resemblance to human
cultural categories and that required years of immersion to begin to
comprehend.

Her first year had been humbling. Her second year had been devastating. Her
third year had been the year she stopped trying to fit Vashkari culture
into human frameworks and started trying to understand it on its own terms,
which was the year her work began to be worthwhile. Her father, the
anthropologist, had written to her from Calcutta: "You are finally doing
fieldwork. Everything before was tourism." He was right, and she had
resented his being right, and the resentment was itself a form of
recognition.

The container had been delivered by Keth-tavan, the senior keeper of the
Vashkari Archive of Sacred Texts, a being of immense age and quiet dignity
who had served as Priya's primary informant for the past four years. The
Vashkari were humanoid in the broadest sense — bilateral, upright,
endothermic — but their physiology diverged significantly from the human
template: their sensory apparatus was dominated by chemical and tactile
perception rather than visual, and their communication system combined
vocalization with the release of complex signaling molecules, a
language that Priya could partially understand through years of training
and the assistance of a chemical analysis unit strapped to her left wrist.

"This is the Vash-Orai," Keth-tavan had said, placing the container on
Priya's desk with a care that suggested the object was not merely valuable
but alive. The signaling molecules that accompanied the words carried
overtones of solemnity, reverence, and something Priya's analyzer
translated as "risk" — though this was an imprecise rendering of a concept
that encompassed danger, opportunity, and the transformative potential of
liminal experience.

"The Vash-Orai," Priya repeated. She knew the name. It appeared in the
Vashkari cultural literature with the frequency and gravity of a concept
like "Torah" or "Quran" or "Vedas" in human traditions. The Vash-Orai was
the Vashkari sacred text — the foundational document of their spiritual
tradition, which was not a religion in any sense that mapped cleanly onto
human categories but was something closer to a practice, a discipline, a
way of engaging with the mystery of consciousness and its relationship to
the material world.

She had been trying to gain access to the Vash-Orai for four years.
Keth-tavan had refused her requests with consistent gentleness, explaining
that the text was not hidden but "not yet ready to be encountered by one
who reads as you read." Priya had not understood this explanation and had
filed it, provisionally, under "cultural prohibitions requiring further
investigation." She had not expected to receive the text today. She had not
expected to receive it at all.

"Why now?" she asked.

Keth-tavan's signaling molecules shifted to a configuration Priya
recognized as pedagogical patience — the chemical equivalent of a teacher
deciding how much to explain and how much to let the student discover.

"Because you have been among us long enough to have been changed by us,"
Keth-tavan said. "The text requires a reader who has been changed. An
unchanged reader cannot encounter the Vash-Orai. The text will not allow
it."

Priya noted the phrasing — the text will not allow it — and recognized it
as either a cultural metaphor or a literal statement, and she did not yet
know which.

                               II.

She opened the container alone, after Keth-tavan had departed.

Inside was the text.

It was inscribed on a series of thin, flexible sheets made from a material
that resembled pressed plant fiber — analogous to paper, though the fibers
were finer and the surface had a faint iridescence that shifted color in
the light. The script was standard Vashkari glyph notation, which Priya
could read with reasonable fluency after years of study, though her
comprehension of Vashkari literary and religious registers remained, she
knew, imperfect.

She began to read.

The opening passage was a cosmogony — an account of the origin of
consciousness, which the Vashkari understood not as an emergent property
of biological complexity but as a fundamental feature of the universe,
present in all matter and all energy, differing only in degree and
configuration. This was not unfamiliar territory. Priya had encountered
versions of this belief in her fieldwork, and it resonated with certain
strands of human philosophy — panpsychism, Advaita Vedanta, the animist
traditions of numerous indigenous cultures. She read the passage with
the careful, analytical attention of an anthropologist encountering a
primary text, noting the specific terminology, the structural parallels
with oral traditions she had recorded, the points of convergence and
divergence with the published accounts.

She read for two hours. The text was not long — perhaps thirty pages of
Vashkari script — but it was dense, layered, allusive, drawing on a
cultural context that Priya could access only partially, like a reader
encountering the Upanishads without knowledge of the Vedic tradition from
which they emerged. She took notes. She cross-referenced her existing
research. She drank two cups of the cardamom-eucalyptus tea.

When she finished, she returned to the beginning and began again.

The second reading was different.

The difference was not subtle. It was not the ordinary deepening of
understanding that accompanies rereading — the way a second encounter with
a complex text reveals nuances that the first reading missed. The text
itself was different. The glyphs on the page were the same glyphs she had
read two hours earlier — she checked, carefully, comparing her notes from
the first reading with what she now saw on the page — but the meaning they
conveyed had changed.

The cosmogony was still there, but its emphasis had shifted. The first
reading had presented consciousness as universal, distributed, a property
of all matter. The second reading presented consciousness as relational —
not a substance but an event, not a thing that matter possessed but an
interaction that occurred between matter and its observer. The universe was
not conscious in itself; it became conscious in the act of being perceived.
The perceiver did not discover consciousness; the perceiver created it, in
the same way that a reader created meaning from marks on a page.

Priya put the text down. She picked it up. She read the first page again.
The text had changed again.

She was a scientist. She did not panic. She ran the analysis.

She photographed each page of the text with her field camera, producing a
high-resolution image of every glyph. She then read the text a third time,
taking careful notes on its content. When she finished, she compared her
third-reading notes with the photographs.

The photographs showed the same glyphs. Her notes described a different
text.

The third reading presented consciousness not as universal or relational
but as generative — an active force that shaped the material world through
the act of attention. The universe was not a fixed structure perceived by
consciousness; it was a fluid, responsive medium that consciousness
sculpted through engagement. Perception was not passive reception; it was
creation.

Three readings. Three texts. The same physical object.

                               III.

She went to Keth-tavan.

The keeper of the Archive received her in the reading chamber, a circular
room with walls of bioluminescent resin that cast a steady, amber light.
Keth-tavan was seated on a raised platform at the center of the room,
surrounded by containers of various sizes and materials, each holding a
text. The room smelled of chemicals that Priya's analyzer decoded as calm,
attention, and welcome.

"The text changes," Priya said.

"Yes."

"Each time I read it, the meaning is different."

"Yes."

"The physical glyphs are the same. I have verified this with photography.
The marks on the page do not change. But the meaning changes."

"Yes."

"How?"

Keth-tavan released a complex molecule that Priya's analyzer required
several seconds to process. The translation, when it came, was: "The text
does not change. The reader changes. The meaning is created in the
encounter between text and reader, and since the reader is different with
each encounter — altered by the act of reading, by the passage of time,
by the accumulation of experience — the meaning is different with each
encounter."

Priya considered this. "That is true of all texts," she said. "Every reader
brings a different context to a text, and meaning is co-created by the
reader and the text. This is basic hermeneutics. But the difference with
the Vash-Orai is not a matter of interpretation. The text says different
things. Not subtly different. Fundamentally different."

"Yes."

"How is this possible?"

Keth-tavan was silent for a long time. The bioluminescent walls pulsed
gently, and Priya realized — not for the first time — that the architecture
of the reading chamber was itself a kind of text, a spatial composition
designed to produce a specific state of mind in its occupant. She was being
prepared for something. She was being put into a condition of receptivity.

"The Vash-Orai was composed over a period of twelve thousand years," Keth-
tavan said. "It was written by many hands, in many eras, and it was written
with a specific intention: to create a text that would be true in all times,
for all readers, in all states of consciousness. The composers understood
that truth is not a fixed quantity. Truth is a relationship — between the
knower and the known, between the reader and the text, between the mind and
the world. A text that expressed a single truth would be true only for
readers who shared the conditions under which that truth was composed. It
would be false for all others."

"So they created a text that expresses multiple truths."

"They created a text that expresses all truths. Or, more precisely, a text
that creates the conditions under which the reader's own truth becomes
visible. The Vash-Orai does not contain meaning. It generates meaning. The
meaning it generates is specific to the reader, to the moment of reading,
to the totality of the reader's experience and consciousness. No two
readings are the same because no two encounters between a reader and a text
are the same."

Priya's anthropological training was asserting itself, producing
hypotheses, frameworks, analytical categories. "Is it a technology?" she
asked. "A linguistic technology? Something in the glyph structure that
activates different neural pathways depending on the reader's cognitive
state?"

"You are asking how it works."

"Yes."

"That is a question about mechanism. The answer to how is complex and would
require many years of study. I can answer a different question, if you are
willing to hear it."

"What question?"

"The question of what it means — not what the text means, but what it means
that such a text can exist."

Priya waited.

"If a sacred text can say different things to different readers — if the
same words can carry different truths depending on who encounters them and
when — then the text is not the locus of meaning. The reader is. The text
is a mirror, and what the reader sees in the mirror is not the mirror
but the reader. The Vash-Orai teaches this not by stating it — a
statement is fixed, and what is fixed is dead — but by demonstrating it.
Each time you read, you encounter yourself. Each time you encounter
yourself, you are different. Therefore the text is different. Therefore
the truth is different. Therefore the truth is alive."

Priya left the reading chamber and walked back to the human station through
the Vashkari afternoon. The twin suns were low, and the shadows they cast
were doubled, overlapping in the manner that had disoriented her during her
first months on the planet and that she now found natural — a landscape of
doubled shadows, of overlapping illuminations, of light that came from
two directions simultaneously and created a world without the stark
division between brightness and darkness that characterized monocular
worlds like Earth.

She sat at her desk and attempted to write a preliminary report on the
Vash-Orai. She drafted three paragraphs, deleted them, drafted three more,
deleted those, and finally closed her notebook and sat in silence.

The problem was not one of translation. She could describe, in competent
academic prose, the physical properties of the text, the circumstances of
its delivery, the cultural context of the Vashkari sacred tradition, and
the reported phenomenon of meaning-variation across readings. She could
frame the phenomenon within established theoretical frameworks: reader-
response theory, hermeneutic phenomenology, the anthropology of sacred
objects, the neuroscience of perception and interpretation. She could
produce a paper that her colleagues would find interesting and that the
journals would publish and that would be cited by other anthropologists
studying other alien cultures on other worlds.

But the paper would be a lie. Not factually false — the facts would be
accurate — but fundamentally dishonest, because it would treat the
Vash-Orai as an object of study when the experience of reading it had been
an encounter, and encounters were not the same as studies, and the
difference was the difference between dissecting a flower and smelling it.
She could describe the anatomy. She could not convey the scent.

She decided to do both: to write the paper and to continue reading.

                               IV.

Priya spent the next year with the Vash-Orai.

She read it once a week, always on the same day, at the same hour, in
the same place — her field office, at the desk, with a cup of tea — to
control for as many variables as she could. She kept meticulous records:
the date, the time, her physical and emotional state, the content of the
reading as she understood it, and any observations about the process of
reading itself.

She read the Vash-Orai fifty-two times. She received fifty-two different
texts.

The cosmogonic framework shifted with each reading, but the shifts were
not random. They formed a pattern — or rather, they formed a relationship,
a dialogue between Priya and the text that evolved over time as she
evolved. The early readings were philosophical and abstract, addressing
questions of consciousness, perception, and reality. As the months passed,
the readings became more personal, more intimate, more specific to Priya's
own experience.

In her twenty-third reading, the text addressed the death of her father,
which had occurred when she was sixteen and which she had never fully
mourned. The text did not mention her father — the glyphs were the same
universal, abstract symbols they had always been — but the meaning that
emerged from the encounter was about loss, about the way the dead live
in the attention of the living, about the way grief is a form of
perception and perception is a form of creation and therefore grief creates
the dead anew with each act of remembrance. She wept at her desk, her
tears falling on the iridescent pages, and the text did not change and
the text changed everything.

In her thirty-first reading, the text addressed her work — not the specific
content of her research but the nature of the anthropological enterprise
itself. It asked, without asking, whether the act of studying another
culture was an act of understanding or an act of appropriation, whether the
observer could ever truly comprehend the observed or whether observation
was always, inevitably, a form of transformation that destroyed the thing
it sought to know. This was the fieldworker's paradox that every
anthropologist lived with, and the text did not resolve it — resolution
would have been a fixed answer, and fixed answers were what the Vash-Orai
refused — but it held the paradox in a way that made it bearable, even
beautiful: the impossibility of perfect understanding was not a failure
but a feature, a guarantee that the encounter between cultures would always
produce something new, something that neither culture possessed before
the encounter, something that existed only in the space between.

In her thirty-eighth reading, the text addressed her mother. Not the
biographical fact of her mother — the classically trained singer, the
woman who filled the Calcutta house with music — but the experience of
being her mother's daughter, of carrying within herself a voice that was
not her own but that had shaped her own, the way a riverbed shapes the
water that flows through it. The text spoke — without speaking, through
the encounter between glyph and reader, through the alchemy of attention —
about inheritance, about the way each generation receives the world not as
a blank slate but as a palimpsest, written over and over by the hands of
the dead, and about the way the act of reading itself was an act of
inheritance: receiving meaning from marks made by hands that might be
centuries gone, and making the meaning new with each reception.

She began to correspond with her colleague Dr. Ursula Le Guin, who was
herself engaged in work that straddled anthropology and fiction, and who
understood the particular vertigo of an observer who has been changed by
the thing she observes. Le Guin wrote: "The problem you describe is the
central problem of all ethnography, and perhaps of all knowledge: the
instrument of observation is itself a participant in the phenomenon. The
Vashkari seem to have built this insight into the structure of their most
sacred text. This is either very sophisticated or very obvious, depending
on your perspective. I suspect it is both."

In her forty-second reading, the text addressed silence — the silence
between words, the silence between thoughts, the silence that is not the
absence of meaning but its precondition, the empty space in which meaning
can arise. This reading left Priya sitting at her desk for an hour after
finishing, saying nothing, thinking nothing, simply occupying the silence
that the text had opened in her, and finding it sufficient.

In her forty-seventh reading, the text addressed love.

She did not record the content of this reading in her notes.

                               V.

At the end of the year, she sat with Keth-tavan in the reading chamber and
tried to explain what she had learned.

"I cannot translate this text," she said.

"No."

"Not because my Vashkari is insufficient. Not because the concepts are too
alien. But because translation fixes meaning, and the Vash-Orai refuses
to be fixed. Any translation I produce would be a single reading — my
reading, in my language, at a specific moment — and it would claim to
represent the text, and the claim would be false, because the text is not
any single reading. The text is the relationship between all possible
readings and all possible readers across all possible times, and that
relationship cannot be captured in any fixed form."

"Yes."

"So what do I tell my colleagues? What do I put in my report? They sent me
here to study your culture, and the most important artifact of your culture
is a text I cannot translate, cannot describe, cannot even read the same
way twice."

Keth-tavan released a molecule that Priya's analyzer translated as
"compassion tempered with amusement."

"You could tell them what the text taught you," Keth-tavan said.

"It taught me something different every time."

"Then tell them that."

Priya was quiet for a long time. The amber walls pulsed. She thought about
her father. She thought about the fifty-two readings and the fifty-two
truths and the way each truth had been true and the way no truth had been
the truth, and she thought about the word scripture, which came from the
Latin scriptura, meaning a thing that has been written, a thing fixed, a
thing that stays, and she realized that the Vash-Orai was the opposite of
scripture in this sense: it was a thing that refused to stay, that moved
with the reader, that was alive in the way that a conversation is alive,
changing with each exchange, producing meaning that neither speaker
intended and neither speaker owned.

"I will tell them this," she said finally. "I will tell them that the
Vashkari possess a text that teaches by refusing to be the same twice.
That it is a sacred object not because it contains truth but because it
generates truth, differently for each reader, differently at each encounter,
infinitely and without repetition. And I will tell them that I have read it
fifty-two times and understood it fifty-two ways and that I am certain of
only one thing: that the fifty-third reading will teach me something I do
not yet know."

Keth-tavan's signaling molecules shifted to a configuration Priya had never
encountered. Her analyzer processed the chemicals for a long time and then
produced a translation that she recognized as inadequate the moment she
read it but that was, she supposed, the best that a fixed rendering could
do:

"Now you understand."

Priya looked at the keeper of the Archive, at the bioluminescent walls,
at the sealed containers of texts that she would never read and that would
never be the same if she did, and she understood that the translation was
both wrong and right, that she both understood and did not understand, and
that this was the point — that understanding was not a destination but a
practice, not a state but a motion, not a noun but a verb, and that the
practice required a lifetime, and that a lifetime was enough.

She placed the Vash-Orai in its container and closed the lid. She would
read it again next week. It would say something new.

She walked out of the reading chamber into the Vashkari afternoon, where
the twin suns cast overlapping shadows and the air carried molecules of
meaning she was still learning to read, and she carried with her a text
she could not translate and an understanding she could not fix and a
certainty that the encounter — between reader and text, between human and
alien, between the known and the unknowable — was itself the scripture,
was itself the sacred thing, and that it would never be the same twice,
and that this was not a failure but a gift.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a professor of astrophysics at the California
Institute of Technology and one of the most distinguished contributors in
the history of this magazine. His work — from the celebrated "Perihelion"
to "The Quiet After Cascade" — represents the gold standard of
scientifically rigorous fiction. "The Heretic's Frequency" continues his
exploration of the philosophical implications of cosmological discovery,
this time turning his precise, clinical attention to the question of what
happens to human beings when the universe reveals something they cannot
bear. He lives in Pasadena with his wife, Anne Lindqvist, and reports
that the signal in the story is fictional but "the mathematics is not
entirely impossible, which is what keeps me up at night."

JULIAN ST. CROIX is a British writer whose ornate, psychologically
charged fiction has been both celebrated and debated since his debut in
these pages with "The Cartography of Absence" (Issue #53). A graduate of
King's College, Cambridge, and the author of the literary novel "The
Hourglass Garden," St. Croix brings to science fiction a modernist
sensibility and a painterly eye for the surreal. "The Flaying of Marsyas"
draws on Greek myth to explore questions of art, cultural relativism, and
the price of aesthetic failure — themes close to St. Croix's heart and
rendered here in his most accessible and most devastating mode. He lives
in London.

GUNNAR ERIKSSON is a Swedish writer whose austere, luminous fiction has
appeared in these pages since 1954, when "The Long Watch" — a story that
earned a fan letter from Ray Bradbury — announced him as one of the most
distinctive voices in the field. "The Last Signal," at approximately
eighteen hundred words, is the shortest story we have ever published. We
make no apology for its brevity. It says everything it needs to say. A
literary translator by profession, Eriksson writes in English while living
in Swedish, a bilingual existence that he compares to "living in two
parallel worlds." He lives in Stockholm with his wife, the painter Ingrid
Bergstrom.

THEODORE CAIN is, by volume and by consistency, the backbone of this
magazine. In nearly thirty years of contribution, he has written more
stories for "Tales" than any other author, ranging across every sub-genre
with a craftsman's versatility and a working writer's reliability.
"Sanctuary" is among his most timely and morally serious stories — a
study of what peace requires from people who have every reason to refuse
it. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife, Jean, and their
three children, and continues to write from his converted bedroom every
evening from eight to midnight, seven days a week.

AGNES WHITFIELD is a Kansas writer whose spare, luminous fiction explores
the human response to catastrophe with a plainspoken honesty that
conceals careful artistry. A former schoolteacher and the daughter of a
farming family, Whitfield draws on a lifetime of watching weather and
tending land to create fiction that is rooted in the specific textures of
the physical world. "The Greenhouse Directive" is her most technically
ambitious story, addressing the runaway consequences of ecological
intervention with the patient, unflinching attention that has
characterized her best work. She lives on a farm outside Salina, Kansas,
with her husband, Lloyd.

SANJAY MUKHERJEE is a cultural anthropologist at the University of
California, Berkeley, whose fiction brings the methods and insights of
anthropological fieldwork to science fiction with results of remarkable
depth and sophistication. Born in Calcutta and educated at Presidency
College and Berkeley, Mukherjee writes about alien cultures with the
meticulous, layered attention of a scholar who understands that culture
is the most complex technology any species produces. "The Translator's
Paradox" explores the nature of sacred texts and the limits of
translation — themes that resonate with Mukherjee's own experience as a
man who lives between languages and between worlds. He lives in Berkeley
with his wife, Mika Hayashi.

SIGNALS RECEIVED: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

================================================================================

Dear Editors,

I have been reading this magazine since 1953, and I want you to know that
the Hugo nomination is deserved. Not because every story you publish is a
masterpiece — they are not, and you know it, and the honesty to publish an
imperfect story that does something interesting is itself a form of
editorial courage — but because the magazine, taken as a whole, represents
something important: the conviction that science fiction can be both
rigorous and beautiful, both entertaining and serious, both popular and
literary, without apology and without compromise. That conviction, in a
field that too often asks writers to choose between thinking and feeling,
is worth a Hugo.

                              -- Daniel Weiss, Philadelphia, PA

Dear Mr. Sterling and Ms. Foxworth,

Koslov's "The Quiet After Cascade" in your last issue was the finest story
I have read in any magazine this year, and I include in that assessment the
literary magazines, which would do well to pay attention to what Dr. Koslov
is doing. His ability to render complex physics emotionally resonant is
unmatched, and the moral dilemma at the story's center — whether to transmit
knowledge that will cause panic — is as relevant to our current political
situation as anything in the Congressional Record.

However, I must register a mild objection to St. Croix's "The Architecture
of Dreaming" in the same issue. I read it three times and I am not certain
I understood it once. I admire ambition, but I also admire clarity, and I
do not think the two are incompatible. Perhaps Mr. St. Croix might consider,
in future stories, the possibility that a sentence need not contain six
subordinate clauses to be profound.

                              -- Dr. Margaret Hollis,
                                 Department of English,
                                 University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI

Editors' note: Dr. Hollis, we suspect Mr. St. Croix would reply that the
subordinate clauses are the profundity. We will let readers judge for
themselves with his contribution to the present issue. -- M.S. & D.F.

*

Dear Editors,

I am a sixteen-year-old girl from Topeka, Kansas, and I want to say that
Agnes Whitfield is the best writer you publish. I know this is a minority
opinion — everyone talks about Koslov and St. Croix — but Mrs. Whitfield
writes about people I recognize. She writes about Kansas, and about farming,
and about ordinary people doing difficult things, and she does it with a
respect that I do not always find in science fiction, which sometimes seems
to believe that the future belongs only to scientists and astronauts. The
future belongs to all of us, including the girls from Topeka, and Mrs.
Whitfield knows this.

Dear Editors,

Eriksson's "Midwinter Light" in your last issue made me cry, and I am a
forty-seven-year-old marine engineer who has not cried since 1951. I don't
know how he does it. The man writes about nothing happening in space and
somehow it's the most moving thing I've ever read. Is it the prose? Is it
the rhythm? Is it some Swedish witchcraft? Whatever it is, I want more.

Dear Editors,

Congratulations on the Hugo nomination. A question: is it true that your
next issue will contain a story by Mukherjee? I have been following his
work since "The Wedding on Centauri" and consider him one of the most
original voices in the field. His anthropological approach to alien cultures
is precisely the kind of serious, rigorous world-building that science
fiction needs more of. If he has a new story forthcoming, I will renew
my subscription immediately.

                              -- Professor Arthur Naidu,
                                 Department of Anthropology,

Editors' note: Professor Naidu, renew with confidence. -- M.S. & D.F.

THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW: BOOK REVIEWS

================================================================================

DUNE by Frank Herbert
(Chilton Books, 1965. $5.95.)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Herbert has produced, in this massive and endlessly inventive novel,
what may be the most ambitious work of science fiction published in this
decade. Set on the desert planet of Arrakis, where the most valuable
substance in the universe — the spice melange — is produced by giant
sandworms and fought over by feudal houses of galactic scope, "Dune" is at
once a political thriller, an ecological treatise, a religious parable, and
a coming-of-age story of mythic proportions. The world-building is
extraordinary: Herbert has imagined not merely a planet but an entire
ecosystem, an entire political economy, an entire theology, and he has
done so with a specificity and internal consistency that rivals the best
work of Tolkien. The prose is muscular and confident, the characters vivid,
and the plot — which involves betrayal, exile, guerrilla warfare, and
messianic transformation — moves with the relentless force of a sandstorm.

It is not a short book, and there are passages where Mr. Herbert's
ambition exceeds his pacing. But these are minor quibbles about a major
achievement. "Dune" is the kind of novel that redefines what science fiction
is capable of. Highest recommendation.

THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH by Philip K. Dick
(Doubleday, 1965. $3.95.)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Philip Dick continues his extraordinary exploration of the nature of reality
with a novel that is, even by his standards, deeply unsettling. In a future
where colonists on Mars escape their miserable existence through a drug
that allows them to inhabit a shared hallucination, the arrival of a new,
more powerful drug — brought from the outer solar system by the enigmatic
Palmer Eldritch — threatens to dissolve the boundary between reality and
illusion altogether. Dick writes with a paranoid intensity that makes the
reader feel the walls of consensus reality crumbling, and the theological
implications of Eldritch's drug — which may or may not be a form of
communion with an alien god — are explored with a seriousness that belies
the novel's pulp packaging. This is not comfortable reading, but it is
essential reading, and I suspect it will be discussed for decades.

THE CRYSTAL WORLD by J.G. Ballard
(Jonathan Cape, 1966. 21s.)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Ballard's latest novel — the last in his sequence of disaster novels —
imagines a world in which matter is crystallizing, forests turning to
jeweled glass, rivers freezing into prisms of light. The setting is the
African jungle, and the prose matches the landscape in its lush, fever-
dream intensity. Ballard is not interested in the mechanics of catastrophe
but in its aesthetics: the crystallizing world is terrifying and beautiful
in equal measure, and the novel's protagonist is drawn toward it with a
fascination that mirrors the reader's own. This is New Wave science fiction
at its most accomplished — literary, visually stunning, and concerned with
the inner landscape of the human response to the alien. A remarkable novel,
and a fitting conclusion to an extraordinary series.

COMING ATTRACTIONS

================================================================================

In Issue #63 of Tales from the Future and Beyond (May 1966):

Dr. Vincent Koslov returns with a story of deep space observation that
pushes his spare, precise prose into new emotional territory. Dolores Reyes
makes her second appearance with a border story set between two alien
civilizations. Harold "Hal" Mercer dusts off his slide rule for a tale of
orbital construction under impossible constraints. And Gunnar Eriksson
follows his shortest story with what may be his longest — a generation ship
novella of quiet, devastating beauty.

Plus: letters from our Hugo-nominating readers (we know who you are, and we
are grateful), book reviews of the latest in imaginative fiction, and a
special feature on the future of radio astronomy.

Issue #63 will be available at newsstands and by subscription in May 1966.
