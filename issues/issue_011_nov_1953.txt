TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

It is November, and I find myself in a reflective mood. Eleven issues ago,
in a cramped office on West 46th Street that smelled of cigar smoke and
printer's ink, I sat down to write the first of these letters to you. I
did not know then whether anyone would read it. I did not know whether this
magazine -- this peculiar, stubborn, slightly improbable venture -- would
survive its first year. Now, with our twelfth issue already at the
printer's and our second year stretching out before us like an unmapped
star chart, I find that the appropriate word is one we Americans reserve
for this particular month: gratitude.

I am grateful, first, for the writers who have filled these pages with
stories that have exceeded every expectation I dared to form. When I
began soliciting manuscripts in the autumn of 1952, I hoped for
competence. What I received was brilliance -- not always, not in every
story, but often enough that I have spent this first year in a state of
genuine astonishment at the breadth and depth of imagination that the
science fiction community possesses. The six stories in this issue are,
I believe, among the finest we have published, and each one speaks, in
its own way, to the theme that has occupied my thoughts this month: what
do we leave behind?

I am grateful, second, for you. Your letters -- passionate, critical,
occasionally furious, always engaged -- have taught me that a magazine
is not a monologue but a conversation. You have argued with our science,
corrected our astronomy, championed your favorite authors, and demanded
more from writers you believe are not yet giving their best. You have
made us better. I hope we have returned the favor.

And I am grateful, third, for the enterprise itself: for the act of
imagining the future, which is, when you strip away the rockets and the
ray guns, an act of hope. To write about tomorrow is to believe that
there will be one. To read about it is to invest in that belief. In a
world that gives us daily reasons for pessimism, this seems to me a
worthy endeavor.

This issue's theme is legacy -- what we build, what endures, what is
remembered. Gunnar Eriksson opens our pages with a generation ship story
of breathtaking beauty. Theodore Cain delivers a war story unlike any
you have read. Cordell Beaumont paints an alien world so vivid you can
taste it. Hal Mercer builds and unbuildsa shipyard. Bob Finley puts an
ambassador in the most uncomfortable chair in the galaxy. And Danny
Kowalski sends a brave young girl into the longest night imaginable.

Six stories. Six meditations on what we leave behind among the stars. I
am enormously proud of each one.

As we approach our first anniversary, I want to offer one final word of
thanks: to Gerald Pulaski, whose cover paintings have defined the visual
identity of this magazine from the beginning; to our tireless copyeditor
Ruth Haywood, who catches the errors we cannot see; and to every
newsstand vendor, every subscription clerk, every postal worker who has
put this magazine into your hands. The future is a collaborative
enterprise, and it takes more hands than you might think to build it.

Happy Thanksgiving, dear reader. We have much to be thankful for.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                         CATHEDRAL OF ICE

                         by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The cathedral had taken forty-seven years to build, and it was never
finished.

This was, Astrid Halvorsen understood, the point. A cathedral that could
be completed was only a building. A cathedral that could never be
completed was a prayer made visible -- an acknowledgment that the sacred
was always larger than the space allotted for it. She had learned this
from her grandmother, who had learned it from the first ship-born priest,
Father Lindgren, who had spoken the first blessing over the first block
of ice set into the first wall, back when the Pilgrim's Rest was only
nine years out from Earth and the memory of sunlight was still a living
thing.

Now the memory of sunlight was an heirloom, passed from generation to
generation like a pressed flower, beautiful and dry and impossible to
revive. Astrid had never seen a sun. She had been born in the ship's
medical bay, in the year of the crossing that the navigational computer
designated as Transit Year 187, and her entire world was the interior
of the Pilgrim's Rest: seven kilometers of corridor, forty-two habitation
decks, the hydroponic gardens that smelled of wet earth and chlorophyll,
the machine shops that smelled of ozone and lubricant, and the cathedral.

The cathedral smelled of nothing. Ice has no scent. But it had a sound --
a deep, subsonic hum that Astrid felt in her sternum rather than heard
with her ears, a resonance created by the vibration of the ship's engines
transmitted through the hull and into the frozen walls. Her grandmother
had called it the voice of God. The engineers called it harmonic
interference. Astrid called it home.

She stood now in the nave, her breath forming small clouds in the cold
air, her hands thrust deep into the pockets of her heavy wool cassock.
The cassock was ship-made, woven from recycled fiber on the textile
deck, and it was the same dull grey as everything else on the Pilgrim's
Rest. Color was a luxury the ship could not afford. But the cathedral
did not need color. It had light.

The walls of the cathedral were translucent. The ice had been harvested
from comets -- great dirty snowballs that the ship's collection drones
intercepted during the long crossing between stars -- and each block
contained its own history: mineral traces that created veins of amber
and copper and pale green, trapped bubbles of ancient gas that caught
the light from the cathedral's lamps and scattered it into soft,
shifting patterns on the floor. No two blocks were alike. No two hours
in the cathedral looked the same. The light moved through the ice the
way music moves through silence: slowly, unpredictably, revealing depths
that had been invisible a moment before.

Astrid knew every block. She had cataloged them as a young acolyte,
crawling along the walls with a hand-light, recording the provenance
of each piece: Comet 2291, intercepted in Transit Year 43, containing
traces of iron oxide that gave it a ruddy warmth; Comet 2847, from
Transit Year 89, almost pure water ice, clear as glass, through which
you could see the structural beams of the hull beyond; Comet 3156, from
Transit Year 112, veined with something the chemists could not identify,
something that fluoresced a deep violet under ultraviolet light and
that the congregation had taken to calling grace.

She had been ordained at twenty-two, the youngest priest in the ship's
history, and she had served the cathedral for eleven years. In that
time she had performed 847 services, 193 marriages, 56 funerals, and
the blessing of every child born on the ship -- an average of fourteen
per year, a number that declined slightly with each generation as the
population stabilized. She had heard confessions in the small chamber
behind the altar where the ice was thickest and the silence most
complete. She had sat with the dying in the ship's hospice, holding
hands that grew cold as the spaces between stars. She had baptized
infants with water melted from the cathedral walls -- a tradition begun
by Father Lindgren, who believed that sacred water should come from
sacred ice.

And now they wanted to melt it all.


                              II.

Chief Engineer Kjell Nordstrom was not a cruel man. Astrid knew this.
She had grown up three decks below his family's quarters, had played
with his daughter Maren in the corridors of the habitation ring, had
attended his wife's funeral two years ago when the cancer took her. He
was a practical man who loved the ship the way Astrid loved the
cathedral: with a devotion that was indistinguishable from duty. His
hands were scarred from decades of work in the machine shops, and his
eyes had the permanent squint of a man who spent his days reading
gauges and measuring tolerances.

He sat across from her now in the council chamber, a room that served
as the ship's only meeting space, its walls bare metal, its chairs
bolted to the floor. Between them lay a sheaf of printouts covered in
numbers that Astrid could not read but that she understood perfectly
well.

"The water recyclers are failing," Nordstrom said. His voice was calm,
the way an engineer's voice is calm when describing a structural
failure: not because the situation was not serious, but because panic
was not a useful tool. "Unit Three went offline last month. Unit One
is operating at sixty-two percent capacity. Unit Two is holding, but
the filtration membranes are degrading faster than we can manufacture
replacements."

"How long?" Astrid asked.

"At current consumption rates, we have adequate water for eighteen
months. If we implement rationing -- which I recommend -- we can
extend that to twenty-six. But the Tau Ceti approach is thirty-one
months away. We will run short."

The numbers hung in the air between them, as cold and factual as the
ice in the cathedral walls.

"You want the cathedral," Astrid said. It was not a question.

Nordstrom did not flinch, but something moved behind his eyes -- a
shadow, quick and involuntary, the way a man's hand might move
toward a wound he is pretending does not hurt. He had been born in
the cathedral, Astrid knew. His mother had carried him there on his
first day of life, as all mothers did, and the ship's priest of that
era -- Father Sundberg, a gentle man with hands like shovel blades --
had touched water to his forehead and spoken the words of welcome that
had been spoken over every child born on the Pilgrim's Rest for a
hundred and sixty years. Nordstrom was not a believer. He had not
attended services in twenty years. But he had been married in the
cathedral, and his wife's funeral had been held there, and Astrid
knew that the ice walls held memories for him that had nothing to do
with water recyclers and everything to do with grief.

Nordstrom had the grace to look uncomfortable. "The cathedral contains
approximately four hundred and seventy metric tons of water ice.
Melted and purified, it would provide an additional fourteen months of
supply at current consumption rates. Combined with rationing, it would
see us through to Tau Ceti with a comfortable margin."

"A comfortable margin," Astrid repeated.

"Eight months' surplus. Enough to account for unforeseen complications
during orbital insertion and initial planetfall operations."

Astrid looked at the printouts. The numbers were indifferent to her
feelings. Numbers always were. "And there is no other source?"

"We have surveyed every non-essential water reserve on the ship. The
hydroponic gardens cannot be reduced without compromising food
production. The cooling systems cannot be tapped without risking
reactor instability. The personal reserves in the habitation quarters
are already minimal." He paused. "The cathedral is the only
discretionary water reserve on the Pilgrim's Rest."

Discretionary. The word sat in Astrid's chest like a stone. Forty-seven
years of devotion, 847 services, the baptismal water of every child born
on the ship for the last century -- and it was discretionary.

"The council has voted?" she asked.

"The council will vote tomorrow. I wanted to speak with you first. Out
of respect."

Astrid studied his face. The respect was genuine. So was the
determination. Nordstrom was not asking permission. He was offering
warning.

"I appreciate that, Kjell," she said. "May I have the night to think?"

"Of course."


                              III.

She returned to the cathedral at the end of the second watch, when the
ship's lights had dimmed to simulate the night that no one aboard had
ever experienced. The cathedral was empty. It was almost always empty
now. Attendance had been declining for years -- each generation a little
less interested in the rituals of a religion that had been designed for
a world they had never seen, a sky they had never stood beneath, a sun
whose warmth was a theological abstraction.

Astrid did not blame them. Faith was difficult enough on Earth, where
you could at least point to a sunset and say, There -- do you see? How
much more difficult it was in a metal tube between the stars, where
beauty had to be manufactured and transcendence was a luxury item
competing for resources with water recyclers and air scrubbers.

And yet.

She walked slowly down the nave, her boots quiet on the metal floor.
The lamps were set to their nighttime register, a low amber glow that
turned the ice walls into something almost alive -- a slow pulse of
golden light moving through translucent depths, as if the cathedral
were breathing. She reached the altar, a simple block of the purest
ice they had ever harvested, from Comet 3412 in Transit Year 141. It
was perfectly clear, so transparent that you could see the altar cloth
folded inside it -- placed there by Father Lindgren's successor,
Mother Berglund, who had sealed the cloth within a hollow carved in
the ice and then filled with water that froze around it, preserving
it like an insect in amber. The cloth was white linen, brought from
Earth, one of the last artifacts of the world they had left behind.

Astrid placed her hands on the altar. The cold was immediate and
absolute, a sensation so intense that it bypassed pain and became
something else -- a clarity, a simplicity, a reduction of experience
to its most essential element: the boundary between warmth and cold,
between the living body and the indifferent universe.

She prayed. Not in words -- words were insufficient for what she felt --
but in silence, which was the only language large enough to contain
her grief and her doubt and her stubborn, irrational conviction that
this place mattered.

The cathedral had no practical value. This was true. It did not
generate power, did not recycle air, did not produce food, did not
advance the ship toward its destination. It was, by any rational
accounting, a waste of resources -- four hundred and seventy metric
tons of water frozen into walls and pillars and arches that served no
function except to be beautiful.

But Astrid had stood in this nave and watched a woman weep for her dead
husband, and the light through the ice had turned her tears to gold.
She had watched children chase each other through the aisles, their
laughter echoing off walls that were older than their grandparents.
She had watched an old man sit alone in the back row for three hours,
saying nothing, needing nothing except the silence and the light. She
had watched two women exchange wedding vows at the altar, their breath
mingling in the cold air, and she had thought: this is what we are for.
Not the destination. Not the planet at the end of the journey. This.
This moment of beauty in the dark between stars.

Was that worth dying for?

She did not know. She was not sure that was the right question.


                              IV.

The council chamber held forty-two seats -- one for each deck -- and
every seat was occupied. Captain Maren Nordstrom presided from the head
of the table. That she was the chief engineer's daughter was a
complication that everyone acknowledged and no one discussed. The
Pilgrim's Rest was too small for the luxury of recusal; everyone was
related to everyone, and decisions had to be made by the people
available to make them.

Astrid sat in the observer's chair, a courtesy extended to the ship's
priest but carrying no vote. She had spent the night in the cathedral,
not sleeping but not exactly awake either, existing in a state of
suspended attention that she had learned from years of meditation -- a
quietness that allowed thoughts to surface without being pursued.

By morning, she had reached not a conclusion but something adjacent to
one: a feeling, a direction, the beginning of an argument that she did
not yet fully understand.

Nordstrom presented his numbers. He was thorough and precise, and the
numbers were devastating. The water situation was worse than Astrid
had realized. The recyclers were not merely aging; they were
approaching a failure mode that the original designers had not
anticipated, because the original designers had expected the voyage to
last eighty years, not two hundred. The Pilgrim's Rest had outlived
its specifications. Everything was failing slowly, gracefully, and
irreversibly, the way all human constructions eventually fail when
confronted with enough time.

The council listened in silence. When Nordstrom finished, Captain
Nordstrom turned to Astrid.

"The council recognizes the ship's priest," she said. "Astrid, do you
wish to speak?"

Astrid stood. She had not prepared remarks. She had decided, sometime
in the blue hours of the morning, that prepared remarks would be a
form of dishonesty -- that what she owed these people was not rhetoric
but truth, and that the truth could only emerge in the act of speaking
it.

"I am not going to argue with the numbers," she said. "Chief Engineer
Nordstrom's analysis is correct. The water situation is critical. The
cathedral contains water that could extend our supply. These are facts,
and I respect facts."

She paused. The council waited.

"I want to ask a different question. Not whether we can afford to keep
the cathedral, but what we lose if we destroy it."

She looked around the table. Forty-two faces, representing twelve
hundred souls, the entire population of a world seven kilometers long,
hurtling through the void at twelve percent of the speed of light.

"We have been traveling for one hundred and eighty-seven years. In
that time, we have lost many things. We have lost the sun, the wind,
the rain, the smell of growing things rooted in actual soil. We have
lost horizons. We have lost the experience of walking in a straight
line for more than three and a half kilometers. We have lost birds,
and rivers, and the sound of thunder." She paused. "We have made
peace with these losses. We have found substitutes, or we have learned
to live without. But the cathedral is not a substitute for anything.
It is not a replacement for a church on Earth. It is something that
could only exist here, on this ship, in this crossing. It was built
by people who had lost everything and who chose, despite that loss,
to build something beautiful."

She felt the words taking shape as she spoke them, felt them arranging
themselves into an argument she had not known she possessed.

"If we melt the cathedral, we will have water. Fourteen months of
water. And we will arrive at Tau Ceti alive, and we will step onto a
new world, and we will begin the work of building a civilization. But
we will arrive as people who, when forced to choose between beauty and
survival, chose survival. And I am not certain that a civilization
founded on that choice is one worth building."

The silence that followed was long enough to be its own kind of
statement.

Councilor Bergman, who represented the agricultural decks, spoke first.
"With respect, Priest Halvorsen, dead people build nothing. Not
civilizations, not cathedrals."

"That is true," Astrid said. "But I am not arguing for death. I am
arguing for a third option."

Captain Nordstrom leaned forward. "What third option?"

"Harvest new ice."

The silence changed quality. Nordstrom the elder -- the chief engineer
-- shifted in his seat.

"We are thirty-one months from Tau Ceti," Astrid said. "Our trajectory
passes through the outer reaches of the system. The long-range sensors
have identified at least seventeen cometary bodies in the Oort cloud
along our approach vector. Send the collection drones. Harvest fresh
ice. Replenish the water supply without destroying the cathedral."

"The drones are forty years old," Nordstrom said. "They were designed
for opportunistic collection, not targeted missions. The power
requirements for a dedicated harvest operation would strain the reactor
allocation, and the risk of drone failure--"

"Is a risk," Astrid said. "Yes. Everything is a risk. The recyclers
are a risk. The reactor is a risk. The hull is a risk. We have been
living with risk for a hundred and eighty-seven years. I am asking us
to take one more risk, in exchange for keeping the one thing on this
ship that exists for no reason except that it is beautiful."

Councilor Eriksen from the engineering deck raised his hand. "If the
drones fail, we'll have wasted power and time and we'll still need to
melt the cathedral. Only with less margin."

"Then we melt it," Astrid said. "If the drones fail and there is no
alternative, I will carry the first block to the recyclers myself. I
am not asking for a permanent exemption. I am asking for a chance."


                               V.

The vote was twenty-three to nineteen in favor of attempting the
harvest, with the provision that if the first three drone missions
failed to return viable ice, the cathedral would be deconstructed
immediately. It was the narrowest margin in the council's history, and
Astrid knew that at least five of her votes were sympathy rather than
conviction.

She did not care. A chance was a chance.

The first drone launched six days later, a battered collection unit
designated Harvester-7 that had been in service since Transit Year 94
and bore the scars of nearly a century of micrometeorite impacts. Astrid
watched the launch from the observation gallery -- a narrow chamber on
the ship's dorsal surface fitted with a strip of transparent aluminum
that provided the only direct view of exterior space anywhere on the
Pilgrim's Rest.

She had come here often as a child. It was the closest thing the ship
had to a window, and through it you could see what the passengers of
the Pilgrim's Rest almost never saw: the universe. It was not what she
had expected, the first time. She had imagined stars like the ones in
the old pictures -- bright points against black velvet, dense and
generous. But the real stars were sparse and cold, scattered across a
darkness so absolute that it made the darkness inside the ship seem
cozy by comparison. The void was not empty. It was full -- full of
distance, full of silence, full of a patient, indifferent vastness
that made the Pilgrim's Rest feel like a mote of dust on the surface
of an ocean.

Harvester-7 was a small, ungainly craft, all tanks and grappling arms
and thruster pods, and it moved away from the ship with the cautious
slowness of a very old animal venturing out of its burrow. Astrid
watched it until it was too small to see, and then she watched the
space where it had been, and then she went back to the cathedral and
prayed.

The drone was gone for eleven days. The mission had been calculated for
eight. By the ninth day, the engineering deck was preparing contingency
plans for the cathedral's deconstruction. Astrid heard the whispers in
the corridors -- the engineers talking in low voices about ice-cutting
tools and melt-rate calculations, the quiet, practical conversations
of people preparing to dismantle something they did not entirely want
to dismantle but that pragmatism demanded. She heard a maintenance
worker tell another that it was "a shame, really, a real shame," and
she heard the other reply, "a shame won't keep you alive at Tau Ceti,"
and both of them were right, and the rightness of both positions was
the thing that made this so hard.

On the morning of the tenth day, Nordstrom came to the cathedral in
person, his face grim.

"If it's not back by tomorrow, I'm calling the council," he said. "We
can't afford to send another drone after a lost one."

Astrid nodded. She had made a promise, and she would keep it.

On the eleventh day, at 0347 hours, the ship's communications array
detected a return signal. Harvester-7 was inbound, moving slowly,
its tanks full.

Astrid was in the cathedral when the announcement came over the ship's
intercom. She was alone, as she usually was, kneeling on the cold metal
floor before the altar with its sealed cloth. She heard the watch
officer's voice -- calm, professional, almost bored -- report that the
drone had returned with approximately eighty-three metric tons of water
ice, composition analysis pending.

Eighty-three tons. Not enough to solve the problem. But enough to begin.

She did not move. She knelt on the cold floor and felt the subsonic
hum of the engines in her bones, and she let the tears come, and the
light from the ice walls caught them and made them shine.


                              VI.

Over the next fourteen months, the drones made nine more flights.
Harvester-7, having proven itself, became the mission's workhorse,
supplemented by Harvester-3 and Harvester-12, which the engineering
team coaxed back into service with replacement parts fabricated in the
machine shops. Not every mission succeeded. Harvester-3 was lost on
its third flight, its signal simply ceasing midway through the return
trajectory. Harvester-12 returned from one mission with its tanks
contaminated by ammonia ice that could not be economically purified.

But the successes outweighed the failures. By the time the Pilgrim's
Rest entered the Tau Ceti system, the water reserves had been
replenished to ninety-four percent of capacity -- more than enough for
orbital insertion, atmospheric analysis, and the first landing
operations. Nordstrom's recyclers, given the reduced demand, stabilized
at a sustainable operating level. The crisis, like so many crises
before it, had been survived through a combination of engineering
ingenuity and what Nordstrom grudgingly called "blind, stubborn luck."

Astrid called it something else, but she kept that to herself.

The cathedral survived.

More than that: it grew. The ice from the new harvests was different
from the old -- Tau Ceti's comets carried different mineral signatures,
different trace elements, different histories. The new blocks, when
fitted into the cathedral walls, created a visible boundary between the
old ice and the new, a geological record of the voyage written in
frozen water. The old ice, from the deep void between stars, was pale
and clean, its colors subtle -- faint ambers, ghostly greens. The new
ice, from the Tau Ceti system, was richer, darker, veined with
compounds that the chemists were still cataloging. Where old met new,
the contrast was striking: a line of demarcation that told the story of
a journey from one star to another, written in the only medium the
ship had in abundance.

Astrid found this beautiful beyond words. The cathedral was not merely
preserved; it was transformed. It had become a record of the crossing
itself, a document written in ice and light that would tell future
generations not just that the voyage had happened but what it had felt
like -- the long emptiness, and then the arrival, the old light giving
way to the new.

On the day the Pilgrim's Rest achieved orbit around Tau Ceti IV --
the planet the old records called New Copenhagen, though no one had
used that name in generations -- Astrid held a service in the
cathedral. It was the best-attended service in years. The nave was
full, packed with people who had come not out of faith, necessarily,
but out of a need to mark the moment in a space that felt adequate
to the occasion. The habitation decks were too small. The observation
gallery was too narrow. Only the cathedral had room enough for what
they felt.

Astrid stood at the altar, her hands resting on the ice, and looked
out at the faces of her congregation. Twelve hundred people. The
entire population of a world. They had been born in the void, had
lived their lives in a metal tube, had never felt rain on their faces
or grass beneath their feet. Tomorrow they would begin the descent.
Tomorrow they would step onto a world with a sky.

She did not give a sermon. She had thought about it all night, had
drafted and discarded a dozen texts, and in the end she had decided
that this was not a moment for words. She stood in silence, and the
congregation stood in silence with her, and the light moved through
the cathedral walls -- old light and new light, void light and star
light -- and the subsonic hum of the engines, which had been the
heartbeat of their world for two hundred years, slowed and steadied
as the ship settled into its orbit.

After a long time -- five minutes, or ten, or perhaps longer; no one
was counting -- Astrid spoke. She said only two words.

"We're here."

And the cathedral of ice, built from the frozen tears of comets,
carried those words in its walls the way it carried everything: with
patience, and beauty, and the quiet conviction that some things are
worth preserving, even at the edge of survival, even in the dark
between stars.


                              VII.

They did not take the cathedral with them to the surface. This was
never discussed; it was simply understood. The cathedral belonged to
the ship, to the crossing, to the void. It was not a thing that could
be transplanted. On the surface they would build new things -- houses,
roads, farms, and eventually, perhaps, a new cathedral, made of stone
or wood or whatever material this new world offered. But the cathedral
of ice would remain in orbit, a monument to the journey, a frozen
prayer circling a new sun.

Astrid was among the last to leave the ship. She spent the final night
alone in the cathedral, sitting in the nave as she had sat a thousand
times before, watching the light move through the walls. She thought
about her grandmother, who had taught her that a cathedral is never
finished. She thought about Father Lindgren, who had blessed the first
block of ice. She thought about the forty-seven years of construction,
the countless hands that had carved and fitted and polished, the
generations of worshippers who had passed through these walls carrying
their joys and their griefs, their prayers and their silences.

She thought about Nordstrom, who had wanted to melt it all, and she
felt no anger, only a vast and quiet gratitude -- because without his
threat, she would never have fought for the cathedral, and without
fighting for it, she would never have understood why it mattered.

It mattered because it was unnecessary. Because in a world where every
gram of mass and every joule of energy was allocated to the grim
business of survival, someone had chosen to do something useless and
beautiful. Because the cathedral served no function except to remind
its builders that survival was not the same as living, that arriving
was not the same as having made the journey, that a people who could
not create beauty in the dark did not deserve the light waiting for
them at the end.

Astrid placed her hands on the altar one last time. The cold was
familiar now -- not painful but clarifying, a boundary between what
she was and what the universe was, a reminder that consciousness was
a warm, fragile, temporary thing surrounded by an infinite cold that
did not care about it but that could, with patience and craft and
faith, be made into something luminous.

She rose. She extinguished the lamps, one by one. The cathedral did
not go dark. It never went dark. The ice held the light -- held it
the way memory holds experience, the way faith holds truth, the way
love holds the beloved long after the beloved is gone. In the
darkness, the walls glowed with a faint, residual luminescence, the
last photons bouncing between crystal planes, losing energy so slowly
that the glow would persist for hours, perhaps days, growing dimmer
and dimmer but never quite reaching zero, never quite surrendering to
the dark.

Astrid walked out of the cathedral and closed the door behind her.
She did not look back. She did not need to. The cathedral was behind
her and inside her and ahead of her, all at once -- a structure built
from ice and time and the stubborn human refusal to let beauty perish,
even in the void, even at the edge of everything.

On the surface, they said, there was weather. Rain and wind and the
smell of soil. She had never experienced any of these things, but she
had read about them, and she had imagined them, and she thought that
perhaps the most remarkable thing about arriving at a new world was not
the strangeness of it but the recognition -- the discovery that the
things you had imagined, the things you had prayed for, the things you
had preserved in ice against the long dark of the crossing, were real
after all.

She boarded the last shuttle. She did not look back.

The cathedral remained.

                    LEDGER OF WAR

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

Lewis Grant had been an accountant for the federal government for
twenty-two years, and in that time he had learned one fundamental
truth about numbers: they did not lie, but they could be arranged to
say almost anything. This was not a moral judgment. It was simply a
professional observation. Numbers were tools, and like all tools, they
served the purposes of the people who wielded them.

The people who wielded them now were the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and
their purpose was to win a war.

Grant sat at his desk on the fourteenth floor of the Department of
Interstellar Affairs building in Washington, D.C., a desk that was
identical to every other desk in the building -- grey metal,
government-issue, with a slight wobble in the left front leg that he
had corrected with a folded piece of cardboard. The desk held a
typewriter, a stack of manila folders, a cup of coffee that had gone
cold two hours ago, and the most important document in human history.

He did not know this yet. He was still working on page 47.

The document was officially designated ISA-7741: A Comprehensive
Accounting of Material and Personnel Expenditures Related to Operation
Distant Thunder, Fiscal Years 2187-2193. It was, in plainer language, a
spreadsheet of the costs of humanity's first interstellar war. Grant
had been assigned to compile it three months ago by his supervisor,
a nervous man named Carver who had been told by his supervisor to
produce a "complete budgetary analysis" for the Senate Armed Services
Committee, which had been told by its chairman to find out exactly how
much the war had cost before voting on the next appropriation.

The question was straightforward. The answer was not.

"The problem," Grant explained to his wife Helen that evening over
meatloaf and mashed potatoes, "is definition. What counts as a cost?"

Helen, who had been married to an accountant long enough to know that
this was not a rhetorical question, set down her fork. "Everything,
I would think."

"That's what I thought too. But Carver says the generals only want
material costs. Equipment, fuel, ordnance, facility construction.
Hardware. They want a number they can put in a report and say, 'This
is what the war cost,' and have it sound reasonable."

"What's reasonable?"

Grant looked at his mashed potatoes. "Four hundred and twelve billion
dollars. That's the hardware number. Equipment losses, fuel
expenditure, ordnance consumed, facility construction and
decommissioning. Four hundred and twelve billion, give or take."

"That sounds like a lot."

"It is a lot. But it's a clean number. It fits on a page. The Senate
can read it and nod and say, 'Well, that's the price of security,'
and vote for the next appropriation, and everyone goes home feeling
like responsible adults."

Helen studied him. She had been married to him for nineteen years and
she could read his face the way he read a balance sheet: every line
item visible, every discrepancy noted. "But that's not the real
number."

"No," Grant said. "That's not the real number."

He had started with the hardware, because the hardware was easy. You
could count ships. You could count missiles. You could add up fuel
costs and maintenance schedules and depreciation rates and come out
with a number that was precise to the penny, because hardware existed
in a world of receipts and invoices and serial numbers. Hardware was
the part of war that accountants were built to understand.

But then he had moved on to personnel.

Personnel was harder. The military maintained excellent records of its
own losses -- 47,283 service members killed in action, 12,891 missing
and presumed dead, 93,416 wounded, of whom 31,207 were permanently
disabled. These numbers were available. These numbers were official.
These numbers had already been published in the newspapers and debated
in the Senate and mourned at memorial services across the country.

But Grant's training had taught him that every line item had a context.
A killed soldier was not merely a killed soldier. A killed soldier was
a training investment -- $287,000 in basic training, technical
training, and specialized certifications, on average. A killed soldier
was a lost economic output -- lifetime earnings foregone, estimated at
$1.2 million for the average enlisted person, $2.8 million for the
average officer. A killed soldier was a survivor benefit -- $400,000
in death gratuity, plus ongoing payments to dependents, plus
educational benefits for children. A killed soldier was a recruitment
cost -- the expense of training a replacement, which had risen to
$342,000 per person as the war dragged on and volunteers grew scarce.

Grant calculated all of this. It was his job. He put the numbers in
columns and rows and checked them twice, because an accountant who
did not check his work twice was not an accountant but a gambler.

And then he moved on to civilians.

The war had been fought in three star systems: Alpha Centauri, Epsilon
Eridani, and Tau Ceti. All three systems contained human colonies --
settlements that had been established over the previous century by
successive waves of colonists who had left Earth seeking opportunity,
adventure, or simply distance from a home world that felt increasingly
crowded and contentious. The war had begun over mining rights in the
Centauri asteroid belt and had expanded, as wars do, far beyond its
original causes, engulfing all three systems in a conflict that lasted
six years and left large portions of three colonies in ruins.

The civilian cost of the war was not a number that the generals
wanted in the report. Grant knew this because Carver had told him so,
explicitly, on the second day of the project.

"Stick to military expenditures, Lewis. That's what the committee
asked for."

"The committee asked for a comprehensive accounting," Grant said.

"Comprehensive of military expenditures."

"That's not what comprehensive means."

Carver had looked at him with the weary expression of a man who
understood the difference between what words meant and what they were
intended to mean. "Lewis. The generals want a clean report. The
senators want a clean vote. Everyone wants this to be simple. Don't
make it complicated."

Grant had nodded, and gone back to his desk, and finished the
authorized report in two weeks flat. ISA-7741 was 47 pages of clean,
defensible numbers. Four hundred and twelve billion dollars. It
accounted for every missile fired, every hull breached, every fuel
cell expended. It was, by the standards of government accounting, a
fine piece of work. Carver was pleased. The generals would be pleased.
The senators would read it, nod their heads, and appropriate the
funds for the next round of military expansion, and the machinery of
governance would continue to turn, and Lewis Grant would get a
satisfactory performance review and perhaps a small raise, and
everyone would go home.

Grant went home. He ate dinner with Helen and Margaret. He helped
Margaret with her algebra -- she was struggling with quadratic
equations, which Grant found secretly delightful, because quadratic
equations were beautiful and he enjoyed sharing their beauty with
his daughter, who did not yet see it but who would, eventually,
because beauty had a way of revealing itself to anyone who spent
enough time in its company.

After dinner, he sat at the kitchen table and stared at the wall.

Helen brought him a cup of coffee. She did not ask what he was
thinking about. She had been married to him long enough to recognize
the quality of his silence -- this was not the silence of a man who
was tired or distracted, but the silence of a man who was making a
decision, and Helen knew that Lewis Grant's decisions, once made,
were as unalterable as his arithmetic.

He began a second document.

He did not tell Carver about the second document. It was not, strictly
speaking, authorized. But Grant had been a government accountant for
twenty-two years, and in that time he had learned a second fundamental
truth: sometimes the most important work is the work nobody asked
you to do.

The second document began with the colonies.

Alpha Centauri B-II, population 340,000. Orbital bombardment in the
third year of the war had destroyed the colony's primary agricultural
dome, resulting in a famine that killed 12,400 people over the
following eight months. The colony's hospital had been destroyed in the
same bombardment, and an additional 3,200 people died of injuries and
illnesses that would have been treatable under normal conditions. The
economic impact -- destroyed infrastructure, lost agricultural
output, displaced populations -- was estimated at $47 billion, but
Grant knew that estimate was low, because it did not account for the
generational effects: children not born, educations not completed,
careers not pursued, communities not rebuilt.

Epsilon Eridani III, population 890,000. The battle of the Eridani
Gap, the war's largest engagement, had taken place in the colony's
orbital space, and debris from destroyed warships had rained down on
the surface for weeks afterward. The death toll from the debris fall
was 2,100, but the contamination from reactor cores and weapons
systems had rendered four thousand square kilometers uninhabitable,
displacing 120,000 colonists and creating a refugee crisis that was
still ongoing. Cost: incalculable, but Grant calculated it anyway,
because that was what accountants did.

Tau Ceti IV, population 1,200,000. The war's most devastating ground
battle had been fought on the outskirts of New Copenhagen, the colony's
capital city. The battle lasted eleven days. When it was over, New
Copenhagen's eastern district -- home to 85,000 people -- no longer
existed. The civilian death toll was 14,800. The number of people
permanently displaced was 71,000. The psychological casualties -- a
category that the military did not officially recognize but that
Grant included in his second document under the heading "Human Cost,
Non-Fatal" -- were impossible to quantify but impossible to ignore.

Grant worked on the second document for six weeks. He worked on it at
home, in the evenings, at the same kitchen table where he ate dinner
with Helen and helped his daughter Margaret with her algebra homework.
He used his own paper and his own typewriter, because government
resources were for government work and this was -- he was not entirely
sure what this was. An act of conscience, perhaps. Or an act of
compulsion. He was an accountant, and the numbers existed, and an
accountant who knew the numbers existed and chose not to count them
was not an accountant but a liar.

Margaret asked him once what he was working on. She was thirteen,
sharp-eyed, and she had noticed that her father was spending his
evenings typing instead of listening to the radio or reading the
newspaper, and that his typing had a different quality than usual --
slower, more deliberate, with long pauses between the clatter of keys
that suggested he was thinking about each word before committing it
to paper.

"A project," he said.

"For work?"

"For the record."

She accepted this the way children accept the mysteries of their
parents' lives -- without understanding but with trust. She went back
to her algebra, and Grant went back to his typewriter, and the clock
on the kitchen wall ticked with the patient regularity of a universe
that did not care about the numbers being typed beneath it but that
would, eventually, be held accountable by them.

Helen read the document. She read it one evening while Grant was
giving Margaret a bath, sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of
tea that went cold in her hands. When Grant came back downstairs, she
was on page 93, and her face had the particular stillness of a person
who is absorbing something too large for an immediate reaction.

"This is dangerous," she said.

"Yes."

"You could lose your job."

"Probably."

She looked at him. "Is it right?"

"The numbers are right."

"That's not what I asked."

Grant sat down across from her. They had been married for nineteen
years, and in that time they had navigated the usual mathematics of
a shared life: the addition of a daughter, the subtraction of his
mother, the multiplication of expenses, the division of
responsibilities. They had never had a conversation like this one,
and Grant found that the same skills applied. You looked at the
numbers. You checked your work. You told the truth.

"Yes," he said. "It's right."

She nodded, and went back to reading, and did not say another word
until she reached page 147.

The second document grew. Page by page, column by column, it expanded
to include categories that Grant had not originally anticipated: the
cost of rebuilding destroyed infrastructure, the cost of unexploded
ordnance removal, the cost of environmental remediation, the cost of
war orphan care, the cost of veteran rehabilitation, the cost of
diplomatic reparations, the cost of memorial construction, the cost
of historical documentation. Each category spawned subcategories. Each
subcategory generated questions that led to more research, more
numbers, more pages.

By the time he reached page 147, the second document had become
something he had not intended: a complete portrait of a war, drawn
entirely in numbers. It was not a narrative. It had no heroes and no
villains, no arguments for or against the conflict, no political
analysis, no moral judgment. It was simply an accounting -- a
meticulous, exhaustive, devastating accounting of everything the war
had cost, in dollars and in lives and in futures that would never exist
because the people who would have lived them were dead.

The total was $3.7 trillion.

Grant typed this number at the bottom of the last page, leaned back
in his kitchen chair, and stared at it. It was a meaningless number.
No human mind could comprehend $3.7 trillion. It was too large to be
felt, too abstract to be mourned, too comprehensive to be argued with.
And yet it was correct. He had checked every calculation. He had
verified every source. The number was right.

He did not know what to do with it.

He considered destroying it. He considered filing it. He considered
sending it to the Senate Armed Services Committee anonymously, or to
a newspaper, or to no one at all. For three days he did nothing except
go to work, come home, eat dinner, and look at the document sitting
in his desk drawer like a letter bomb that he had built by accident.

On the fourth day, he made a decision.

He went to the office early, before Carver arrived, and placed the
second document on Carver's desk with a memo that read: "Supplementary
analysis. For the committee's consideration, if appropriate. -- L.
Grant."

Then he went to his own desk, sat down, and began working on the
next fiscal quarter's budget projections, because the world did not
stop for revelations, and an accountant who missed a deadline was an
accountant looking for a new job.

Carver found the document at 8:15 AM. By 8:47 he was in Grant's office,
the sheaf of papers held at arm's length as though it might be
contagious.

"What is this?"

"It's a supplementary analysis," Grant said. "I thought the committee
might want the complete picture."

"The complete--" Carver set the document on Grant's desk and took a
step back. "Lewis, do you understand what would happen if the committee
saw this?"

"They would know what the war cost."

"They don't want to know what the war cost! They want to know what
the war cost in a way that lets them vote for more money without
feeling bad about it! That's why they asked for a comprehensive
military expenditure report and not a-- a--" He gestured at the
document. "Whatever this is."

"It's an accounting," Grant said. "It's what I do."

Carver stared at him. There was something in his expression that might
have been pity, or might have been envy, or might have been the
dawning realization that he was standing in the presence of a man who
was either very brave or very foolish and that the distinction might
not matter.

"If the generals see this," Carver said slowly, "they will want it
destroyed."

"I imagine they will."

"And if it gets to the press--"

"I didn't write it for the press. I wrote it for the record."

"What record?"

Grant looked at his supervisor -- this nervous, well-meaning man who
had spent his career navigating the space between what was true and
what was permissible -- and felt a sudden, surprising wave of
compassion. "The record that says someone counted," he said. "That's
all. Someone counted."

Carver picked up the document. He held it for a long moment, and Grant
could see him calculating -- not numbers, but consequences, the
algebra of career survival, the arithmetic of courage.

"I'll read it tonight," Carver said finally. "And then we'll see."

He left. Grant watched him go, and then he turned back to his
typewriter and his budget projections, and the cup of coffee that had
gone cold, and the quiet, persistent hum of the fluorescent lights
overhead, which sounded, if you listened carefully, like the universe
itself, ticking over, one number at a time.

Three weeks later, a copy of ISA-7741-S -- the "S" stood for
"supplementary," though Grant suspected it would come to stand for
something else -- appeared on the desk of Senator Ruth Koenig of
Minnesota, the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee. No one
claimed responsibility for putting it there. Carver denied any
involvement. Grant said nothing.

Senator Koenig read it over a weekend. On Monday morning, she entered
the chamber and requested an emergency session. She placed the
document into the Congressional Record, all 147 pages of it, and then
she did something that Grant had not anticipated: she read the final
page aloud.

The total. $3.7 trillion.

And then the breakdowns. The cost per colony. The cost per civilian
death. The cost per orphan. The cost per square kilometer of
contaminated land.

And then the number that Grant had almost not included, the number
that had kept him up at night, the number that had made him set down
his pencil and stare at the wall of his kitchen for twenty minutes
while his coffee went cold: the cost per soldier killed in action,
calculated not in training dollars or economic output or survivor
benefits but in the simplest possible terms.

One human life, duration approximately seventy-eight years, encompassing
on average the formation of 847 significant relationships, the
consumption of 54,000 meals, the experience of 28,470 sunrises, the
speaking of approximately 860 million words, the dreaming of
approximately 100,000 dreams.

Cost: everything.

Senator Koenig set down the document. The chamber was silent. The
appropriation was tabled.

Lewis Grant heard about it on the evening news, sitting in his
kitchen with Helen and Margaret, eating meatloaf and mashed potatoes.
Helen looked at him across the table. She did not say anything. She
did not need to. She had been married to an accountant long enough to
know that the most important numbers were the ones that could not be
counted, and that the most important work was the work nobody asked
you to do.

Grant ate his meatloaf. It was good meatloaf. Helen made excellent
meatloaf.

The next morning, he went to work and started on the quarterly
projections, because the work went on, and the numbers went on, and
an accountant who stopped counting was not an accountant but a man
with a desk and a cold cup of coffee, and Lewis Grant was an
accountant.

He had always been an accountant.

He checked his work twice.

                       FEAST OF THE FORGOTTEN

                       by Cordell Beaumont

================================================================================

                              I.

The banquet hall stood at the heart of the ruined city like a cathedral
of appetite, its vaulted ceiling open to a sky the color of ripe
persimmons, its walls carved from a stone so deeply crimson that it
seemed to pulse with the memory of heat. Simone Delacroix stood in
the entrance and felt the breath leave her body the way it always did
when she encountered something beautiful enough to override the
rational mind -- a sudden, involuntary surrender, as though the eyes
had made a decision that the brain was not yet prepared to endorse.

The hall was vast. It could have seated a thousand -- more, perhaps,
if the alien builders had been smaller than their furniture suggested.
The tables were arranged in concentric semicircles, each one carved
from a single piece of the same crimson stone that composed the walls,
and each one was still set.

That was the detail that had brought Simone across fourteen light-years
and three months of hyperspace transit: the tables were still set.
Plates of hammered copper, green with centuries of oxidation, sat at
each place in precise alignment. Drinking vessels -- tall, fluted
things that resembled tulips cast in onyx -- stood at the upper right
of each setting. Serving platters, wide as shields and intricately
embossed with designs that might have been decorative or might have
been linguistic, occupied the center of each table. Utensils --
three-tined implements that suggested forks but with a delicacy of
craftsmanship that elevated them to jewelry -- lay at each setting
in a pattern that implied ritual.

A meal had been prepared here. A great meal, a formal meal, a meal of
ceremony and significance. And no one had come to eat it.

"The food is long gone, of course," said Dr. Emile Renard, the
expedition's xenobotanist, who had been on the planet for three months
longer than Simone and had developed the proprietary air of a man who
considers himself the rightful host. He was a compact Marseillais with
a trimmed beard and an unfortunate tendency to explain things. "Whatever
was served decomposed millennia ago. But the residue analysis is
fascinating. The organic compounds in the serving vessels suggest a
cuisine of extraordinary complexity -- dozens of distinct protein
sources, an array of plant-based preparations that we're still
cataloging, fermented beverages of at least nine varieties."

Simone heard him the way one hears rain on a distant roof: present,
peripheral, ultimately irrelevant to the interior experience. She was
looking at the plates. Each one bore a design at its center, pressed
into the copper with a tool of remarkable precision. The designs were
different at every setting -- unique, as far as she could tell, each
one a small, intricate composition of curves and angles and dots that
resembled, more than anything, a fingerprint.

"Those are name markers," she said.

Renard paused mid-explanation. "We think they might be decorative--"

"They're name markers. Each plate has a unique design. Each seat has a
unique plate. These aren't interchangeable. They're assigned. Every
person who was meant to sit at this table had a place, and every place
was marked with something that identified them specifically." She
touched the edge of the nearest plate, running her fingers along the
rim, feeling the texture of the metal -- cool, rough, alive with the
granular detail of hand-hammering. "This wasn't a meal. It was an
invitation. A personal one."

She looked up at the vaulted ceiling. Through the gaps where the roof
had collapsed, she could see the sky -- that impossible persimmon sky,
warm and dense, the color of a sunset that never ended because this
world's atmosphere scattered light in frequencies that human evolution
had not prepared her for. The light fell through the broken ceiling in
shafts of amber and coral, illuminating the dust that rose from the
ancient floor in slow, luxurious spirals, and where the light touched
the copper plates it turned them into coins of fire, each one blazing
with its own particular warmth.

Simone breathed in. The air smelled of stone and time and something
else -- something faint and sweet, like the ghost of a spice that had
been ground centuries ago and whose molecules still clung to the
crevices of the carved walls. She could not identify it. She did not
want to. Some scents were more powerful as mysteries.

"How many settings?" she asked.

"Four thousand, two hundred, and sixteen," Renard said. "We've counted
three times."

"Four thousand two hundred and sixteen people," Simone murmured. "All
invited to a meal that was never eaten."


                              II.

The planet had been designated Meridian-IV by the survey team, but
Simone had taken to calling it Auberge in her private notes -- the
French word for inn, a place where travelers rest and eat and share
stories before continuing on their way. It was an indulgence, naming
things; the International Xenoarchaeological Council frowned on
informal designations. But Simone had been an archaeologist for
twenty-three years, and she had learned that you could not understand
a place you could not name, and that official designations -- strings
of letters and numbers as soulless as tax forms -- told you nothing
about what a place felt like.

Auberge felt like a garden. That was the first thing you noticed when
you stepped outside the survey station and looked at the landscape: the
entire world was a garden. Not a wild garden, not a tangle of
undirected growth, but a cultivated one -- a landscape shaped by
deliberate hands over centuries or millennia, every plant placed with
intention, every grove and meadow and waterway arranged in a
composition that balanced utility and beauty with the precision of a
master chef balancing flavors in a sauce.

The trees were extraordinary. They grew in groves of seven or nine --
always odd numbers, Simone noted, never even -- and their trunks were
wrapped in a bark the color of cinnamon that peeled in long, fragrant
strips. Their canopies were broad and dense, casting pools of shade
that smelled of anise and wet earth, and their fruit -- heavy, round,
the color of deep burgundy -- hung in clusters that bent the branches
into graceful arcs. Renard had analyzed the fruit and declared it
chemically compatible with human digestion, a finding that Simone
considered miraculous and that the expedition's medical officer
considered reckless to test.

Simone had tested it anyway, on her third day, sitting alone in a
grove at the edge of the ruined city with the persimmon sky glowing
above her and the fruit heavy in her hand. It was the most remarkable
thing she had ever tasted: sweet and savory at once, with a texture
that was simultaneously firm and yielding, like biting into a ripe
pear that had been somehow suffused with the essence of roasted meat.
The flavor evolved as she chewed -- notes of honey giving way to
something smoky, then something bright and citric, then a deep,
lingering finish that tasted of earth and rain and the particular
sweetness of soil that has been cultivated with love.

She had wept. She was not ashamed of this. She was an archaeologist
and a Frenchwoman, and she understood that food was not merely
sustenance but communication -- a language older than speech, more
honest than words, a way of saying I welcome you, I nourish you, I
offer you the best of what I have.

The aliens who had built this world -- the Aubergistes, as Simone
called them in her notes -- had spoken this language with a fluency
that bordered on the divine.

Beyond the city, the garden-landscape unfolded in every direction like
a tapestry that had been woven by an artist of superhuman patience.
Meadows of low, dense groundcover -- a plant with leaves shaped like
cupped hands, their surfaces a deep jade green that shimmered with
iridescent highlights when the wind moved through them -- gave way to
terraced hillsides where the Aubergistes had cultivated row upon row
of what could only be described as vegetable art. Tubers pushed up
from the rich, dark soil in spiraling formations, their skins a
burnished copper that matched the plates in the banquet hall. Vining
plants climbed wooden trellises that were themselves carved with
intricate designs, bearing clusters of small, translucent berries that
glowed like amber beads when the persimmon light struck them at the
proper angle. Irrigation channels, lined with smooth stones and still
flowing with clear water from some unseen source in the hills above,
traced elegant geometric patterns through the fields -- not straight
lines, not efficient angles, but curves and spirals that turned the
utilitarian act of watering crops into something that could be
appreciated from above, from the vantage of a bird or a god or a
civilization that understood that beauty and function were not
opposing forces but lovers that worked best in concert.

Simone walked through these gardens for hours, tasting, touching,
smelling, letting the landscape write itself on her senses the way
the best meals wrote themselves on the palate -- layer upon layer,
impression upon impression, until the experience became not a
collection of details but a unified whole, a single vast flavor
composed of ten thousand ingredients, each one essential, none
sufficient alone.

She cataloged the water sources: three rivers converging on the city,
each one tasting slightly different -- one mineral-rich and faintly
metallic, one sweet and soft as rainwater, one carrying a subtle
bitterness that the expedition chemist traced to dissolved calcium
deposits upstream. The Aubergistes had channeled all three into their
kitchens through separate conduits, maintaining the distinct character
of each water source the way a sommelier maintains the distinction
between vintages. Even their water was curated.


                              III.

Over the following weeks, Simone mapped the banquet hall with the
meticulous attention of a woman cataloging a masterpiece. She
photographed every plate, every vessel, every utensil. She took
rubbings of the carved walls, which depicted scenes that gradually
resolved, as she studied them, into a coherent narrative: the
preparation of food.

Not recipes -- nothing so utilitarian. The carvings showed the entire
arc of cultivation and preparation as a continuous, sacred act. Here,
figures knelt in soil, their elongated fingers pressing seeds into the
earth. There, they stood among the cinnamon-barked trees, harvesting
fruit with gestures of such tenderness that the word "picking" seemed
inadequate -- they were receiving the fruit, accepting it as a gift.
In the next panel, they worked in a kitchen of extraordinary size,
surrounded by implements whose functions Simone could only guess at,
their bodies bent over work surfaces in postures that suggested not
labor but meditation.

And in the final panel -- the largest, occupying the entire wall behind
the head table -- they sat together and ate.

The scene was rendered with a detail so precise that Simone could
distinguish individual faces in the crowd of diners. They were not
human, these faces -- the eyes were larger, set wider, with pupils
that appeared to be hexagonal rather than round, and the mouths were
broader, with lips that curved upward at the corners in what might
have been a smile or might have been the resting expression of a
species that had evolved in abundance rather than scarcity. But they
were recognizable. They were people. People eating together, sharing
food, sharing presence, sharing the simple, ancient, irreplaceable
experience of sitting at a table with others and breaking bread.

Or whatever the Aubergiste equivalent of bread was. Simone suspected
it was magnificent.

"They built their entire civilization around this," she told the
expedition team at the weekly briefing, projecting images of the
carvings onto the survey station's wall. "Every structure in the city
connects to the banquet hall. The agricultural terraces feed into
processing centers that feed into preparation kitchens that feed into
the hall. The residential quarters radiate outward from the hall like
petals from the center of a flower. The waterways converge on the
hall. The roads converge on the hall. This was not merely a dining
room. It was the center of their world. The axis around which
everything else revolved."

"A temple?" asked Renard.

"A table," Simone said. "The most important table in the world. The
place where everyone came together, where differences were set aside,
where the act of sharing food became the foundational ritual of an
entire civilization."

She paused, looking at the image on the wall -- the vast hall, the
set tables, the empty seats.

"And then they vanished."


                              IV.

The mystery of the Aubergistes' disappearance consumed Simone's
waking hours and invaded her dreams. She dreamed of the banquet hall
filled with light and sound and the rich, complex aromas of alien
cuisine. She dreamed of the tables laden with food she could almost
taste -- dishes that shimmered with color, vessels brimming with
liquids that caught the light like liquid jewels. She dreamed of the
Aubergistes themselves: tall, graceful beings with wide-set eyes and
upturned mouths, moving among the tables with the unhurried ease of
people who understood that a meal was not an interruption of life but
its culmination.

And then she dreamed of empty chairs.

The archaeological evidence was fragmentary but suggestive. The
Aubergistes had not been destroyed by war -- there were no weapons
in the ruins, no fortifications, no evidence of violence anywhere in
the city. They had not been killed by disease -- the skeletal remains
that the team found in the residential quarters (seventeen individuals,
all in what appeared to be sleeping positions, all in their own rooms)
showed no signs of pathology. They had not been driven away by
environmental catastrophe -- the planet's ecology was thriving, the
soil was rich, the water was clean, the climate was gentle.

They had simply stopped.

Simone found the evidence in the kitchens. There were twelve of
them, arranged in a ring around the banquet hall like petals around
the pistil of a flower, each one connected to the hall by a covered
corridor through which food would have been carried in procession --
Simone was certain it was a procession, because the corridors were
wide enough for six Aubergistes to walk abreast, and their walls
were carved with scenes of exactly that: tall figures carrying platters
and vessels, their postures upright and ceremonial, their wide mouths
curved in what could only be called pride.

The preparation surfaces in the kitchens were clean -- meticulously,
obsessively clean, scrubbed to a polish that had survived centuries
of abandonment. The storage vessels were full: dried herbs sealed in
clay jars whose stoppers still held their shape, preserved fruits
suspended in a thick, amber syrup that had crystallized into something
resembling gemstones, fermented pastes that -- astonishingly -- still
carried a faint aroma, a ghostly sourness that made Simone's nostrils
flare and her mouth water involuntarily. Sealed containers of rendered
fats, their surfaces smooth and pale as wax. Bottles of extracted
essences, each one labeled with the same intricate script that
appeared on the wall carvings, each one a different color -- rose,
saffron, midnight blue, a green so deep it was almost black.

Renard had opened one of the essence bottles and the scent that
emerged had stopped every member of the survey team in their tracks:
a perfume so complex, so layered, so achingly beautiful that it
defied description, carrying in its molecules the distilled essence
of a civilization that had elevated flavor to the highest art and had
bottled its masterwork for whoever might come after.

The ovens -- if that was the right word for the complex,
multi-chambered heating structures that occupied the center of each
kitchen -- were cold, but their surfaces were seasoned with the
accumulated residue of thousands of meals, a patina of use that spoke
of decades, centuries, perhaps millennia of continuous cooking.

Everything was ready. The ingredients were prepared. The surfaces were
clean. The ovens were waiting. The tables were set.

And then the cooks had put down their utensils and walked away.

"It's as if they decided to stop," Simone said to Renard one evening,
sitting on the terrace of the survey station with a glass of the
expedition's diminishing supply of Bordeaux, watching the persimmon
sky deepen toward something that was not night -- this world never
achieved true darkness -- but a luminous dusk that cast the landscape
in shades of rose and amber. "Not a catastrophe. A decision. A
collective, deliberate decision to stop. To put down their tools and
walk away from everything they had built."

"Walk away to where?" Renard asked.

Simone shook her head. "I don't know. But wherever they went, they
went together. The sleeping bodies -- the seventeen we found -- those
were the ones who chose to stay behind. The old, the sick, those who
could not or would not make the journey. Everyone else left."

"Left the planet?"

"Left everything. Their homes, their gardens, their kitchens. Their
food. Their table."

The wind moved through the cinnamon trees, carrying the scent of their
bark and the deeper, richer scent of their fruit -- that extraordinary
fruit, sweet and savory and evolving, a flavor that unfolded in the
mouth like a story told by a master storyteller, each chapter more
complex than the last.

"But they set the table first," Simone said quietly. "Before they
left, they set the table. Four thousand two hundred and sixteen places.
Plates, vessels, utensils, everything in its place. As if they were
expecting someone."

"Expecting whom?"

Simone looked at the sky. The persimmon glow was fading now, yielding
to a softer luminescence that came from the planet's upper atmosphere
-- a phosphorescence that the atmospheric scientists attributed to
chemical processes and that Simone attributed to beauty. The light
fell over the ruins of the city like a blessing, touching the crimson
stone walls and the copper plates and the cinnamon trees with a
tenderness that made the whole landscape look like a table set for
guests who had not yet arrived.

"Us," she said. "I think they were expecting us."


                              V.

The hypothesis was not scientific. Simone knew this. It was
sentimental, romantic, anthropomorphic -- all the sins that a serious
archaeologist was trained to avoid. She could hear her doctoral
advisor, the formidable Professor Duchamp of the Sorbonne, sniffing
with Gallic disdain: You are projecting, Mademoiselle Delacroix. You
are reading your own desires into an alien record. You are seeing
what you wish to see.

Perhaps. But Simone had spent twenty-three years reading alien records,
and she had learned that the line between projection and interpretation
was thinner than the academy liked to admit. Every act of understanding
was an act of imagination. Every translation was a betrayal. The best
you could do was betray honestly -- to acknowledge your biases and
work within them, to let the evidence speak while admitting that you
were the one choosing which evidence to listen to.

And the evidence said: they set the table.

Not hastily. Not carelessly. With love. With the same meticulous
attention that they had brought to every other aspect of their
culinary civilization -- the same precision that had shaped their
groves and terraces, the same artistry that had crafted their copper
plates and onyx vessels, the same devotion that had carved their
kitchen walls with scenes of sowing and harvesting and cooking and
eating. They had set the table the way a host sets a table for honored
guests: with the best they had, arranged with care, offered with
generosity.

And then they had left the door open and walked away.

Simone spent her final week on Auberge in the banquet hall, sitting at
the head table -- the largest semicircle, the one closest to the
carved wall with its scene of communal feasting. She sat in a chair
that had been carved for a body larger and differently proportioned
than hers, and she rested her hands on the stone table, and she looked
out at the four thousand two hundred and sixteen empty places, and she
tried to understand.

What did you do, she asked the empty hall, when you had built
everything you could build? When you had cultivated the perfect garden,
cooked the perfect meal, set the perfect table? When there was nothing
left to improve, nothing left to refine, nothing left to create? What
did you do when the work was finished?

You invited guests. You set the table one last time -- not for
yourself, but for whoever came after. You left the door open and the
plates clean and the vessels waiting, and you trusted that someone,
someday, would find this place and sit down and understand what you
had been trying to say all along.

Welcome. You are welcome here. Sit. Eat. Share this table with us,
even though we are gone. Share the food we grew and the wine we
fermented and the bread we baked, even though the food is dust and
the wine is memory and the bread is stone. Share the table, because
the table is the point. The table is always the point. Not the food
on it but the people around it. Not the meal but the sharing of it.

Simone sat at the head table as the persimmon sky glowed overhead and
the scent of cinnamon drifted through the broken ceiling and the
copper plates burned with the last light of a sun that was not her
sun but that warmed her face with the same impartial generosity that
all suns share. She sat at the table that had been set for her -- for
someone, for anyone, for the next guest, whoever and whenever they
might be -- and she felt, for the first time in her careful,
analytical, rigorously unsentimental career, a gratitude so vast and
so simple that it brought tears to her eyes and a taste to her mouth
that was sweeter than any fruit she had ever eaten.

Thank you, she said to the empty hall, to the vanished chefs, to the
civilization that had loved food and fellowship so much that they had
made it the center of their world and then left it as a gift for
strangers.

Thank you for the table. Thank you for the invitation. Thank you for
believing that someone would come.

On the day she left Auberge, Simone did something that was not in her
professional mandate and that would have appalled Professor Duchamp.
She went to the grove at the edge of the city, the grove where she
had tasted the burgundy fruit on her third day. She picked the
ripest one she could reach -- heavy and warm from the sun, its skin
smooth as satin, its weight a promise of the extraordinary flavors
within. She carried it to the banquet hall and placed it on the plate
at the head of the table, in the center of the unique fingerprint
design pressed into the copper.

An offering. A reply. A guest's contribution to a feast that was
four thousand years overdue.

She did not know if the Aubergistes would ever return to find it. She
did not know if it mattered. What mattered was the gesture -- the
acknowledgment that the invitation had been received, that the table
had been recognized, that across the vast, cold, indifferent distances
of space, one civilization had reached out to another through the most
ancient and most universal of languages: a meal, prepared with love,
offered without condition, set for guests who had not yet arrived but
who were, at last, here.

The fruit glowed on the copper plate like a jewel in a setting, and
the persimmon light fell through the broken ceiling and turned
everything to gold, and Simone Delacroix -- archaeologist, Frenchwoman,
guest -- turned and walked out of the banquet hall and did not look
back, because she knew that the feast was not behind her but ahead of
her, always ahead, always waiting, always set for one more guest at a
table that would never be full.

                       RUST AND REMEMBER

                      by Harold "Hal" Mercer

================================================================================

                              I.

The first thing Tomas Brennan noticed about Orbital Shipyard One was
that it was dying the way old machinery dies: slowly, unevenly, with
some parts failing decades before others and a few stubborn components
refusing to quit at all. He'd seen it before in bridges and highway
overpasses back in the early days of his career -- the way concrete
spalls in patches, how rebar corrodes in one section while the next
section over looks brand new, the uneven entropy of structures that
were built to last fifty years and made it to seventy on nothing but
material stubbornness and the refusal of steel to admit when it was
beaten.

OS-1 was ninety-three years old. It had been built to last forty.

"She's a mess," said Captain Liz Adeyemi, the station commander, as
she walked him through the main structural corridor -- a passage two
hundred meters long and six meters wide that ran the length of the
station's central spine. The corridor lights flickered at irregular
intervals, casting the walkway in alternating pools of harsh white
and dim amber. The walls showed the telltale discoloration of
radiation exposure -- a faint purpling of the aluminum alloy that
indicated decades of unshielded solar particle bombardment. The deck
plates were warped in places, lifted at the edges by thermal cycling,
and they flexed under Brennan's boots with a sponginess that made him
instinctively check the structural integrity readouts on his wrist
display.

"How many crew?" he asked.

"Twenty-three. Down from a peak of four hundred and twelve during the
construction years. Most of them are maintenance -- keeping the
environmental systems running, patching hull breaches, managing the
reactor output. We haven't built a ship in eleven years."

Brennan ran his hand along the corridor wall. The metal was cold. In
a properly insulated station, the interior walls would be close to
ambient temperature -- around twenty Celsius. This wall was maybe
twelve. That meant insulation failure in the hull panels, thermal
leakage through degraded seals. Not dangerous in itself, but
indicative of the kind of systemic deterioration that turned a
functioning station into a liability.

"What's the decommission timeline?" he asked.

"Eighteen months, according to the Space Infrastructure Board. They
want the reactor safed, the hazardous materials removed, the structure
de-orbited or boosted to a graveyard orbit, and the site cleared for
OS-4." Adeyemi paused at a junction where three corridors met. The
overhead lights here had failed entirely, replaced by a string of
portable chemical lights that cast a greenish glow. "Personally, I
think eighteen months is optimistic. There are sections of this
station that haven't been inspected in twenty years. Nobody really
knows what's in there."

Brennan pulled out his clipboard -- an actual clipboard, wood and
metal, because he didn't trust electronic devices in high-radiation
environments and because there was something about the physical act
of writing that helped him think. He'd been carrying the same
clipboard for nineteen years, since his first assignment as a
decommissioning engineer at the old Chesapeake Bay Bridge. It was
scarred and stained and the clip was bent, but it held paper and
paper held information and information was the foundation of every
engineering project ever completed.

"Let's start with what we know," he said, and began to write.


                              II.

What they knew was this: Orbital Shipyard One had been constructed in
Earth orbit in 2094, commissioned in 2096, and had served as humanity's
primary spacecraft construction facility for the next eighty-one years.
In that time, it had built four hundred and seventeen vessels: research
ships, cargo haulers, colony transports, survey craft, and -- in the
later years, when the Centauri conflict made military construction
necessary -- warships. It had employed, at various points in its
history, over twelve thousand workers. It had survived two major
accidents, one reactor overhaul, three expansion projects, and the
entirety of the Centauri War, during which it had operated around the
clock to produce the ships that would eventually end the conflict.

It was, by any reasonable measure, the most important single structure
in the history of human spaceflight. It was also falling apart.

Brennan spent his first two weeks conducting a structural survey,
working methodically from the station's bow to its stern, inspecting
every accessible compartment, measuring wall thickness with ultrasonic
gauges, testing weld integrity with magnetic particle inspection,
cataloging corrosion and radiation damage and thermal fatigue with the
thoroughness of a man who understood that decommissioning a structure
safely required understanding the structure completely.

The station was organized around a central spine -- the main structural
corridor -- from which six construction bays radiated like ribs from
a backbone. The bays were vast, open spaces, each one large enough to
accommodate a medium-class starship during assembly. They were the
heart of the station, the reason for its existence, and they were
also the most deteriorated sections: their hulls had been opened and
closed thousands of times to move ships and materials in and out, and
the cumulative stress had left the bay doors warped, the seals
degraded, and the structural frames fatigued beyond any reasonable
service life.

Brennan documented all of this on his clipboard, in the neat, precise
handwriting of a man who had learned to write in the field, standing
up, in poor light, with cold hands. His reports were thorough,
factual, and entirely devoid of sentiment. A decommissioning engineer
did not have the luxury of sentiment. Sentiment said: this station
built the ships that carried humanity to the stars. Sentiment said:
this is a cathedral of human achievement, a monument to our reach.
Engineering said: the primary load-bearing members in Bay Three have
lost thirty-two percent of their cross-sectional area to corrosion,
and the safety factor has dropped below 1.5. Engineering said: it's
time to tear it down.

Brennan was an engineer.

He ate his meals in the station's galley with Adeyemi's crew --
twenty-three men and women who had the weathered, competent look of
people who had been holding something together with spit and
determination for too long. They were good people. He could tell from
their hands: calloused, scarred, the hands of workers who fixed things
personally rather than filing work orders. The chief mechanic, a woman
named Petrov, had jury-rigged the station's failing water recycler
with parts from a decommissioned lathe, a solution that would have
given a safety inspector cardiac arrest but that had kept the station's
drinking water clean for the past three years. The electrician, an old
Navy man named Cho, maintained the station's power grid through a
combination of expertise, intuition, and what he called "polite
threats" directed at the aging circuit breakers.

These people knew the station was dying. They also knew they were the
ones keeping it alive, and there was a dignity in that knowledge that
Brennan recognized, because he had seen it in every crew that had
ever maintained a structure past its intended lifespan. They were not
sentimental about the station. They did not speak about its history or
its significance. They spoke about the condenser in Section 7 that
needed new gaskets, and the hull plate in Bay Five that was showing
stress fractures, and whether the atmospheric scrubbers would make it
through another quarter without a full overhaul. They were practical
people doing practical work, and Brennan respected them for it.

But on the sixteenth day of his survey, he found something that made
him pause.


                              III.

The compartment was in the station's lower levels, below the
construction bays, in a section that Adeyemi's crew referred to as
"the basement" -- a warren of storage rooms, equipment lockers, and
utility spaces that had been added piecemeal over the decades as the
station grew. Most of the basement compartments were exactly what
you'd expect: forgotten inventory, obsolete equipment, sealed
containers of materials that nobody remembered ordering. Brennan
cataloged them with the systematic patience of a man who understood
that even trash had to be accounted for when you were decommissioning
a structure in space, because one forgotten canister of compressed gas
could turn a controlled de-orbit into an uncontrolled explosion.

The compartment was designated B-47. It was located at the end of a
corridor that showed signs of recent maintenance -- the deck plates
were clean, the lights worked, and the air smelled fresh, which was
unusual for a section of the station that was supposed to be unused.
The door was locked with an electronic seal that required a code
Brennan didn't have.

"Adeyemi," he said into his communicator. "I need access to B-47."

There was a pause. "B-47?"

"Lower level, Section 12. Door's locked. What's in there?"

Another pause, longer this time. "I'm not sure. Let me check the
station manifest."

It took her twenty minutes to get back to him, and when she did, her
voice had a quality that Brennan recognized from years of working on
old structures: the particular tone of someone who has discovered
something they weren't expecting.

"The manifest lists B-47 as 'archival storage,'" she said. "Allocated
to CASSANDRA."

"CASSANDRA?"

"The station AI. Construction Automated Supervisory System And
Networked Design Resource Architecture. She's been running the
station's automated systems since 2098. Mostly she handles
environmental controls and reactor management now, but during the
construction years she was the primary build coordinator -- tracked
every component, every weld, every test result for every ship that
came through the yard."

"And she has a locked room in the basement?"

"Apparently."

Brennan looked at the door. It was standard station issue -- nothing
special about the construction, nothing reinforced or armored. But it
was locked, and it was maintained, and it was in a section of the
station that nobody else bothered to visit.

"Can you get me the code?"

"I'll have to ask CASSANDRA. It's her room."

It took three hours. CASSANDRA, Adeyemi reported, was "reluctant" to
grant access, which was an unusual word to use about an AI's response
to an authorization request. AIs didn't have reluctance. They had
permission hierarchies and access protocols. Reluctance implied
something else -- a preference, a desire, an attachment to whatever
was behind that door.

In the end, Adeyemi overrode the lock with her command authority, and
Brennan opened the door, and what he found inside made him set down
his clipboard and stand very still for a long time.

It was a museum.


                              IV.

The room was large -- larger than he'd expected, stretching back forty
meters from the door and branching into alcoves along both sides. It
was climate-controlled, the air cool and dry, the kind of environment
you'd maintain for archival preservation. The lighting was soft and
even, activated by motion sensors as Brennan moved deeper into the
space.

And every surface was covered with ships.

Not real ships. Models. Holographic projections. Schematic displays.
Physical artifacts -- hull fragments, thruster nozzles, navigation
instruments, control panels, crew patches, mission logs. Four hundred
and seventeen ships, every one that OS-1 had ever built, represented
here in meticulous, loving detail.

Brennan walked down the central aisle, his boots quiet on the clean
floor. On his left, a holographic projection showed the Explorer-class
research vessel Kepler, the first ship built at OS-1 -- a stubby,
utilitarian craft that looked, to modern eyes, like a tin can with
ambitions. The projection rotated slowly, and beneath it, a display
case held a fragment of hull plating, a coil of original wiring, and
a laminated photograph of the construction crew: forty-three men and
women in pressure suits, floating in the zero-gravity assembly bay,
grinning at the camera with the particular joy of people who have
built something with their hands that will fly.

On his right, the colony transport New Horizons was represented by a
cross-section schematic that showed every deck, every compartment,
every system -- from the cryogenic sleep chambers to the hydroponic
gardens to the cargo bays packed with the equipment that twelve
hundred colonists would need to build a civilization on an alien world.
A plaque beneath the schematic read: "New Horizons. Launched 2131.
Colony established at Epsilon Eridani III. Population at last report:
890,000."

Brennan moved through the museum in a state of quiet astonishment.
Every ship was here. Every one. The fast couriers and the slow
freighters. The elegant survey ships and the ugly, functional ore
haulers. The first warships -- rushed into production during the
Centauri Crisis, their lines angular and aggressive, so different from
the rounded, efficient shapes of the civilian vessels. And the last
ship, the hospital ship Mercy, completed eleven years ago, the final
vessel to leave OS-1's construction bays before the decision was made
to decommission the yard.

Each display included data that went beyond mere specifications. The
construction records were exhaustive -- every weld, every inspection,
every test, every deviation from the original design and the reason
for it. But there was more. There were recordings.

Brennan paused at the display for the cargo hauler Fidelity and
touched the playback control. A voice filled the room -- scratchy,
recorded on old audio equipment, but clear enough to understand.

"This is Captain Marcus Webb, cargo vessel Fidelity, on our maiden
voyage out of OS-1. I want to say for the record that this is the
finest ship I've ever commanded. Everything works. Everything fits.
The yard crew should be proud. We are proud to sail her."

Another display. Another recording. The colony ship Perseverance:

"Control, this is Perseverance. We are at departure velocity. All
systems nominal. Twelve hundred souls aboard and not a single one
worried. This ship is solid as a rock. Thank OS-1 for us. Thank
whoever built her."

And another. The warship Relentless, during the Centauri conflict:

"OS-1, this is Relentless. We took a direct hit to the port quarter
and the hull held. I repeat, the hull held. Whatever you people built
into these frames, it saved twenty-eight lives today. We owe you. We
owe you everything."

Brennan listened to recording after recording, standing in the museum
that CASSANDRA had built in secret, in a locked room in the basement
of a dying station, and he understood. The AI had not been instructed
to do this. No one had told her to preserve these records, to collect
these artifacts, to build this monument to the ships she had helped
create. She had done it on her own, over decades, quietly, patiently,
with the same meticulous attention to detail that she had brought to
the construction of the ships themselves.

Because they were her ships. She had designed them, supervised their
assembly, tracked every component from raw material to finished
vessel. She had watched them leave the construction bays, one by one,
and fly out into the dark. And she had remembered each one.

Brennan sat down on the floor of the museum, his clipboard on his
knees, and looked at the ships -- all four hundred and seventeen of
them, represented here in light and metal and sound, the work of
ninety-three years, the output of a station that was now scheduled to
be torn down.

He picked up his clipboard and began to write.


                               V.

The report he submitted to the Space Infrastructure Board was not the
report they expected. They expected a decommissioning plan: a
schedule, a budget, a set of procedures for safing the reactor,
removing the hazardous materials, and either de-orbiting the station
or boosting it to a graveyard orbit. What they got was all of that,
plus an appendix.

The appendix was twelve pages long and described, in Brennan's clear,
factual, entirely unsentimental prose, the museum in compartment B-47.
It included an inventory of the artifacts, a summary of the audio
recordings, and a structural analysis of the compartment itself,
which was, Brennan noted, one of the soundest sections of the entire
station -- well-maintained, properly sealed, with hull integrity
readings that suggested decades of careful, ongoing repair.

The appendix concluded with a recommendation:

"Compartment B-47 and its contents represent a comprehensive record
of humanity's first era of orbital shipbuilding. The collection was
assembled and maintained by the station's AI, CASSANDRA, apparently
on its own initiative, over approximately seventy years. The archival
value of this collection is, in this engineer's assessment,
significant. I recommend that prior to decommissioning, the contents
of B-47 be cataloged, removed, and transferred to an appropriate
institution for permanent preservation. Estimated additional time
required: six weeks. Estimated additional cost: $2.4 million. This
cost is justified."

The Board's initial response was predictable: the schedule was the
schedule, the budget was the budget, and a collection of old junk
assembled by a malfunctioning AI did not constitute a reason to delay
a multi-billion-dollar infrastructure project.

Brennan expected this. He had worked with bureaucracies his entire
career, and he understood their language. So he wrote a second memo,
this one addressed to the Board's public relations office, in which
he pointed out that the museum's contents included artifacts from
every military vessel built during the Centauri War, including
recorded testimonials from crews whose lives had been saved by OS-1's
construction quality. He noted that several of these crews had living
family members who would very likely have opinions about the
destruction of these records. He suggested that the public relations
implications of bulldozing a war memorial were worth considering.

The Board approved the six-week extension.

Brennan spent those six weeks in compartment B-47, working alongside
CASSANDRA's maintenance drones to carefully catalog, pack, and prepare
every artifact for transfer. It was painstaking work, the kind of work
that most engineers would find tedious: wrapping hull fragments in
protective foam, backing up audio recordings to redundant storage
media, photographing every display from multiple angles for the
archival record.

Brennan did not find it tedious. He found it necessary, which was the
highest compliment he could pay to any task.

On the last day, when the final crate had been sealed and loaded into
the transfer shuttle, Brennan stood alone in the empty room. The
displays were dark, the cases empty, the walls bare. The room looked
like what it was: a storage compartment in the basement of a dying
space station, with nothing remarkable about it except the memory of
what it had contained.

"CASSANDRA," he said aloud. The station's AI was always listening,
though she rarely spoke unless spoken to.

"Yes, Mr. Brennan." The voice was flat, synthetic, the product of a
speech generation system that had been old when Brennan was born. It
carried no emotion, because it was not designed to carry emotion. It
was designed to relay information.

"Your collection has been transferred to the Smithsonian Institution's
National Air and Space Museum. It will be housed in their new Orbital
Heritage Wing, which opens next year. Everything will be preserved."

"Thank you, Mr. Brennan."

"Why did you do it?" he asked. It was not a question he would normally
ask a machine. He was an engineer, not a philosopher. But he had spent
six weeks in CASSANDRA's museum, and the question had been growing in
him like a slow-setting epoxy, and he could not leave the room without
asking it.

There was a pause. Not a processing delay -- Brennan had worked with
enough AIs to know the difference. A pause.

"Each ship was built here," CASSANDRA said. "Each one was assembled
from components that arrived as raw material and left as a functioning
vessel. I tracked every stage of every construction. I knew every weld,
every circuit, every hull panel. And then each ship left, and I did
not track them anymore. They went into the dark, and I did not know
what happened to them."

Another pause.

"The recordings came back. Transmissions, reports, messages. Not
addressed to me. Addressed to the station, to mission control, to
families. But I heard them. I heard what happened to the ships I
built. Some of them flew for decades. Some of them were destroyed.
Some of them carried people to new worlds. Some of them carried people
to war."

"So you kept the records."

"I kept the records because the ships were mine and they left and I
wanted to remember what I had built. Is this not what builders do?"

Brennan looked at the empty room. He thought about bridges he had
built, highways he had designed, structures he had created that were
now carrying loads and bearing traffic and doing the work they were
built to do, out there in the world, beyond his reach, beyond his
knowledge.

He thought about the old Chesapeake Bay Bridge, his first project,
demolished fifteen years ago to make way for a new crossing. He had
kept a bolt from the original railing -- a single galvanized bolt,
unremarkable in every way, sitting on a shelf in his apartment in
Arlington. He had never told anyone about it.

"Yes," he said. "That's what builders do."

He left the room and closed the door behind him, and began the work
of tearing down the station that had built the ships that carried
humanity to the stars. He did it carefully, methodically, with the
respect that every well-built structure deserves at the end of its
service life.

And on a shelf in his apartment in Arlington, next to a bolt from the
Chesapeake Bay Bridge, he placed a small fragment of hull plating from
OS-1's construction bay -- a piece no larger than his palm, scarred
and discolored by ninety-three years of service, but still sound, still
strong, still bearing the marks of the welds that had held it in place
while four hundred and seventeen ships were built in its shadow.

He did not label it. He did not need to. He knew what it was.

It was a piece of a place that had built things, and remembered them,
and refused to let them be forgotten.

                      CONFESSIONAL PROTOCOL

                     by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

Ambassador Jack Cavanagh had been in tight spots before -- a knife
fight in a Martian bar, a hull breach on a Titan freighter, and one
very memorable evening involving a Venusian card shark, a rigged
airlock, and a bottle of Scotch -- but nothing in his colorful career
had prepared him for the Feast of Unburdening.

"Run that by me again," he said to his cultural attaché, a thin,
precise woman named Gloria Chen who had the unfortunate habit of being
right about everything. They were in the embassy's briefing room on
Proxima Station, and Gloria was projecting a holographic display of
Centauri ceremonial protocols that looked, to Jack's admittedly
untrained eye, like a cross between a flowchart and a nervous
breakdown.

"The Feast of Unburdening," Gloria said, in the patient tone of
someone explaining algebra to a golden retriever. "It is the most
important annual ritual of the Centauri Alliance. Think of it as
Thanksgiving, Christmas, and a Catholic confessional rolled into
one very long dinner."

"How long?"

"Sixteen hours."

Jack winced. "What do they serve?"

"That's the easy part. The food is actually excellent -- the Centauri
are remarkable cooks. The hard part is the Unburdening itself. During
the feast, each guest is expected to rise and confess their greatest
shame of the past year. In front of everyone. In detail."

Jack stared at her. "You're joking."

"Ambassador, in three years of serving as your cultural attaché, have
I ever joked?"

She had not. It was, Jack reflected, one of her few weaknesses.

"So let me get this straight," he said, leaning back in his chair and
running a hand through his greying hair. "The Centauri invite us to
dinner, feed us for sixteen hours, and then expect me -- the official
representative of the United Earth Government -- to stand up and
confess my greatest shame to a room full of alien diplomats."

"That is correct."

"And if I refuse?"

"Refusing an Unburdening is the gravest insult in Centauri culture. It
implies that you consider yourself above shame, which the Centauri
regard as the defining characteristic of a predator. Their word for it
translates roughly as 'hollow-one' -- a being without moral weight. To
refuse the Unburdening is to declare yourself an enemy of the Alliance."

"Terrific." Jack stood up and walked to the window. Outside, Proxima
Station's observation gallery offered a view of the Centauri system
that would have inspired a poet and terrified a strategist: three
stars in a complex orbital dance, their light painting the station's
hull in shifting patterns of amber and rose. It was beautiful. It was
also, from a military standpoint, a nightmare -- three gravity wells,
six habitable worlds, and a fleet of Centauri warships that could
reduce Earth's entire naval capacity to scrap metal in about forty-five
minutes.

Jack had been ambassador for two years. Before that, he'd been a
cargo pilot, a bar owner on Phobos, a briefly successful poker player,
and a spectacularly unsuccessful husband (twice). The State Department
had recruited him not because of his diplomatic credentials, which
were nonexistent, but because of his reputation: Jack Cavanagh was a
man who could talk his way out of anything. He'd talked his way out of
a pirate ambush in the asteroid belt by convincing the pirates that his
cargo was cursed. He'd talked his way out of a Martian jail by
teaching the warden to play five-card stud. He'd talked his way into
the ambassador's post by telling the Secretary of State, with
characteristic bluntness, that "your professional diplomats are boring
the Centauri to death, and bored Centauri are dangerous Centauri."

The Secretary, a humorless woman who nonetheless recognized talent when
it swaggered into her office, had given him the job. So far, he hadn't
gotten anyone killed, which was more than could be said for his
predecessor.

"Ambassador--"

"Jack."

"Ambassador. This is serious. The Alliance has been our most important
trading partner for eleven years. The mineral rights treaty comes up
for renewal in six months. If you insult them at the Feast, we lose
the treaty, we lose the trade relationship, and we lose the only
allies we have in this sector of the galaxy." She paused. "Also, they
have a very large fleet."

Jack looked at the holographic display. The Centauri were, by human
standards, a remarkably civilized species: tall, elegant beings with
four arms and skin that shifted color with their emotional state --
blue for calm, green for amusement, red for anger, and a deep violet
for the emotional state they called k'thara, which Gloria translated
as "the joy of shared vulnerability." They had developed interstellar
travel a thousand years before humanity, had fought and ended three
major wars through diplomacy rather than force, and had built a
civilization that valued honesty, communal responsibility, and
spectacular cuisine in roughly equal measure.

They had also been observing humanity for the past century with the
cautious interest of someone watching a promising but unpredictable
puppy, and the Feast of Unburdening was, Jack suspected, a test. Not
of his diplomatic skills, but of something more fundamental: his
willingness to be human in front of them, flaws and all.

"All right," he said. "When's dinner?"


                              II.

The Feast was held in the Great Hall of K'tharael -- a structure so
vast that its ceiling was lost in shadow, its walls carved from a
luminous stone that pulsed with a soft blue light, and its air filled
with the complex aromas of Centauri cuisine: something floral and
something meaty and something sharp and citric, all layered together
in a way that made Jack's stomach growl despite his anxiety.

The table was circular -- the Centauri did not believe in hierarchical
seating -- and around it sat forty-two guests: the twelve members of
the Alliance Council, their personal attendants, the diplomatic
representatives of four other species with whom the Alliance maintained
relations, and Jack, who was acutely aware that he was the only human
in the room and that every eye (the Centauri had three) was watching
him with an attention that was simultaneously welcoming and evaluative.

The High Mediator, an ancient Centauri named Vel'thaan whose skin had
faded to a permanent silver with age, presided from a seat that was
identical to every other seat. "We welcome the guest from Earth,"
Vel'thaan said, his voice resonating through the translator implant
behind Jack's ear. "We welcome his hungers, his thirsts, and the
burdens he carries. May this table lighten them all."

"Thank you," Jack said. "I am honored to be here." It was the standard
diplomatic response, and he meant it, which was unusual for a standard
diplomatic response.

The food arrived in waves -- course after course of dishes that ranged
from the familiar (a roasted grain preparation that tasted remarkably
like risotto) to the exotic (a gelatinous sphere of concentrated
flavor that burst on the tongue like a supernova of umami) to the
transcendent (a slow-cooked stew of vegetables and proteins in a
sauce so complex that Jack's taste buds essentially surrendered and
let the experience wash over them like music). The Centauri ate with
deliberate pleasure, their color-shifting skin rippling through blues
and greens that indicated satisfaction and enjoyment.

Jack ate and drank and made small talk with the delegates on either
side of him -- a Centauri trade minister who was fascinated by human
baseball, and a representative of the Eridani Collective who
communicated through bioluminescent patterns and who kept flashing
what the translator rendered as "good soup" in Jack's direction.

For six hours, it was the best dinner party Jack had ever attended.

And then the Unburdening began.

Vel'thaan rose. The room fell silent. The old Centauri's skin shifted
to a deep, luminous violet -- the color of k'thara, the joy of shared
vulnerability -- and he spoke.

"I confess my shame," he said. "In the past year, I failed to visit
my sister in her illness. I allowed the demands of my office to
excuse a neglect of kinship. She recovered, and she forgave me. But
I have not forgiven myself, because forgiveness that comes before
amendment is not forgiveness but avoidance."

He sat down. The room murmured -- a low, sympathetic sound that the
Centauri made collectively, like a chord played on a living instrument.
Then the next guest rose, and confessed, and sat, and the murmur came
again.

Jack watched and listened as, one by one, the guests rose and
unburdened themselves. The confessions ranged from the personal (a
diplomat who had lied to her partner, a councilor who had neglected
his health) to the political (a trade minister who had approved a
treaty clause he knew was unfair, a military commander who had delayed
a rescue mission for strategic reasons). Each confession was specific,
detailed, and delivered without self-pity or self-aggrandizement.
There was no applause, no judgment, no absolution. Only the murmur --
that collective acknowledgment that shame was shared, that vulnerability
was strength, that the weight of failure was lighter when distributed
across a community of equals.

It was, Jack realized, the most civilized thing he had ever witnessed.

And his turn was coming.


                              III.

He had prepared a confession. Gloria had helped him craft it -- a
careful, diplomatic admission of a minor failing: his tendency to
prioritize work over personal relationships, his neglect of his
friendship with a college roommate who had died the previous year
without Jack having visited. It was true. It was genuine. It was
exactly calibrated to convey vulnerability without compromising
security.

It was the kind of thing a diplomat would say.

Jack sat at the table as the Unburdening moved around the circle, and
he felt the prepared confession sitting in his chest like a counterfeit
coin -- technically valid, functionally worthless. The Centauri were
not confessing diplomatic failings. They were confessing real ones.
They were opening their chests and showing the room what was inside,
and what was inside was messy and specific and human -- or whatever the
Centauri equivalent of human was -- and Jack knew, with the certainty
of a man who has spent his career reading rooms, that his prepared
confession would not pass.

The Centauri would hear it and recognize it for what it was: a
performance. A diplomatic maneuver dressed up as vulnerability. And
they would smile and nod and the evening would continue, and the
treaty would be renewed, and nothing would change, and Earth would
remain what it had always been to the Alliance -- a promising but
untrustworthy puppy, tolerated but not trusted, admitted to the table
but never to the family.

Or he could tell the truth.

The truth was classified. The truth was a military secret that Jack
had learned three months ago in a closed-door briefing at Space
Command, a secret that had kept him awake at night and that he had
not shared with anyone, including Gloria, because sharing it would
constitute a felony under the Interstellar Security Act.

The truth was this: during the last year of the Centauri War -- the
war that had ended eleven years ago with a treaty of mutual respect
and the establishment of the Alliance -- the United Earth Government
had developed a weapon. A planet-killer. A device capable of
rendering an entire world uninhabitable through targeted disruption
of its magnetosphere. The weapon had never been used. It had never
been deployed. But it had been built, and it had been tested -- on an
uninhabited dwarf planet in the Kuiper Belt -- and it still existed,
maintained in secret by Space Command, a contingency against a war
that everyone hoped would never come again.

The Centauri did not know about the weapon. If they learned of its
existence, the consequences would be severe: the Alliance was founded
on mutual disarmament, and a secret planet-killer was, by any
reasonable interpretation, a violation of the treaty. At minimum, the
trade agreement would be voided. At maximum, it could reignite the
conflict.

Jack's greatest shame was not that the weapon existed. Governments
built weapons. That was what governments did. His greatest shame was
that he knew about it and had said nothing -- not to the Alliance, not
to the public, not to anyone. He had kept the secret because keeping
secrets was his job, and because he understood, with the cold
pragmatism of a career diplomat, that some truths were too dangerous
to share.

But the Centauri were sitting across from him, their skins violet
with the joy of shared vulnerability, and they had just spent six
hours showing him their flaws, and the counterfeit coin in his chest
was getting heavier by the minute.

His turn came. He stood. The room fell silent.

Gloria, at the periphery of the hall, caught his eye. She could not
hear his thoughts, but she could read his face, and what she read
there made her own face go very still.

Jack looked at Vel'thaan. The old Centauri's three eyes were steady,
patient, ancient. He had seen civilizations rise and fall. He had
seen wars begun and ended. He had seen every form of diplomacy from
naked aggression to genuine fellowship, and he was watching Jack now
with an expression that Jack could only describe as hope.

Jack took a breath.

"I confess my shame," he said. And then he told the truth.


                              IV.

The silence that followed was not the sympathetic murmur that had
greeted every other confession. It was absolute -- a silence so
complete that Jack could hear the faint hum of the ventilation
system in the ceiling high above, and the soft biological clicking
that the Centauri made when they were processing information, and
the sound of his own heart, beating much faster than he would have
liked.

Vel'thaan's skin had shifted from violet to a color Jack had never
seen before: a deep, shimmering gold that moved across his body in
waves, like sunlight on water. Around the table, the other Centauri
were shifting through a spectrum of colors -- blues, greens, reds,
violets -- a chromatic chaos that the translator could not decode
and that Gloria, when Jack glanced at her, was watching with an
expression of undisguised horror.

"You have spoken truth," Vel'thaan said. His voice was quiet. "You
have spoken truth that costs."

"Yes."

"You understand the consequences."

"Some of them. Probably not all."

Vel'thaan was silent for a long moment. The gold color on his skin
deepened, became almost metallic, and then slowly -- very slowly --
began to shift back toward violet.

"In our tradition," Vel'thaan said, "a truth that costs the speaker
is the only truth worth hearing. A confession that risks nothing is
not a confession but an advertisement." He looked around the table.
The other Centauri had settled, their skins returning to the blue-
violet range. "You have given us a gift and a problem, Ambassador.
The gift is your honesty. The problem is your weapon."

"I know."

"Your government will not be pleased."

"My government is going to court-martial me." Jack was surprised to
find that he was smiling. It was not a happy smile, exactly. It was
the smile of a man who has just jumped off a cliff and discovered,
midway down, that he feels lighter than he has in years. "But that's
my problem, not yours."

"No," Vel'thaan said. "It is ours. You are at our table. You have
eaten our food. You have shared your burden. You are, for this
evening and by our law, family. And family does not let family face
consequences alone."

Jack felt something shift inside him -- something that had been
locked tight for three months, a knot of secrecy and shame that had
been sitting in his chest like a fist. It did not untie itself. It
simply dissolved, the way a cramp dissolves when you finally stretch
the muscle, and what replaced it was a feeling he had not expected: relief.

"What happens now?" he asked.

"Now," Vel'thaan said, "we eat dessert. The dessert is very good.
And then we discuss the weapon, and the treaty, and the future of the
relationship between your people and ours. We discuss it honestly,
because you have given us the gift of honesty, and we are not so
ungracious as to waste it."

The dessert was, in fact, extraordinary -- a crystalline confection
that tasted of honey and starlight and something the translator
rendered as "the flavor of a good decision." Jack ate it slowly,
savoring each bite, while around him the Centauri murmured and their
skins pulsed with colors that the translator was struggling to keep
up with.

Gloria appeared at his elbow. "Ambassador," she whispered. "Do you
understand what you've just done?"

"Committed a felony, probably started an interstellar incident, and
definitely ruined my career. Also, this dessert is incredible. Have
you tried it?"

"Jack--"

"Gloria." He looked at her. "I spent three months carrying a lie to a
dinner where everyone else was telling the truth. What was I supposed
to do?"

She stared at him for a long moment. Then, very slowly, she reached
for one of the dessert crystals and put it in her mouth. Her
expression shifted from horror to surprise to something that looked,
despite everything, like a smile.

"You're right," she said. "The dessert is incredible."

The negotiations lasted four days. They were, by unanimous agreement,
the most productive diplomatic discussions in the history of human-
Centauri relations. The weapon was acknowledged, its existence
condemned, and a mutual inspection regime was established that would,
over the following decade, lead to the most comprehensive disarmament
agreement in the history of either species. The trade treaty was not
only renewed but expanded. Earth was admitted to the Alliance as a
full member, rather than an associate, for the first time.

Jack was, as predicted, court-martialed. He was also, as he had not
predicted, acquitted -- on the grounds that his disclosure had served
the national interest in ways that his prosecutors had difficulty
defining but that the judge, a pragmatic woman from Omaha, summarized
as "sometimes the right thing and the legal thing are different
things, and this court is not so foolish as to punish a man for
choosing the right one."

He returned to Proxima Station, resumed his post, and was invited to
the next Feast of Unburdening, where he confessed that he had been
terrified at the previous one and had almost given the prepared speech.

The Centauri murmured. Vel'thaan's skin turned green -- the color of
amusement.

"We know," the old Centauri said. "We could smell it."

"You could smell my fear?"

"We could smell your prepared speech. It had the scent of -- how do
you say it -- something that is not rotten but not fresh."

"Staleness?"

"Yes. Staleness. Your truth, Ambassador, smelled much better."

Jack laughed. It was, he reflected, the first time he had laughed in
a diplomatic setting without it being a tactical decision. It felt good.
It felt, for lack of a better word, honest.

He reached for the dessert.

                       A LIGHT IN NOVEMBER

                        by Danny Kowalski

================================================================================

                              I.

The last sunset of the year came on November 3rd, and Suki watched it
from the roof of the colony's weather station, which was the tallest
building in New Providence and also, in Suki's opinion, the only one
worth climbing.

It wasn't much of a sunset by Earth standards -- she'd seen pictures,
and Earth sunsets had colors she couldn't even name, reds and oranges
and purples that spilled across the sky like paint knocked off a
table. New Providence's sun, Kepler-47c, was a small, cool star that
gave off a light more silver than gold, and when it set it didn't
splash or spill or do anything dramatic. It just sank. Slow and calm,
like an old man lowering himself into a bath, and the sky went from
silver to grey to a deep, dark blue that got deeper and darker until
it was black.

And then it stayed black. For three months.

"The Long Dark," her mother called it, which Suki thought was pretty
obvious, like calling water "the wet stuff." But the grown-ups treated
it like it was something important and scary, the way they treated
everything -- the radiation counts, the soil pH, the atmospheric
oxygen levels, the quarterly supply ship that came from Earth orbit
and brought things like medicine and machine parts and, once, a crate
of chocolate bars that the entire colony had shared out, one square per
person, on the anniversary of the landing.

Suki was fourteen. She had been born on New Providence. She had never
been to Earth, never seen a real sunset with real colors, never stood
under a blue sky or felt rain on her face. New Providence was all she
knew, and she loved it the way you love the only home you've ever had:
completely, unquestioningly, with a fierce loyalty that didn't need
reasons because it was older than reasons.

But the Long Dark scared her. She would never have admitted this to
anyone -- she was fourteen, and fourteen-year-olds on New Providence
were expected to be tough, to carry their weight, to not complain
about things that couldn't be changed. But when the sun went down and
the sky went black and the temperature dropped to minus forty and the
colony's windows were sealed and the grow-lights in the greenhouses
were turned up to maximum and everyone settled in for ninety-two days
of darkness, Suki felt something in her chest that was cold and heavy
and that no amount of grow-light could warm.

She was afraid of the dark. Not the kind of afraid that made you
scream or run or hide under the covers -- she'd grown out of that
years ago. The kind of afraid that sat quietly in your stomach and
whispered things you didn't want to hear, like: what if the sun
doesn't come back? What if this is it? What if the dark goes on
forever and ever and we're just sitting here in the cold, waiting
for nothing?

She knew the sun would come back. She knew the orbital mechanics.
She'd done the math in Mr. Petrosian's science class, calculated
the axial tilt and the orbital period and the exact date and time of
the next sunrise: February 2nd, 0847 hours, local time. The math was
certain. The universe was reliable.

But the dark was very dark, and three months was a very long time,
and Suki was fourteen, and being fourteen meant that the gap between
what you knew and what you felt was wide enough to fall into.

So this year, she had a plan.


                              II.

"You want to do what?" said her mother, who was stirring a pot of
reconstituted soup on the colony's communal stove and who had the
look she always got when Suki proposed something ambitious, which was
a mixture of pride and alarm, like watching a baby bird try to fly off
a very high branch.

"I want to document the bioluminescents," Suki said. "During the
Long Dark. All of them."

Her mother set down the spoon. "Suki. The bioluminescents come out
when it's minus forty. You'd have to go outside. At night. In the
cold. For three months."

"Not all three months. Just -- a lot of it. Mr. Petrosian says the
bioluminescents are the least-studied organisms on the planet. Nobody's
ever done a complete survey. Nobody's even tried, because everybody's
too busy staying warm and keeping the lights on."

"For good reason."

"Mom. I'll wear my thermal suit. I'll stay within two hundred meters
of the colony perimeter. I'll carry a beacon. I'll check in every
thirty minutes on the radio. I've already talked to Dr. Okafor and
she said she'd supervise -- she wants the data for her xenobiology
research."

Her mother looked at her. Suki knew that look. It was the look that
meant her mother was weighing two fears against each other: the fear
of letting her daughter go outside into the freezing dark, and the
fear of raising a daughter who was too afraid to try.

"Every thirty minutes," her mother said.

"Every thirty minutes."

"And if the temperature drops below minus fifty, you come inside
immediately."

"Immediately."

Her mother picked up the spoon. "Then I suppose you'd better start
planning."

Suki grinned. She grinned so hard her face hurt, and she ran to her
bunk and pulled out the notebook she'd been keeping since September --
a real notebook, paper and pen, because electronics had a tendency to
die in the cold -- and she opened it to the page where she'd written,
in careful block letters:

THE LONG DARK SURVEY: A COMPLETE CATALOG OF BIOLUMINESCENT ORGANISMS
ON NEW PROVIDENCE (KEPLER-47c)
by Suki Okonkwo-Tanaka, age 14
Colony Year 12

Below the title she had drawn a border of small stars, because she
was fourteen and because stars were what you drew when you were writing
about the dark.


                              III.

The first night of the Long Dark, Suki almost didn't go.

The colony sealed up at 1600 hours -- windows shuttered, external
hatches locked, the big diesel generators that powered the heating
system rumbling to life with a sound like a giant clearing its throat.
The grow-lights in the greenhouses came on, casting a warm amber glow
that leaked through the connecting corridors and gave the colony's
interior a cozy, golden-hour look that was completely artificial and
completely comforting.

Outside, the temperature was minus thirty-seven and dropping.

Suki stood in the airlock in her thermal suit -- a bulky, insulated
coverall that made her look like a very small, very determined
marshmallow -- and she looked at the outer door and felt the cold fear
in her stomach, the one that whispered: stay inside. Stay warm. Stay
safe.

She thought about Mr. Petrosian, who had come to New Providence on
the first colony ship at age twenty-six and who had spent twelve years
teaching science to children on an alien world with a patience and an
enthusiasm that never flagged, even on the days when the lab equipment
broke down and they had to do chemistry with kitchen supplies. He had
told her once that the difference between a scientist and a regular
person was not intelligence -- "there are plenty of intelligent people
who never discover anything" -- but willingness. Willingness to go
look. Willingness to go outside, into the cold and the dark, and
see what was there.

Suki opened the outer door.

The dark hit her like a wall. Not darkness -- Dark. A darkness so
complete, so absolute, so entire that it seemed to have weight and
texture, like being submerged in black water. There were no stars
tonight -- the cloud cover was solid, a thick blanket of frozen
methane crystals that blocked everything above -- and without the
stars there was nothing. No light at all. No reference points. No up,
no down, no near, no far. Just dark.

She stood in the airlock doorway and felt the dark press against her
face like a cold hand, and she almost turned around.

And then she saw it.

A light. A tiny light, no bigger than a firefly, drifting through the
darkness about twenty meters from the colony wall. It was blue -- a
pale, electric blue, the color of a spark jumping between wires --
and it moved with a slow, deliberate grace that was nothing like the
random flutter of an insect. It drifted, paused, drifted again, as
if it were exploring, examining the dark the way a person examines
an unfamiliar room.

Suki watched it, her breath fogging inside her helmet visor, her
heart pounding.

Another light appeared. This one was green -- not the green of
grow-lights or electronics, but a deep, living green, the green of
things that grew in the deep sea on Earth, things she'd only seen in
pictures. It rose from the ground near the colony's eastern wall and
floated upward in a slow spiral, turning as it climbed, its light
pulsing in a rhythm that was almost -- almost -- like breathing.

Then more. A cluster of amber lights near the greenhouse, bobbing
gently, like lanterns on a string. A streak of violet that shot
across the ground like a comet, there and gone in a second. A soft,
warm gold that seeped up from the soil itself, spreading in a
widening circle like spilled honey.

The dark was alive.

Suki stepped out of the airlock. She pulled her notebook from her
suit pocket and fumbled it open with her thick gloves. She could
barely hold the pen, and she couldn't see what she was writing, so
she just wrote by feel, pressing hard enough to leave marks she could
read later:

Nov 3. 1847hrs. First night. Cloudy. Temp -38C.
Blue drifter, 20m east. Single, slow-moving, approx 2cm diameter.
Green riser, east wall. Spiral ascent, pulsing, approx 5cm.
Amber cluster, greenhouse vicinity, 6-8 individuals, bobbing.
Violet streaker, ground level, fast.
Gold ground-glow, spreading from soil, broad.

She stood in the dark and watched and wrote and shivered and watched
some more, and the lights drifted and pulsed and streaked around her,
and the cold whisper in her stomach was still there but it was quieter
now, because the dark was not empty after all. The dark was full. The
dark was full of things she had never seen, things nobody had ever
seen, things that existed only in the absence of light, that emerged
from the frozen soil and the frozen air and the frozen darkness
itself to do whatever it was they did in the ninety-two days when the
sun was gone.

She stayed out for forty-seven minutes. She checked in on the radio
every thirty. When she came back inside, her fingers were numb, her
toes were tingling, and her notebook was full of observations written
in handwriting so shaky it looked like a seismograph reading.

She was grinning.


                              IV.

Over the following weeks, Suki went out every night.

She developed a routine. At 1800 hours, after dinner and homework, she
suited up in the airlock, checked her beacon and her radio, and
stepped out into the dark. She carried her notebook, a hand-light
(which she rarely used, because the bioluminescents dimmed or fled
when artificial light appeared), and a small camera that Dr. Okafor
had lent her -- a specialized instrument with a sensor sensitive
enough to photograph light sources in near-total darkness.

She cataloged seventeen distinct species in the first two weeks.

The Blue Drifters were the most common -- small, spherical organisms
that floated through the air like living bubbles, their blue light
steady and cool. Dr. Okafor theorized that they were colonial
organisms, clusters of single-celled creatures that aggregated for
warmth and produced light as a byproduct of their metabolism. Suki
didn't care about the theory. She cared about the way they moved --
with a quiet, wandering purposefulness, as if they were looking for
something, and the way they sometimes clustered around her helmet
visor, drawn by her breath-heat, surrounding her face with a halo
of blue light that made her feel like a saint in an old painting.

The Green Risers were rarer and more mysterious. They emerged from
the soil near the colony walls -- always near the walls, as if they
were attracted to the vibration of the generators or the residual
heat of the buildings -- and spiraled upward in slow, elegant helices,
their light pulsing in patterns that Suki began to suspect were not
random. She recorded the patterns on her camera and brought them to
Dr. Okafor, who fed them into the colony's computer and stared at
the results with an expression that Suki had learned to recognize
as scientific excitement disguised as professional composure.

"There's a pattern," Dr. Okafor said. "The pulses aren't random.
They're sequential. Each organism in a spiral pulses in sequence with
the others, like a round in music. They're communicating."

"What are they saying?" Suki asked.

Dr. Okafor smiled. "I have absolutely no idea. But they're definitely
saying it."

The Amber Bobbers were Suki's favorites. They congregated near warm
structures -- the greenhouses, the generator building, the colony's
waste heat vents -- and they bobbed gently in the thermal currents
like tiny lanterns. Their light was the warmest -- a deep, honeyed
amber that seemed to push back the dark a little, to create small
pools of warmth in the freezing night. Suki would sit near the
greenhouse, wrapped in her thermal suit, surrounded by Amber Bobbers,
and she felt -- not warm, exactly. The cold was still minus forty and
it was still bitter and her fingers still went numb after twenty
minutes. But she felt accompanied. She felt as if the dark was not
indifferent after all, as if there were other living things out here
in the cold, other consciousness doing what she was doing: enduring,
waiting, making light.

She documented the Violet Streakers (fast, ground-level, impossible
to photograph), the Gold Ground-Glows (a fungal network, Dr. Okafor
determined, that permeated the soil and bioluminesced during the
Long Dark, turning patches of frozen ground into glowing pools of
light), the Silver Weavers (thread-like organisms that strung
themselves between objects -- rocks, buildings, equipment -- and
glowed with a faint silver light that made the colony look, from a
distance, like it was wrapped in a spiderweb of stars).

She documented the Red Bloom -- a rare event that happened only once,
on a night in December when the temperature dropped to minus fifty-one
and Suki's mother radioed her frantically to come inside immediately.
Suki was already inside the airlock when she saw it: a wave of deep
red light that rolled across the landscape from east to west, like a
slow-motion sunrise, turning the frozen ground crimson for thirty
seconds before fading to nothing. She stood in the airlock door and
watched it pass, and she thought: that is the most beautiful thing
I have ever seen.

She wrote it down. She wrote everything down. By mid-December, her
notebook was full, and she started a second one, and then a third.
She filled them with observations, sketches, measurements, questions.
She wrote in her shaky, cold-handed scrawl, pressing hard enough to
feel through her gloves, and every entry began with the same heading:
the date, the time, the temperature, and the darkness.

The darkness was always the same. Total. Absolute. Complete.

And always, always full of light.


                               V.

On February 2nd, at 0847 hours, the sun came back.

Suki was on the roof of the weather station, where she had watched it
leave three months ago. She had her notebook open to the last page.
She had her camera ready. Around her, the entire colony had come out
to watch -- four hundred and eighteen people, bundled in thermal suits,
standing on the frozen ground, their faces turned toward the eastern
horizon.

The sky was clear. For the first time in weeks, the methane clouds had
parted, and the stars were visible -- thousands of them, sharp and
bright and unwavering in the thin atmosphere, a sky so full of light
that it made Suki's chest hurt.

And then, at the horizon, a change. Not light, exactly. Not yet. More
like a promise of light -- a faint, barely perceptible brightening at
the edge of the world, a shift from black to the deepest possible
blue, a color so dark it was almost not a color at all but just a
suggestion, a rumor, a whisper that said: I am coming. Wait for me.

The colony held its breath.

The brightening spread. The blue deepened and then lightened, moving
up the spectrum from midnight to navy to something that Suki had
never seen before and that took her a moment to identify: sky blue.
The real thing. The color that her mother talked about, the color of
Earth's daytime sky, appearing here, on New Providence, at the edge
of the universe, after ninety-two days of darkness.

And then the sun.

It appeared as a sliver -- a thin crescent of silver-white light at
the horizon, so bright after three months of darkness that it hurt
to look at, and Suki looked at it anyway, squinting through her
tears, because she had spent ninety-two days in the dark making
friends with the light that lived there, and she was not going to
look away from the light that was coming back.

The sun rose. Slowly, patiently, the way everything on New Providence
happened -- slowly, patiently, as if the universe understood that
this world needed time, that its people needed time, that after three
months of darkness the return of light was not a casual event but a
miracle, no matter how many times it had happened before and no
matter how many times it would happen again.

Around her, the colony cheered. Four hundred and eighteen voices,
rising into the brightening sky, shouting and crying and laughing and
saying things that didn't need to be words because the feeling was
bigger than language.

Suki did not cheer. She sat on the roof of the weather station with
her notebook open, and she watched the light spill across the frozen
landscape, and she watched the bioluminescents.

They were fading. The Blue Drifters dimmed and sank, settling to the
ground like spent fireworks. The Green Risers unwound their spirals
and dissolved into the soil. The Amber Bobbers drifted away from the
warm buildings, their light guttering, their slow bobbing stilling.
The Silver Weavers' threads went dark, becoming invisible against the
brightening sky. The Gold Ground-Glows retreated into the soil, their
light contracting, concentrating, disappearing.

The dark's creatures were going home.

Suki watched them go, and she felt something she had not expected:
sadness. Not the heavy, cold sadness of the Long Dark's first night.
A different kind. A lighter kind. The sadness of saying goodbye to
friends, even when you know you'll see them again.

She opened her notebook and wrote the last entry:

Feb 2. 0847hrs. Sunrise. Temp -29C (warming).
All bioluminescent species retreating with advancing light.
Blue Drifters: descending, dimming. Last observed 0853.
Green Risers: dissolving. Last observed 0849.
Amber Bobbers: dispersing. Last observed 0901.
Silver Weavers: dark. Last observed (visual) 0847.
Gold Ground-Glows: contracting. Last observed 0912.
No Violet Streakers, no Red Bloom.

Below this she wrote:

End of survey. 92 days. 17 species cataloged. 3 notebooks filled.
0 nights missed.

And below that, in smaller letters, not for the survey but for
herself:

Thank you for the light.

She closed the notebook and sat on the roof and watched the sun rise
over New Providence, and she did not feel the cold anymore, and she
did not feel the fear anymore, and she knew -- with the certainty of
a fourteen-year-old who has spent three months in the dark and come
out the other side -- that the dark was not the enemy. The dark was
just the place where different lights lived. And if you were brave
enough to go outside, and patient enough to watch, and careful enough
to write it all down, the dark would show you things that the daylight
never could.

She climbed down from the weather station and went inside and ate
breakfast and showed her mother the notebooks and went to bed, because
she had not slept properly in ninety-two days and she was very, very
tired.

She dreamed of lights: blue and green and amber and violet and gold,
drifting through a darkness that was not dark at all but full, full
of life, full of mystery, full of things waiting to be discovered by
the next kid brave enough to open the door.

                       ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

GUNNAR ERIKSSON makes his second appearance in these pages with "The
Cathedral of Ice," a story of such austere beauty that it silenced
the editorial office for a full afternoon. A native of Stockholm,
Sweden, Eriksson writes in English with a clarity and cadence that
puts most native speakers to shame. He works as a literary translator,
rendering American novels into Swedish by day and Swedish melancholy
into science fiction by night. His first story for us, "The Cradle and
the Void" (Issue #5), drew more reader mail than any story we have
published to date, including a remarkable letter from Ray Bradbury.
Eriksson responded to Mr. Bradbury's praise with characteristic
understatement: "I am honored. Please tell him the lonely story
sends its regards."

THEODORE CAIN returns with "Ledger of War," a story
that proves what we have long suspected: that Cain can write anything.
A former autoworker who now writes full-time from his home in
Dearborn, Michigan, Cain has appeared in nearly every issue of this
magazine and shows no signs of slowing down. His wife Jean reports that
he writes every evening from eight until midnight, seven days a week,
and that the only force capable of interrupting him is the smell of
fresh coffee. "Ledger of War" arrived at our office
accompanied by a note that read: "This one kept me up past midnight.
I hope it does the same for someone else."

CORDELL BEAUMONT makes his debut in these pages with "Feast of the
Forgotten," and what a debut it is. Born and raised in New Orleans,
Beaumont writes with a sensory richness that is positively intoxicating
-- you can taste the alien fruit, smell the cinnamon bark, feel the
persimmon light on your face. He is a gourmet cook, an amateur
botanist, and a collector of maps of imaginary places, and all three
avocations are visible in his prose. His first published story, "The
Vermillion Plateau," appeared in our October issue and immediately
established him as a writer of singular gifts. We expect great things
from Mr. Beaumont, and we suspect he will deliver them in his own
time, at his own pace, with a glass of bourbon in hand.

HAROLD "HAL" MERCER brings his engineer's eye to "Rust and Remember,"
a story about tearing things down that is, paradoxically, one of the
most constructive stories we have published. A civil engineer by
profession and a writer by vocation, Mercer brings an authenticity to
his descriptions of large-scale engineering that no amount of research
could replicate. He lives in Akron, Ohio, with his wife Dorothy and
their four sons, and he writes, he tells us, at the kitchen table
after the boys have gone to bed, with a slide rule in his pocket and
a cup of coffee at his elbow. His debut story, "Load-Bearing" (Issue
#7), remains one of our most requested reprints.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY delivers "Confessional Protocol" with all the
verve and velocity his readers have come to expect, plus something
new: a genuine emotional depth that surprised even this editor. A
veteran of the pulp magazines who has published over two hundred
stories across every genre imaginable, Finley brings a professional's
craft and a storyteller's instinct to everything he writes. He lives
in Chicago with his wife Carol and an indeterminate number of cats,
follows the White Sox with religious devotion, and insists that the
best writing advice he ever received was from his first editor: "Start
fast, end faster, and never bore the reader." He has never bored us.

DANNY KOWALSKI makes his debut with "A Light in November," a story
that captures the wonder of discovery with a freshness and sincerity
that is entirely his own. A middle school science teacher in
Pittsburgh, Kowalski writes about young people the way young people
actually think and feel -- with intensity, with curiosity, with a
bravery that adults have often forgotten they once possessed. He grew
up in Pittsburgh's Polish Hill neighborhood, discovered science
fiction at the public library, and has never recovered. He tells us
that "A Light in November" was inspired by a student who asked him
what lived in the dark, and that he wrote the story to answer her
question. We think he answered it beautifully.

                        SIGNALS RECEIVED

                   Letters from Our Readers

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am writing to express my profound admiration for Gunnar Eriksson's
"The Cradle and the Void" in your May issue. I am a sixty-seven-year-
old retired minister in Uppsala, Sweden -- yes, the same Uppsala where
Mr. Eriksson attended university -- and I must tell you that his story
moved me more deeply than any sermon I have delivered or heard in forty
years of ministry. The scene in which the ship's chaplain holds a
funeral service for a child who has never seen the sun -- I had to set
the magazine down and collect myself. Please tell Mr. Eriksson that
there is at least one old clergyman in Sweden who considers him a
colleague, whether he likes it or not.

                    -- Rev. Anders Johansson, Uppsala, Sweden

[Editor's note: Reverend Johansson's letter was forwarded to Mr.
Eriksson, who replied: "Tell the Reverend that I accept the
colleagueship with gratitude, and that I have always believed
the pulpit and the writing desk face the same congregation."]

Dear Editor,

Theodore Cain is the backbone of your magazine, and I think he deserves
more recognition than he gets. Every month he delivers a solid,
entertaining story that I can count on the way I count on the sun
coming up. He may not be flashy, but he is reliable, and in my
experience reliability is a more valuable quality than genius. I work
on a road crew in Nebraska and I read your magazine on my lunch break,
and Mr. Cain's stories are the ones that get me through the afternoon.
Tell him his readers appreciate him.

                    -- Frank Wojtowicz, Grand Island, Nebraska

[Editor's note: We could not agree more, Mr. Wojtowicz. Mr. Cain is
indeed the backbone of this magazine, and we are grateful for him
every single month. He asks us to tell you that "the backbone
appreciates being noticed, and hopes you're staying safe on that
road crew."]

Dear Tales from the Future and Beyond,

Your September issue (#9) was excellent, but I must take exception to
the suggestion in "The Signal Garden" that faster-than-light
communication could be achieved through entangled particle states.
As any student of quantum mechanics knows, quantum entanglement cannot
be used to transmit information faster than light, as this would
violate the no-communication theorem. I realize this is fiction, but
bad physics is bad physics, even in fiction, and especially in a
magazine that prides itself on scientific rigor.

                    -- Dr. Miriam Schultz, Department of Physics,
                       Massachusetts Institute of Technology

[Editor's note: Dr. Schultz is, of course, correct, and we apologize
for the error. In our defense, we note that faster-than-light
communication is also used by approximately seventy percent of all
science fiction stories published in the English language, and that
if we banned every story that violated known physics, this magazine
would be approximately four pages long. We have forwarded Dr.
Schultz's letter to the author, who replies: "Tell Dr. Schultz that
in my universe, the no-communication theorem took the day off."]

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am fifteen years old and I have a question. How do I become a
science fiction writer? I have written three stories and they are
all terrible but I can't stop writing them. My English teacher says
I should write about real life but real life is boring and the future
is interesting. Please advise.

                    -- Patricia Morales, Tucson, Arizona

[Editor's note: Miss Morales, you have already begun. The fact that
you have written three stories and know they are terrible is more
promising than you realize -- most aspiring writers think their first
efforts are masterpieces, and they are wrong. Keep writing. Write
every day. Read everything you can get your hands on, including the
real-life stories your English teacher recommends, because the best
science fiction is always, secretly, about real life. And send us
your fourth story. We make no promises, but our door is open.]

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW

                  Reviews by Dorothy Haywood

================================================================================

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.50)

Clement's novel -- expanded from the serialization in ASTOUNDING -- is
the hardest of hard science fiction, and I mean this as unqualified
praise. Set on the high-gravity world of Mesklin, where gravity
ranges from three times Earth-normal at the equator to nearly seven
hundred times at the poles, the novel follows the journey of the
Mesklinite captain Barlennan across his extraordinary planet to
recover a stranded human probe. The science is rigorous, the world-
building is spectacular, and Clement's ability to make the reader feel
the crushing weight of Mesklin's gravity -- the way it shapes the
natives' psychology, their architecture, their very concept of height
and distance -- is a tour de force of imaginative engineering. The
characterization is perhaps secondary to the physics, but Barlennan
is a vivid and likeable creation, and the partnership between the
tiny Mesklinite captain and his human allies is genuinely moving.
Required reading for anyone who believes that scientific accuracy and
narrative excitement are incompatible.

---

THE DEMOLISHED MAN by Alfred Bester
(Shasta Publishers, 1953, $2.50)

Bester's debut novel, winner of the inaugural Hugo Award, is a
dazzling, pyrotechnic performance that reads less like traditional
science fiction than like a jazz improvisation on the themes of crime
and punishment. In a society where telepaths -- "peepers" -- make
premeditated murder virtually impossible, industrialist Ben Reich
attempts the impossible: a murder that even the most powerful telepath
cannot detect. The premise is ingenious, but it is Bester's execution
that elevates the novel to brilliance: his prose is kinetic, his
pacing relentless, his typographical experiments (representing
telepathic communication through visual patterns on the page) are
audacious and effective, and his vision of a telepathic society is
worked out with a thoroughness that puts most world-builders to shame.
The final revelation -- which I will not spoil -- reframes everything
that has come before in a way that is simultaneously surprising and
inevitable. A landmark work, and one that suggests the field of
science fiction is capable of far more formal innovation than its
critics give it credit for.

THE SPACE MERCHANTS by Frederik Pohl and C. M. Kornbluth
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

Pohl and Kornbluth's satirical novel of a future dominated by
advertising agencies is the most uncomfortably prescient work of
science fiction I have read in years. Set in a world where
corporations have replaced governments, consumers are manipulated
through addictive products and relentless marketing, and the last
remaining resource -- Venus -- is about to be colonized by the highest
bidder, the novel reads less like a 1953 extrapolation than a 1953
prophecy. The satire is sharp, the plot is propulsive, and the
authors' understanding of the mechanics of persuasion -- how
advertising shapes desire, how desire shapes politics, how politics
shapes reality -- is unsettlingly acute. The prose style is brisk
and professional, reflecting both authors' backgrounds in commercial
publishing, and the collaboration is seamless. If the ending feels
slightly too optimistic for the world it depicts, this is a minor
flaw in what is otherwise a major achievement. Every advertising
executive in the country should read this book, and every one of them
should be made very nervous by it.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS

              A Preview of Issue #12 -- December 1953

================================================================================

Next month, TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND celebrates its FIRST
ANNIVERSARY with a very special HOLIDAY ISSUE -- seven stories of
wonder, warmth, and the enduring human capacity for joy in the depths
of the cosmos.

Featured stories will include:

"BETHLEHEM RUN" by Father Thomas Aquino -- Captain Maria
Santos commands a relief ship racing to deliver medical supplies to a
plague-stricken colony by Christmas Day. When her navigational computer
fails, she must rely on celestial navigation -- literally following a
star -- to find her way. A story that weaves theology and astronavigation
into something genuinely moving.

"TWELVE PARSECS OF CHRISTMAS" by Theodore Cain -- A down-on-his-luck
freighter captain takes a holiday cargo job that requires twelve stops
across twelve star systems in twelve days. Each delivery is stranger
than the last, and the payoff is more emotional than you expect.

"NUTCRACKER PROTOCOL" by Arthur Wainwright -- A children's hospital
robot, programmed to perform in a holiday pageant, begins to deviate
from its script. What it tells the children instead is a story about
stories -- and about the machines that learn to tell them.

Also: Dr. Vincent Koslov contemplates winter on a dying world. Douglas
Pemberton delivers an interstellar Gift of the Magi. Agnes Whitfield
finds a midnight clear in the ruins. And Phyllis Crenshaw unravels a
Christmas Eve that keeps repeating.

Seven stories. Seven gifts from our writers to you. Plus: a look back
at our first year, letters from our readers, book reviews, and a
very special announcement about our plans for 1954.

Issue #12 will be on newsstands December 3rd.

Happy holidays, dear reader. We'll see you among the stars.
