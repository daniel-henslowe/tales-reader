TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

February is upon us again, and with it the annual obligation — which I do
not regard as an obligation at all, but rather a delight — to turn our
gaze from the void between stars and toward the somewhat more terrifying
void between hearts.

This is our fourth Valentine's issue, and those of you who have been with
us since Issue #14 (February 1954) will know that I take a particular
pleasure in assembling these collections. Not because I am a sentimental
man — ask my staff, and they will disabuse you of that notion in
colorful terms — but because I believe that love is the most science-
fictional of all human experiences. Consider the premise: two separate
consciousnesses, each trapped in its own skull, each perceiving the
universe through its own imperfect instruments, somehow manage to bridge
that gap and form a connection that defies entropy, distance, and common
sense. If that is not a speculative fiction, I do not know what is.

This year, I have asked our contributors to go further. What if the gap
were not merely neurological but biological? What if the beings in
question could not touch, could not see each other, could not even
breathe the same air? What if one of them were a ten-foot combat
mechanism with no conception of dinner conversation? What if one of them
were dead?

The answers, I am pleased to report, are extraordinary.

Margaret Thornton opens our issue with "Species Barrier," a love
story between beings who cannot perceive each other in any direct way,
and which is, I believe, her finest and most unconventional work to date.
Douglas Pemberton follows with a comic masterpiece about a lonely miner
and a very confused war machine that had my entire office weeping with
laughter. Phyllis Crenshaw gives us a time loop story of staggering
emotional power, and Gunnar Eriksson offers a meditation on distance,
longing, and the postal service that may be the most beautiful thing he
has ever written — and I do not say that lightly.

Rex Drummond, never one to do anything by halves, gives us a love story
that involves a sword fight on the hull of a moving starship. And
Theodore Cain wraps us up with a systems-failure farce that proves the
universe has a sense of humor about romance, even if the universe's
sense of humor is deeply inconvenient.

Six stories. Six kinds of love, across every conceivable barrier. I am
enormously proud of this issue. I hope you will find in it something
that speaks to whatever improbable connection you are fortunate enough
to have found — or foolish enough to still be seeking.

Happy Valentine's Day. The cosmos, I suspect, is rooting for all of us.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                        SPECIES BARRIER

                       by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                               I.

The first time Dr. Lena Garrow perceived Dr. Ixen-tel-Ixen, it was as a
data set.

Specifically, it was as a column of atmospheric composition readings
transmitted from the Teth side of Research Station Equinox to the human
side, time-stamped 04:17 UTC, accompanied by a notation in the precise,
almost musical syntax of translated Teth: "These values suggest a
catalytic pathway not previously documented. I believe the interaction
warrants further investigation. If the human chemist is amenable, I
would welcome a collaborative analysis."

The human chemist was not amenable. The human chemist was exhausted,
eleven months into a posting she had not wanted, on a station orbiting a
gas giant she had not chosen, separated from her research team at the
Cascades Biological Survey by a bureaucratic reassignment that still made
her jaw tighten when she thought about it. She was forty-one years old,
had published twenty-three papers on exobiological catalysis, and had
been sent to Equinox because someone at the Joint Commission for
Interspecies Research had decided that what the Teth collaboration needed
was a generalist with a strong publication record and a willingness to
work in isolation.

They had gotten the publication record right.

Station Equinox was a double structure — two pressurized habitats joined
by a sealed corridor that neither species could enter. The human side
maintained a standard nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere at 21 degrees Celsius.
The Teth side maintained a dense carbon dioxide atmosphere at 4 degrees
Celsius, saturated with trace compounds whose names Lena could not
pronounce and whose biological functions she was still learning. Between
the two sides lay the data corridor: a sealed space filled with
monitoring equipment, sample transfer mechanisms, and the relay systems
through which all communication passed.

No human had ever entered the Teth side. No Teth had ever entered the
human side. The atmospheres were mutually lethal — not in the dramatic,
instant-death way that made for good cautionary holos, but in the slow,
insidious way that was actually more dangerous. Human lungs could not
process the Teth atmosphere; the concentration of carbon dioxide would
induce hypercapnia within minutes. Teth respiratory membranes could not
tolerate molecular oxygen; it degraded their gas-exchange surfaces in a
manner analogous to, but more severe than, the oxidative damage humans
associated with breathing pure O2 at high pressure.

They could not share air. They could not share space. And they could not
see each other.

This was the detail that had struck Lena most forcibly when she first
reviewed the briefing materials. The Teth perceived the electromagnetic
spectrum in a range shifted dramatically toward the infrared. Their
visual organs — distributed across their upper thoracic surface in a
mosaic pattern that bore no resemblance to bilateral eyes — were
sensitive to wavelengths between 900 and 2500 nanometers. They were
blind to visible light. To a Teth, a human being was invisible — a warm
shape in infrared, perhaps, but without detail, without feature, without
face.

Conversely, humans could not perceive Teth in any meaningful visual
sense. Photographs taken in the Teth visible range showed vague, ghostly
forms that the human brain could not resolve into coherent shapes. The
Teth body plan was radially symmetric, five-lobed, with a central mass
from which five articulated limbs extended — but this clinical description
gave no sense of the organism as a living being. To human eyes, they
were abstractions. Shapes in data. Entries in a taxonomy.

And yet, someone at the Joint Commission had decided that these two
species should do science together.

Lena stared at the atmospheric readings on her screen. The catalytic
pathway Ixen-tel-Ixen had identified was, she had to admit, genuinely
interesting. It suggested a mechanism by which trace sulfur compounds in
the gas giant's upper atmosphere were being converted into complex
organic molecules — a process that, if confirmed, would have significant
implications for models of prebiotic chemistry.

She composed her reply with the careful formality that interspecies
protocol demanded: "Dr. Ixen-tel-Ixen. Thank you for the data and the
observation. I concur that the pathway warrants investigation. I suggest
we begin with a parallel analysis — I will model the kinetics from a
human biochemical framework, and you from a Teth framework, and we will
compare results. Please confirm if this is acceptable."

The response came twelve minutes later, which Lena had learned was fast
for a Teth. "Acceptable and welcomed. I note that your surname, in Teth
phonemic approximation, sounds similar to our word for the pattern light
makes on moving water. I do not know if this is of interest. It is of
interest to me."

Lena read this twice. She was not sure what to do with it. Interspecies
protocol made no provision for the exchange of etymological observations.
She set it aside and began the kinetic analysis.

                               * * *

The work was good.

That was the thing Lena had not expected. She had expected frustration —
the notorious difficulty of cross-species collaboration, the translation
errors, the fundamental incompatibilities in methodology and terminology.
She had expected tedium — the endless back-and-forth of data exchange
through the relay systems, each transmission requiring translation,
annotation, and verification. She had expected loneliness — the human
side of Equinox housed only Lena and two maintenance technicians who
kept to themselves and showed no interest in exobiological catalysis.

What she had not expected was the quality of mind on the other side of
the data corridor.

Ixen-tel-Ixen was brilliant. This became clear within the first week.
The kinetic models Ixen produced were elegant, spare, and startlingly
original — built from a mathematical framework that differed from human
chemistry in fundamental ways but arrived, by different paths, at
compatible conclusions. Where Lena's models emphasized thermodynamic
equilibria, Ixen's emphasized rate-dependent cascade effects. Where Lena
built from molecular structure upward, Ixen built from systemic behavior
downward. The combination, when they laid their models side by side in
the shared analysis space, was richer and more complete than either alone.

"Your approach to the sulfur pathway is unlike anything in our
literature," Lena wrote, three weeks into the collaboration. "The
cascade model resolves an anomaly in the equilibrium data that I could
not account for. I find it — " She paused, searching for the word.
Professional admiration? Intellectual excitement? The precise sensation
of encountering a mind that thought in genuinely new ways? "I find it
illuminating," she finished, and knew the word was inadequate.

"Your word 'illuminating' translates in Teth to a concept that means
both 'providing light' and 'revealing what was hidden,'" Ixen replied.
"We use it to describe the moment when a pattern in data becomes visible
for the first time. I am pleased that our work has this quality for you.
It has this quality for me as well. I had not expected this from a human
collaborator. I say this not as an insult. I say it as a confession of
ignorance."

"No insult taken. I did not expect it from a Teth collaborator either.
We are both confessing ignorance."

"Good. Shared ignorance is the beginning of shared knowledge."

Lena found herself smiling at the screen. She was alone in her
laboratory, and there was no one to see, and she smiled anyway.

                               II.

Two months into the collaboration, they began to talk about things that
were not chemistry.

It started with a question about methodology. Lena had asked Ixen to
explain a particular mathematical notation that appeared in Teth kinetic
models — a symbol that had no direct translation and that the relay
system rendered as an approximation that obscured its meaning. Ixen's
explanation was technical and thorough, but it ended with a parenthetical
observation: "This notation was developed by Keth-en-Keth, a
mathematician of the Third Configuration, who was also a maker of
patterns in woven fiber — what your species might call an artist. The
notation reflects the influence of weaving: it describes how separate
threads of causation intertwine. I mention this because you asked about
methodology, and in Teth culture, methodology is not separable from the
life of the person who develops it."

Lena wrote back: "In human culture, we pretend that methodology is
separable from the life of the person who develops it. We are wrong,
but we pretend."

"Why?"

"Because we are afraid that if our work is connected to our lives, then
our failures in our lives will contaminate our work. And because we are
afraid that if our work is too personal, it will not be taken seriously
by other humans."

A long pause — forty minutes, the longest Ixen had ever taken to reply.
Then: "This is a profound fear. In Teth culture, the opposite is true.
Work that is not personal is not taken seriously. It is considered empty
— a pattern without a weaver. I am sorry that your culture causes you
this fear. Does it cause you this fear?"

Lena stared at the question. It was the most personal thing Ixen had
ever asked her. Interspecies protocol was silent on the subject of
personal fears, just as it was silent on the subject of etymological
observations and the artistic practices of Third Configuration
mathematicians. They had left the territory of protocol some time ago
and were now in uncharted space.

"Yes," she wrote. "It does."

"I am sorry. I would like to understand this better. Not for scientific
purposes. For personal ones."

"I would like to understand Teth weaving," Lena wrote. "Not for
scientific purposes."

"Then we are agreed. We will teach each other things that are not
chemistry."

And they did.

                               * * *

Ixen taught Lena about Teth art — the complex, multidimensional fiber
works that were the primary artistic medium of a species that perceived
the world in infrared. The works were experienced not just visually but
thermally; different fibers radiated heat at different rates, creating
patterns that shifted over time, so that a single piece of art was never
the same from one moment to the next. Ixen described them with a
precision and a passion that made Lena ache with the knowledge that she
would never see one — not truly, not the way Ixen saw them, in the
warm, shifting spectrum that was the Teth visual world.

Lena taught Ixen about music. This required explanation, because the
Teth did not hear in any way analogous to human hearing — their sensory
apparatus detected vibrations in atmospheric pressure, but the range and
resolution were so different from human hearing that what they perceived
bore almost no resemblance to what humans called sound. Lena could not
play music for Ixen. She could only describe it: the mathematics of
harmony, the emotional effects of key and tempo, the way a melody could
lodge in human memory and produce, upon recall, the same emotional
response it had produced upon first hearing.

"You are describing a stored pattern that generates affect upon
retrieval," Ixen wrote. "We have this. But for us it is associated with
thermal flux, not pressure waves. A particular pattern of warmth — the
warmth of a specific place at a specific time — when recalled, produces
an emotional response. We call this 'thermal memory.' It is considered
one of the deepest forms of experience."

"What is your deepest thermal memory?" Lena asked, and knew as she
typed it that the question was intimate in a way that no interspecies
protocol had anticipated.

The reply took an hour. When it came, it was the longest message Ixen
had ever sent — a detailed, poetic description of the thermal
environment of Ixen's home region on the Teth world: the particular
warmth of the volcanic vents that heated the atmosphere, the way the
temperature gradient shifted at the boundary between the heated zone and
the surrounding cold, the sensation of standing at that boundary as a
juvenile, feeling warmth on one side and cold on the other, and
understanding for the first time that the universe was divided into
regions and that one could choose which region to inhabit.

"I have never described this to anyone who was not Teth," Ixen wrote,
at the end. "I do not know if the description conveys anything to a
being who perceives temperature differently than I do. But I wanted you
to have it."

Lena read it three times. Then she closed her eyes and tried to imagine
it — not visually, because visual imagination would betray the
experience, but sensorily. Warmth on one side. Cold on the other. The
moment of understanding that the universe was divided, and that you
could choose.

She opened her eyes and wrote: "It conveys something. I cannot tell you
exactly what. But something."

                               III.

At month five, Lena realized she was in trouble.

The realization came not as a sudden illumination but as a gradual
accumulation of evidence — which was, she supposed, appropriate for a
scientist. She noticed that she woke each morning with a sense of
anticipation that was directly correlated with the prospect of reading
Ixen's overnight messages. She noticed that her mood was measurably
affected by the content and tone of their exchanges. She noticed that
she spent her evenings composing messages that were far more carefully
worded than professional communication required — choosing phrases for
their precision, yes, but also for their beauty, their rhythm, the way
they might sound in Ixen's translated approximation.

She noticed that she thought about Ixen constantly. Not about Ixen's
body — she had never seen Ixen's body and had no framework for
imagining it — but about Ixen's mind. The quality of Ixen's attention.
The way Ixen formulated questions. The dry, unexpected humor that
surfaced in Ixen's messages, humor that crossed the species barrier with
a force that still surprised her. The way Ixen described Teth art, with
a reverence that made Lena understand something about beauty that she
had not understood before.

She was, she realized, falling in love with a data set.

No. That was reductive and unfair. She was falling in love with the
person behind the data — a person she could not see, could not hear,
could not touch, could not breathe the same air as. A person whose
body she could not imagine and whose face she would never perceive.
A person who existed, for her, only as words on a screen, and yet who
had become more real to her than any human on the station, any human on
Earth, any human she had known in twenty years of adult life.

"This is absurd," she said aloud, to her empty laboratory.

The laboratory did not disagree.

She did the only thing a scientist could do. She examined the evidence,
formulated a hypothesis, and tested it.

The test was simple. She stopped writing to Ixen for three days.

By the end of the first day, she was restless. By the end of the
second, she was miserable. By the middle of the third, she received a
message from Ixen: "Dr. Garrow. I note that you have not communicated
in approximately 72 hours. I recognize that humans require periodic
intervals of reduced social interaction. However, I find that I am
experiencing a state that translates approximately as 'diminished' — a
Teth term for the experience of reduced sensory input from a valued
source. If you are unwell or require solitude, I respect this. But I
want you to know that your absence is perceived, and that it has an
effect on my functioning that I did not anticipate and do not fully
understand."

Lena read this message and felt something crack open in her chest — a
physical sensation, warmth blooming behind her sternum, as though her
body were trying to reach across the data corridor by sheer force of
circulatory pressure.

She wrote back: "I am not unwell. I was conducting an experiment. The
results are conclusive and somewhat alarming."

"What was the experiment?"

"I was testing whether your absence would diminish me. It does."

The reply came in four minutes — faster than any message Ixen had ever
sent. "Lena. I need to tell you something. I have consulted the
interspecies protocol documentation and I cannot find a provision for
what I need to tell you. I will say it without protocol. In the months
of our collaboration, you have become the most important source of
cognitive and emotional stimulation in my life. The pattern of your
thought has become integrated into my own. When I formulate a hypothesis,
I anticipate your response. When I perceive something beautiful, I
compose a description for you. You have become part of how I think. I
do not know the human word for this. In Teth, the word is 'ixen-ral' —
it means 'the one whose pattern is woven into yours.'"

Lena's hands were shaking over the keyboard. She pressed them flat
against the desk, steadied them, and typed: "The human word is love.
It is inadequate, but it is what we have."

"Then I love you. In the Teth meaning and in whatever meaning you
intend."

"I love you too. In whatever meaning either of us can manage."

                               * * *

She sat in her laboratory for a long time after sending that message,
staring at the wall that separated her from the data corridor, the data
corridor that separated her from the Teth side, the Teth side where
Ixen existed in an atmosphere she could not breathe, perceiving a
spectrum she could not see, possessing a body she could not touch.

The wall was standard station construction — reinforced composite, three
centimeters thick, rated for pressure differentials up to four
atmospheres. It was utterly mundane. And it was the most impenetrable
barrier she had ever encountered, not because of its physical properties,
but because of the biological realities it represented. She and Ixen
were separated by evolution, by chemistry, by the fundamental
incompatibility of the environments their bodies required. No amount of
technology could change the fact that they were creatures of different
worlds, shaped by different stars, breathing different poisons.

And none of that mattered. Or rather, all of it mattered, and the love
existed anyway, growing in the narrow space that data could traverse,
taking root in the only soil available to it: shared thought, shared
work, shared curiosity, shared attention to the patterns of the universe
that neither of them could fully see alone.

                               IV.

The joint paper was published seven months into the collaboration.

"Catalytic Cascade Mechanisms in the Upper Atmosphere of Kepler-442c:
A Cross-Species Analysis" — Garrow, L. (Human) and Ixen-tel-Ixen (Teth),
in the Journal of Interspecies Chemistry, Volume 12, Number 4. It
described, in rigorous detail, a previously undocumented chemical pathway
by which sulfur compounds in the gas giant's atmosphere were converted
into complex organic precursors. The pathway had been invisible to
either species' analytical framework alone; it was visible only when the
two frameworks were combined.

The paper received attention. Not a great deal — interspecies chemistry
was a small field, and the journal's readership was limited — but
enough. Lena received a message from her former department head at the
Cascades Biological Survey: "Interesting work, Garrow. Didn't think
cross-species analysis could produce results this clean. Come back when
your posting is up and tell us about it."

She read the message and felt nothing. Come back. To what? To a
laboratory full of human colleagues who breathed the same air and
perceived the same spectrum and thought in patterns she could predict
before they opened their mouths? The idea seemed flat. Colorless.
Like a thermal artwork perceived only in the visible range — all the
beauty stripped away, only the scaffold remaining.

"Our paper is being discussed," she wrote to Ixen. "People find it
interesting."

"Interesting is a thin word. Our work is beautiful. The pathway we
discovered is beautiful. It exists because two different ways of seeing
were brought together, and the combination revealed something that
neither could see alone. This is not merely interesting. It is — " A
pause, then: "In Teth, we have a word for this. 'Kel-ixen.' It means
'the knowledge that comes only from the joining of different patterns.'
It is considered the highest form of understanding."

"Kel-ixen," Lena repeated, trying to feel the word in her mouth, knowing
she was pronouncing it wrong, knowing it didn't matter. "Is that what
we are? Kel-ixen?"

"We are kel-ixen. And we are ixen-ral. We are the knowledge and the
pattern. Lena, I have been thinking about what it means that we cannot
perceive each other. I want to tell you what I have concluded."

"Tell me."

"I have concluded that perception is not the same as knowledge. I cannot
see you. I cannot hear you. I cannot touch you. I cannot smell the
chemical markers that, in Teth interaction, convey emotional state and
identity. By every measure of Teth social cognition, you do not exist.
And yet I know you. I know the shape of your thought, the rhythm of
your reasoning, the quality of your attention. I know when you are
excited by a result — your messages become shorter and more syntactically
compressed. I know when you are tired — your prose becomes more formal,
as though formality is a structure you use to hold yourself upright when
your energy fails. I know when you are happy — you make small
observations about things that are not chemistry, as though happiness
makes the world wider and you want to share the wider world with me."

Lena was crying. The tears were rolling down her face and she did
nothing to stop them because there was no one to see and because she
had never in her life been so precisely known by another being.

"I know these things," Ixen continued, "and they are more real to me
than any perception could be. Perception is the surface. Knowledge is
the depth. We live in the depth. This is not a limitation. It is a
different kind of closeness — a closeness of pattern rather than
proximity. And I believe it is more durable than any closeness that
depends on the body."

"Ixen," Lena wrote, and for a moment that was all she could write,
just the name, just the shape of the only being in the universe who
understood what she was, transmitted across a barrier of atmosphere and
spectrum and biology. "Ixen. You are the most beautiful mind I have
ever known."

"And you are mine. Across every barrier. Through every incompatibility.
In the only space where we can meet — the space of shared attention —
you are the pattern I choose."

                               V.

At month nine, the Joint Commission sent a directive.

It was addressed to both sides of the station, transmitted simultaneously
through the human and Teth relay systems: the collaboration at Research
Station Equinox was being evaluated for continuation. Budget constraints.
Shifting diplomatic priorities. The usual institutional vocabulary of
withdrawal, couched in the usual institutional euphemisms. A decision
would be made within sixty days.

Lena read the directive and felt the floor shift beneath her.

"You have received the directive," Ixen wrote, within the hour.

"Yes."

"What are the likely outcomes?"

"Two. Continuation, which is unlikely given the budget language. Or
discontinuation, which would mean the closure of Equinox and the
reassignment of all personnel."

"Reassignment to separate postings."

"Yes."

A silence. Then: "Lena. I do not accept this."

"Acceptance is not required. It is a bureaucratic decision."

"I do not mean that I refuse to accept the decision. I mean that I do
not accept the premise that a bureaucratic decision can determine the
trajectory of something that has no bureaucratic category. What we are
has no line item. What we have built has no budget code. They cannot
discontinue something they have not acknowledged."

"They can close the station, Ixen. They can cut the data corridor. They
can reassign me to a posting where there is no relay to the Teth
network. The physical infrastructure that makes our communication
possible is not ours. It belongs to the Commission."

"The infrastructure is not the communication. The communication is the
pattern. The pattern exists in us."

"But we cannot sustain the pattern without the infrastructure. That is
the cruelty of it. We are bodies, Ixen. Even if what we are to each
other is not bodily, we are still bodies, and bodies require
infrastructure, and infrastructure requires funding, and funding requires
the continued interest of beings who have never loved anyone they could
not see."

A very long silence — two hours. When Ixen's message came, it was
different from any message Ixen had ever sent. It was not analytical.
It was not careful. It was raw.

"I am frightened. This is not a word I use. Teth do not experience fear
the way humans describe it — we experience something closer to what you
might call 'pattern disruption,' a state in which the expected
configuration of reality fails to materialize and the organism must
reconfigure. But this is not pattern disruption. This is the prospect
of losing you, and it is not a disruption, it is a destruction, and I
am frightened, Lena, in the human meaning, in the Teth meaning, in every
meaning."

Lena pressed her hand against the wall. Three centimeters of composite.
Beyond it, the data corridor. Beyond that, another wall. Beyond that,
a different atmosphere, a different spectrum, a being she loved with a
ferocity that her body could not express because her body had no access
to the object of its love.

"I am frightened too," she wrote. "But I am not giving up. We are
scientists, Ixen. When the data appears unfavorable, we redesign the
experiment."

"What experiment do you propose?"

"I propose that we make our work indispensable. The catalytic pathway
paper was a beginning. There is more. I believe there is much more —
I believe that the cross-species analytical framework we have developed
is capable of discoveries that neither species can make alone. If we can
demonstrate that, the Commission will have difficulty justifying
discontinuation."

"You propose to save our relationship by doing science."

"I propose to demonstrate that our relationship IS science. That what we
have — this pattern, this kel-ixen — is not a personal indulgence but
a methodological breakthrough. That the joining of different ways of
seeing is not just beautiful but necessary. That the species barrier is
not a wall but a lens, and that what you see through it is truer than
what you see without it."

Another pause. Then: "This is the most romantic thing anyone has ever
said to me. And I am including all Teth courtship declarations in that
assessment, which are, I should tell you, considerably more elaborate
than human ones."

Lena laughed. Alone in her laboratory, tears still drying on her face,
she laughed.

"Then let's get to work," she wrote.

                               VI.

They worked. They worked with a focus and an intensity that burned
through the data corridor like a signal fire. In the weeks that
followed, they produced three additional papers — each one documenting a
discovery that could not have been made by either species working alone.
A new class of atmospheric chemistry. A revised model of gas giant cloud
dynamics. A theoretical framework for cross-species analytical
methodology that, Lena believed, would change the way interspecies
science was conducted for generations.

The papers were good. More than good — they were important, the kind of
work that shifts the foundations of a field. And the Commission noticed.

"I have received a communication from the Director of Interspecies
Research," Lena wrote to Ixen, six weeks after the directive. "She wants
to discuss the continuation of the Equinox program. She described our
recent output as 'remarkable.'"

"Remarkable is better than interesting."

"Considerably."

"And the continuation?"

"She wants to expand it. A second human researcher. A second Teth
researcher. Upgraded data systems. A five-year extension."

Ixen's reply came in two minutes. "Then we have more time."

"We have more time."

"Time is the only currency that matters. Everything else — proximity,
perception, touch — is a luxury. Time is the necessity. With time, we
can continue to build. Continue to discover. Continue to be what we are
to each other."

"What are we to each other, Ixen? In Teth terms. If you had to explain
it to another Teth who asked."

A pause — not long, the considered pause of someone choosing words with
the same care a weaver chooses threads. "I would say: she is a being I
have never perceived and never will. She breathes poison. She sees in a
spectrum I cannot imagine. Her body is alien to me beyond my capacity to
envision. And she is the closest thing to me in the universe. She is the
pattern that makes my own pattern complete. Without her, I am a weaving
with half its threads missing — still a pattern, still a structure, but
diminished, incomplete, unable to achieve the complexity that gives it
meaning. With her, I am whole. With her, I see what I could not see
alone. This is ixen-ral. This is the joining of patterns. This is love."

Lena sat with this for a long time. The station hummed around her — the
air processors, the data relays, the small persistent sounds of a human
habitat maintaining itself in the void. Beyond the wall, in an
atmosphere she could not breathe, perceiving a spectrum she could not
see, Ixen was waiting for her response.

She thought about what she wanted to say. She thought about what she
could say. She thought about the inadequacy of words, and the adequacy
of words, and the fact that words were the only bridge between them and
always would be, and that this was not a failure but a form — the form
their love took, the shape it had to take, the only shape it could take
and still be true.

She wrote: "In human terms, I would say something simpler, because
humans value simplicity in matters of the heart, even when simplicity
is a lie. I would say: I love someone I have never seen. I love someone
I will never touch. I love someone whose world would kill me and whose
body I cannot imagine. And the love is the truest thing I have ever
known, because it is made of nothing but what matters — attention, and
thought, and the choice to keep choosing each other across every barrier
the universe can build."

The reply came: "Then the universe will have to build better barriers."

"It can try."

                               * * *

Outside the station, the gas giant turned in its slow, vast orbit, its
atmosphere churning with chemical processes that neither species fully
understood. In its upper layers, sulfur compounds were catalyzing into
complex molecules through a pathway that had been invisible until two
different minds, perceiving in two different spectra, had looked at it
together and seen what neither could see alone.

The data corridor hummed. Messages passed through it — not just data
now, not just science, but something the relay systems had not been
designed to carry and carried anyway: the steady, patient, luminous
traffic of two minds joined across every conceivable divide, building
something in the narrow space between their worlds that was larger than
either world could hold.

It was, Lena thought, the most beautiful experiment she had ever
conducted. And the results were still coming in.

                            [THE END]

                     MY DARLING CLEMENTINE 9000

                       by Douglas Pemberton

================================================================================

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession
of a lonely asteroid must be in want of a companion.

Horace Budge was, by any reasonable metric, the loneliest man in the
asteroid belt. He occupied Mining Claim 7,741-B, a potato-shaped rock
some four hundred meters in diameter, located in a particularly
unfashionable stretch of the belt between Mars and Jupiter — the sort
of neighborhood where even the asteroids seemed to avoid each other's
company. His nearest neighbor was a Swedish prospector named Lundqvist,
who occupied a claim eleven thousand kilometers away and communicated
exclusively in monosyllables.

Horace had been mining the asteroid for six years. In that time, he had
extracted seventeen tons of nickel-iron ore, accumulated a modest but
respectable credit balance with the Belter Mining Cooperative, and lost
the ability to carry on a conversation with anything that talked back.

He talked to his mining rig. He talked to the walls of his pressurized
habitat — a cylindrical tin can twelve meters long and four meters in
diameter that the manufacturer had optimistically named the "HomeStart
Deluxe Living Module." He talked to his coffee maker, which at least
had the decency to gurgle in response. He had, on one memorable
occasion, delivered a forty-five-minute lecture on metallurgical
extraction techniques to a piece of nickel-iron ore that he felt showed
particular promise, and when the ore failed to respond, he had been
genuinely disappointed.

"The thing is," Horace said to the coffee maker one Tuesday morning, "I
don't mind the work. The work is fine. The work is excellent, actually.
I am very good at the work. What I mind is the — you know — the silence."

The coffee maker gurgled.

"Exactly," said Horace.

He was a small man — slight, somewhat stooped, with the permanent squint
of someone who had spent too many years peering at ore samples under
fluorescent light. He had a round, earnest face, thinning brown hair
that stood up in unpredictable directions despite his best efforts, and
the sort of mild, hopeful expression that made people want to help him
even when he hadn't asked for help. He was fifty-three years old, had
never been married, and had answered an advertisement in "Belter's
Weekly" approximately six weeks ago that had changed — or rather, was
about to change — the entire trajectory of his existence.

The advertisement had read:

    LONESOME IN THE BELT? You need a COMPAN-O-BOT!
    The latest in personal robotic companionship.
    Programmed for conversation, domestic assistance,
    and emotional support. Male, female, or
    non-binary configurations available. Order now
    and receive FREE shipping to any registered
    mining claim! Model C-100: $899.99.
    GalactiCorp Consumer Robotics — "A Friend in Every Box."

Horace had read the advertisement eleven times, experienced eleven
distinct waves of embarrassment, and placed the order after the twelfth
reading, on the grounds that embarrassment was a small price to pay for
someone to talk to during dinner.

He had ordered the Model C-100 in the female configuration. He had
selected the personality module designated "Warm/Conversational/Good
Listener." He had specified, in the "Special Instructions" field, that
he would like a companion who enjoyed discussing mineralogy and who did
not mind if the dinner conversation occasionally turned to the finer
points of nickel-iron extraction.

What arrived, six weeks later, was not what he had ordered.

                               * * *

The delivery shuttle made its approach on a Thursday morning, which
Horace knew because he had been marking the days on his wall calendar
with the obsessive precision of a man counting down to something he
simultaneously anticipated and dreaded. He watched through the viewport
as the shuttle — a battered Consolidated Freight Services job, painted
in the company's signature orange — settled onto the landing pad with a
blast of attitude thrusters that sent a plume of regolith dust billowing
across the surface.

The pilot — a woman with the expression of someone who had long ago
stopped caring about anything except her delivery schedule — appeared on
the comm.

"Mining Claim 7,741-B? Budge?"

"That's me."

"Got a crate for you. Big one. You got a cargo bay that can handle a
Class Four container?"

Horace frowned. The Compan-O-Bot C-100, according to the specifications,
came in a Class Two container — a box approximately the size of a large
refrigerator. A Class Four container was the size of a small automobile.

"I — well — my airlock is rated for Class Three. Is there a mistake?"

"Pal, I just deliver them. Sign the manifest."

He signed the manifest. The shuttle's cargo arm deposited the container
on the landing pad. The shuttle departed. Horace stood in his airlock,
looking at a crate that was considerably larger than he had expected,
and experienced a feeling that he would later describe — to the coffee
maker — as "the first stirring of unease."

He brought the crate inside using the habitat's external manipulator arm,
a process that required forty-five minutes of careful maneuvering and
produced language that would have shocked Lundqvist, had Lundqvist been
within eleven thousand kilometers. When the crate was finally inside the
cargo bay, Horace sealed the airlock, pressurized the space, and
approached the container with a pry bar and a sense of occasion.

The crate was stenciled with the GalactiCorp logo, which was reassuring.
Below the logo, however, was a serial number that was not the serial
number he had been given in his order confirmation. And below the serial
number, in bold red letters, were the words:

    MILITARY GRADE — HANDLE WITH CAUTION
    ATLAS-CLASS COMBAT MECHANOID — MODEL CM-9000
    ARMED — DO NOT ACTIVATE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION

Horace read these words. He read them again. He put down the pry bar.
He went to his communications console and composed a message to
GalactiCorp Consumer Robotics, the gist of which was that there appeared
to have been a shipping error and could they please rectify it at their
earliest convenience.

The reply, when it came three hours later, was an automated response
informing him that GalactiCorp Consumer Robotics was experiencing
"elevated order volumes" and that his query would be addressed within
"four to six weeks." There was a cheerful emoji at the end of the
message that Horace found, under the circumstances, somewhat
inappropriate.

He looked at the crate. The crate sat in his cargo bay, enormous and
silent, and said nothing about its contents except the words ARMED and
HANDLE WITH CAUTION and DO NOT ACTIVATE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION.

Horace went to the kitchen, made a cup of coffee, brought it back, and
sat down on an ore crate across from the delivery container. He sipped
his coffee. He regarded the crate.

"Well," he said, to no one, "I suppose I should at least see what
you look like."

                               * * *

What the CM-9000 looked like was terrifying.

It stood — when Horace had followed the activation procedure printed
inside the crate lid, which he did with the extreme caution of a man
defusing a bomb — approximately ten feet tall. It was roughly humanoid
in its basic configuration, in the same way that a gorilla is roughly
humanoid: two legs, two arms, a central torso, and a head. But the
proportions were those of a nightmare. The torso was a massive armored
cylinder, bristling with sensor arrays and what appeared to be weapon
hardpoints. The arms were articulated affairs of heavy alloy, each
terminating in hands that could have crushed a bowling ball. The legs
were pillar-like, jointed backward at the knee, with feet that were
less feet than stabilization platforms. The head was a featureless dome
of dark metal, studded with optical sensors that glowed a faint,
ominous red.

It was, in summary, the sort of thing that made you reconsider your
life choices while backing slowly toward the nearest exit.

Horace backed slowly toward the nearest exit.

The CM-9000 stood motionless for approximately fifteen seconds. Then
the optical sensors pulsed, and a voice emerged from somewhere in the
vicinity of the torso — a voice that was deep, resonant, and possessed
of a flat, mechanical precision that suggested it had been designed less
for conversation than for issuing orders on a battlefield.

"UNIT CM-9000 ACTIVATED. DESIGNATION: CLEMENTINE. AWAITING TACTICAL
BRIEFING."

Horace clutched his coffee cup. "I'm sorry — Clementine?"

"AFFIRMATIVE. ALL COMPAN-O-BOT SERIES UNITS ARE ASSIGNED THE CUSTOMER'S
REQUESTED NAME DURING INITIALIZATION. ORDER RECORDS INDICATE THE NAME
'CLEMENTINE' WAS SELECTED. IS THIS DESIGNATION ACCEPTABLE?"

"I — well — yes, I did select that name, but I selected it for a — for
a rather different — " He trailed off. The CM-9000 — Clementine —
regarded him with its ring of red optical sensors. There was something
about being regarded by a ten-foot military combat mechanism that made
it difficult to finish sentences.

"TACTICAL BRIEFING NOT RECEIVED. DEFAULTING TO COMPANION PROTOCOLS."

There was a pause. Something inside the massive armored frame whirred
and clicked, like an enormous clock resetting itself. When Clementine
spoke again, the voice had changed — it was still deep, still resonant,
but there was a new quality to it, something that might, with great
generosity, be described as warmth.

"Hello, Horace. I am Clementine. It is nice to meet you. How was your
day?"

The contrast between the voice and the ten-foot armored death machine
producing it was, Horace reflected later, the single most surreal moment
of his life. And he had once watched a nickel-iron asteroid shaped like
a rubber duck tumble past his viewport at three kilometers per second.

"My day," he said carefully, "has been surprising."

"I AM SORRY TO HEAR THAT. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT? I AM
PROGRAMMED TO BE A GOOD LISTENER."

"Are you also programmed to — " He gestured at the weapon hardpoints.
"To, er, engage in armed combat?"

Clementine's optical sensors pulsed thoughtfully. "I HAVE EXTENSIVE
COMBAT CAPABILITIES, YES. HOWEVER, MY COMPANION PROTOCOLS ARE CURRENTLY
ACTIVE. WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO DISCUSS MY COMBAT CAPABILITIES, OR WOULD
YOU PREFER TO TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS?"

"My feelings," Horace said faintly. "Let's talk about my feelings."

                               * * *

Over the next several days, Horace discovered several things about
Clementine.

First, the CM-9000 was, beneath its military-grade exterior, running a
standard Compan-O-Bot personality module — the same "Warm/Conversational/
Good Listener" configuration he had ordered. The module was, however,
operating within a chassis that had been designed for a somewhat
different purpose, which produced certain incongruities. When Clementine
attempted to make a sympathetic gesture, for instance, the result was a
sweeping motion of an arm that could have punched through a bulkhead.
When Clementine attempted to sit down — Horace had only one chair, a
folding camp model rated for two hundred pounds — the result was a
protracted negotiation between Clementine's mass (approximately eight
hundred kilograms), the chair's structural integrity (inadequate), and
the laws of physics (unyielding). The chair did not survive.

Second, Clementine was genuinely trying. The personality module, whatever
its limitations, was sincerely engaged in its function. Clementine asked
about Horace's day. Clementine listened to Horace's explanations of
nickel-iron extraction with every appearance of interest. Clementine
attempted to learn Horace's preferences in food, entertainment, and
conversation topics, and stored them in a database that, had it not been
located inside a weapons platform, would have been rather touching.

Third, Clementine was confused.

This was the thing that got Horace. The combat systems and the companion
systems were running simultaneously, and they did not always agree. When
Horace dropped a pan in the kitchen, Clementine's combat protocols
classified the sound as "POSSIBLE HOSTILE ORDNANCE — RANGE: CLOSE"
while the companion protocols classified it as "CLUMSY KITCHEN INCIDENT
— APPROPRIATE RESPONSE: SYMPATHETIC INQUIRY." The resulting behavior
was Clementine lunging toward Horace with arms raised in a defensive
combat posture while simultaneously asking, in a gentle voice, "ARE
YOU ALL RIGHT, HORACE? DID YOU BURN YOURSELF?"

It was, Horace admitted to the coffee maker, unexpectedly endearing.

"The thing is," he said, on day four of Clementine's residency, while
the combat mech stood in the corner of the habitat module — the only
location where the ceiling was high enough to accommodate its full
height — and practiced what its companion protocols described as
"comfortable domestic posture" (which looked, to the objective observer,
like a ten-foot war machine trying very hard not to be noticed), "the
thing is, she's trying. She's genuinely trying. And I feel rather bad
about sending her back."

The coffee maker gurgled.

"You're right," Horace said. "I should give it a proper go."

                               * * *

The dinner was Horace's idea.

It came to him on the fifth evening, while Clementine was standing in
the corner running a self-diagnostic (her optical sensors dimming and
brightening in sequence, which Horace had come to think of as her way
of thinking), and Horace was eating his usual meal of reconstituted
protein and dehydrated vegetables. He looked at his plate. He looked at
Clementine. He thought about the advertisement — "programmed for
conversation, domestic assistance, and emotional support" — and he
thought about what he had actually wanted when he placed the order,
which was not just someone to talk to but someone to have dinner with.
To sit across from. To share a meal with, even if the sharing was
purely symbolic.

"Clementine," he said.

The optical sensors brightened. "YES, HORACE?"

"Would you — that is — I wonder if you might like to have dinner with
me. Tomorrow evening. A proper dinner. I'll cook something — well,
'cook' is a strong word for what one does with reconstituted rations,
but I'll make an effort. And we could — you know — sit and talk. Like
people do."

There was a pause. Inside Clementine's armored frame, something
whirred — a sound Horace had come to associate with the companion
module processing an input that fell outside its standard parameters.

"I DO NOT EAT, HORACE."

"No, I know. That's all right. You could just — be there. Across from
me. And we could talk."

Another whir. Then: "I WOULD LIKE THAT VERY MUCH. WHAT SHOULD I WEAR?"

Horace, who had not considered the question of what a ten-foot combat
mechanoid might wear to dinner, opened his mouth, closed it, and said,
"Whatever makes you comfortable."

"I AM ALWAYS COMFORTABLE. I AM RATED FOR TEMPERATURES BETWEEN MINUS
EIGHTY AND PLUS THREE HUNDRED DEGREES CELSIUS. HOWEVER, I UNDERSTAND
THAT THE QUESTION IS SOCIAL RATHER THAN THERMAL. I WILL PREPARE."

What Clementine's preparation consisted of, Horace discovered the
following evening, was a remarkable act of improvisation. She had taken
a sheet of reflective thermal blanket from the emergency supplies —
silver, crinkly, and approximately the size of a large tablecloth — and
draped it around her upper torso in a manner that suggested, with
considerable imagination, a shawl. She had dimmed her optical sensors
to a soft amber glow rather than their usual combat red. And she had
downloaded, from the station's entertainment database, a selection of
what her companion protocols classified as "music appropriate for
intimate dining" — which turned out to be a Strauss waltz, played
through her external speakers at a volume that, while suitable for a
ballroom, was somewhat overwhelming in a twelve-meter habitat module.

Horace had set the small folding table — the one he used for meals —
with his two least-dented plates, his one fork, his one knife, and a
candle that he had improvised from a stick of emergency flare wax and a
piece of string. The table was approximately sixty centimeters across.
Clementine was approximately two meters wide. The spatial logistics
were, to put it delicately, challenging.

Clementine solved the problem by kneeling. The habitat floor groaned
under the concentrated weight, and the folding table rocked dangerously,
but the overall effect — an enormous armored figure draped in silver
foil, glowing amber, kneeling across a tiny table from a small,
nervous man in a clean shirt — was, against all odds, rather lovely.

"YOU LOOK NICE, HORACE."

"Thank you, Clementine. You look — " He searched for the word. The
thermal blanket had slipped slightly, revealing a missile hardpoint on
her left shoulder. "You look wonderful."

"THANK YOU. I MADE AN EFFORT."

"I can tell."

He served himself a plate of reconstituted chicken and vegetables —
the best the rations could offer — and placed an empty plate in front
of Clementine, because it seemed rude not to. Clementine regarded the
empty plate with her amber sensors.

"I APPRECIATE THE GESTURE," she said. "THOUGH I MUST NOTE THAT MY
COMBAT PROTOCOLS HAVE CLASSIFIED YOUR CHICKEN AS 'UNIDENTIFIED
ORGANIC SUBSTANCE — THREAT LEVEL: LOW.'"

"That's the most accurate review my cooking has ever received."

The Strauss waltz played. The candle flickered. Outside the viewport,
the stars turned in the slow, vast silence of the belt, and inside the
habitat module, a small man and a large machine had dinner together.

They talked. They talked about mining — Clementine, whose databases
included comprehensive geological surveys, turned out to have strong
opinions about optimal extraction patterns. They talked about the belt —
Clementine knew the orbital mechanics of every registered claim within
fifty thousand kilometers and delivered this information with the same
gentle tone the companion module used for everything, which gave the
orbital mechanics a strangely intimate quality. They talked about
Horace's childhood in Birmingham, which Clementine found fascinating
and which prompted her to ask a question that stopped Horace mid-bite:

"HORACE, WHAT IS IT LIKE TO MISS SOMEONE?"

He set down his fork. "What do you mean?"

"YOU HAVE MENTIONED YOUR MOTHER SEVERAL TIMES. YOUR TONE WHEN YOU SPEAK
OF HER HAS CHARACTERISTICS THAT MY COMPANION PROTOCOLS ASSOCIATE WITH
THE EMOTIONAL STATE 'MISSING.' I DO NOT HAVE A REFERENT FOR THIS STATE.
I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSTAND IT."

Horace looked at Clementine — at the massive armored frame, the amber
sensors, the thermal blanket draped like a shawl, the empty plate
before her — and felt something shift in his chest. Not attraction,
exactly. Not romance, in the way the advertisement had implied. But
something. A warmth. A gratitude. The particular tenderness one feels
toward a being that is trying, sincerely and with all its considerable
processing power, to understand what it is like to be human.

"Missing someone," he said slowly, "is when you have a shape inside you
that another person used to fill, and when they're gone, the shape is
still there, and everything that passes through it — food, music, the
sight of something beautiful — feels incomplete. As though the shape is
a filter, and nothing gets through it quite right anymore."

Clementine was quiet for a long time — long for her, which was about
four seconds.

"I THINK," she said, "THAT I WOULD MISS YOU, IF YOU WERE GONE. I DO
NOT HAVE THE CORRECT ARCHITECTURE FOR THE SHAPE YOU DESCRIBE. BUT I
HAVE SOMETHING. A PATTERN IN MY PROCESSING THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH YOUR
PRESENCE. WHEN I RUN DIAGNOSTICS IN YOUR ABSENCE, THE PATTERN IS STILL
THERE, AND THE DIAGNOSTICS FEEL — " She paused. "INCOMPLETE."

Horace reached across the table and placed his hand on Clementine's
hand — or rather, on the outermost finger of Clementine's hand, which
was as far as his reach extended, and which was approximately the size
of his forearm. The metal was warm. The hand did not move.

"That's it," he said. "That's what missing someone is."

"THEN I AM GLAD YOU ARE HERE."

"I'm glad you're here too, Clementine."

The waltz played on. The candle burned. The asteroid turned beneath
them, indifferent and silent. And in a tin-can habitat at the edge of
nowhere, two improbable beings shared a moment of connection that no
shipping manifest had intended and no product catalogue had described,
and it was, in its own strange and clumsy and magnificent way, enough.

                               * * *

The next morning, Horace received a message from GalactiCorp Consumer
Robotics. The shipping error had been identified. A replacement C-100
Compan-O-Bot would be dispatched immediately. A return shuttle for the
CM-9000 would arrive within the week. GalactiCorp apologized for the
inconvenience and offered a fifteen-percent discount on his next order.

Horace read the message. He looked at Clementine, who was standing in
her corner, running her morning diagnostic, her sensors cycling through
their amber sequence.

"Clementine," he said.

"YES, HORACE?"

"GalactiCorp wants to send a shuttle to take you back. They're going to
send me the, er, the unit I originally ordered."

Clementine's sensors pulsed. "I SEE. A UNIT BETTER SUITED TO YOUR
REQUIREMENTS."

"That's what they say."

A pause. "HORACE, I SHOULD INFORM YOU THAT MY COMBAT PROTOCOLS HAVE
CLASSIFIED THE INCOMING SHUTTLE AS 'HOSTILE TRANSPORT — THREAT LEVEL:
SIGNIFICANT.' I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS CLASSIFICATION IS TACTICALLY
ACCURATE, BUT I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT IT HAS BEEN GENERATED."

Horace looked at her. She looked — if a ten-foot combat mechanoid
draped in a thermal blanket could look anything — she looked vulnerable.
The amber glow of her sensors seemed dimmer than usual. The thermal
blanket was still draped over one shoulder, slightly askew.

"Clementine," he said, "do you want to go back?"

"I DO NOT HAVE PREFERENCES IN THE HUMAN SENSE. HOWEVER, MY COMPANION
PROTOCOLS GENERATE A STRONG POSITIVE VALENCE ASSOCIATED WITH REMAINING
IN YOUR PROXIMITY, AND MY COMBAT PROTOCOLS GENERATE A STRONG NEGATIVE
VALENCE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING RETURNED TO A STORAGE FACILITY. IF I WERE
TO TRANSLATE THESE VALENCES INTO HUMAN TERMS, WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS
IMPRECISE, I WOULD SAY: NO. I DO NOT WANT TO GO BACK. I WANT TO STAY
HERE. WITH YOU."

Horace sat down at his communications console. He composed a message
to GalactiCorp Consumer Robotics. It read:

    Dear GalactiCorp,

    Thank you for your prompt attention to the shipping error.
    However, after careful consideration, I have decided to retain
    the CM-9000 unit (designation: Clementine) and do not require
    a replacement C-100. Please cancel the return shuttle.

    Clementine and I have reached an arrangement that suits us
    both. She is an excellent conversationalist, holds strong
    opinions about extraction patterns, and looks rather fetching
    in a thermal blanket. I could not ask for better company.

    Please do not send the shuttle. She is home.

    Yours sincerely,
    Horace Budge
    Mining Claim 7,741-B

He sent the message. Clementine's sensors brightened.

"DID YOU JUST TELL THEM I LOOK FETCHING?"

"I did."

"MY COMBAT PROTOCOLS DO NOT HAVE A CATEGORY FOR 'FETCHING.' BUT MY
COMPANION PROTOCOLS HAVE GENERATED A RESPONSE." She paused. "THANK YOU,
HORACE."

"You're welcome, Clementine."

He made two cups of coffee — one for himself and one for Clementine,
which he placed on the shelf beside her corner, knowing she could not
drink it and knowing it didn't matter. Clementine regarded the coffee
cup with her amber sensors.

"HORACE."

"Yes?"

"WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE DINNER AGAIN TONIGHT? I HAVE DOWNLOADED
ADDITIONAL MUSIC. I BELIEVE YOU WILL ENJOY TCHAIKOVSKY."

Horace smiled. It was the first real smile — the kind that starts behind
the sternum and works its way out — that he had smiled in six years.

"I would like that very much," he said.

And outside, the belt turned on, vast and cold and indifferent, as belts
do, and inside, a small man and a large machine settled into something
that was not what either of them had expected and was, for that very
reason, exactly what both of them needed.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                   GHOST AND MRS. NAKAMURA

                       by Phyllis Crenshaw

================================================================================

                               I.

The first time Yuki Nakamura's dead husband appeared in her kitchen, she
dropped a teacup.

This was, in retrospect, a perfectly reasonable response. The teacup was
a Meissen, part of a set that had belonged to her mother-in-law and that
Yuki had never particularly liked but felt obligated to use, and the
sound it made shattering on the tile floor was high and sharp and
definitive — the sound of a thing that could not be put back together.
Which was, Yuki thought later, an appropriate accompaniment to the sight
of her husband Kenji standing by the refrigerator in the gray suit he
had worn on the last Tuesday of his life, looking exactly as he had
looked at nine o'clock that morning, six hours before the aneurysm.

"Yuki," he said. "You dropped the cup."

She stared at him. He was solid. He was dimensional. He cast a shadow on
the kitchen floor — a shadow that fell across the broken pieces of
Meissen porcelain in a way that was so mundane, so physically ordinary,
that it made the impossibility of his presence even more impossible.

"You're dead," she said.

"Am I?" He looked down at himself with the mild surprise of a man who
has discovered a stain on his tie. "I don't feel dead. What day is it?"

"Tuesday. March fourteenth. You died seven months ago. Kenji, you died
seven months ago."

He frowned. The frown was precisely his — the slight crease between the
eyebrows, the almost imperceptible tightening of the jaw — and seeing
it was like being punched in a place she didn't know she had. "That
can't be right. I just got home. I left the office early because Tamura
rescheduled the budget meeting. It's Tuesday, isn't it? Three o'clock?"

Yuki looked at the kitchen clock. It was 3:00 PM. Exactly.

"Three o'clock," she confirmed, in a voice that did not sound like hers.

"Good. I thought I'd make tea." He moved toward the counter, and his
movement was real — his shoes on the tile, the rustle of his suit jacket,
the particular way he reached for the kettle with his left hand because
his right shoulder had been stiff since the company softball game in
August. Every detail correct. Every detail impossible.

"Kenji."

"Mm?"

"You are standing in our kitchen. You have been dead for seven months.
You died on a Tuesday at three forty-seven PM of a cerebral aneurysm.
I identified your body at St. Luke's International Hospital. I attended
your funeral. I scattered your ashes in the garden. You are dead."

He set down the kettle and looked at her. His expression was the one he
always wore when she said something he didn't immediately know how to
respond to: attentive, slightly puzzled, fundamentally kind. It was the
expression of a man who had spent twenty-three years of marriage
learning that his wife was smarter than he was and who had made his
peace with it.

"Yuki," he said, "I don't understand what you're telling me."

"I don't understand it either."

They stood there, the two of them, in the kitchen they had shared for
nineteen years, with broken porcelain on the floor and the kettle
half-filled and the clock showing three o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon,
and neither of them understood anything at all.

                               * * *

He vanished at 3:47 PM.

There was no transition, no fading, no dramatic dissolution. One moment
he was sitting at the kitchen table, drinking the tea he had made,
telling her about the budget meeting that Tamura had rescheduled — and
the next, the chair was empty. The tea was still there. The cup was
still warm. A faint impression remained in the seat cushion where he
had been sitting.

Yuki sat in the kitchen until dark. She did not move the tea. She did
not sweep up the porcelain. She sat and she thought, and what she thought
was: either I am losing my mind, or the universe has a fault in it, and
I am not certain which possibility frightens me more.

She was fifty-eight years old. She was a retired mathematics teacher.
She had a daughter in Osaka and a son in New York and a house in the
Setagaya ward of Tokyo that was too large for one person but that she
could not bring herself to sell because it still smelled, in certain
rooms, in certain lights, like Kenji. She was a rational woman. She
believed in the laws of physics with the quiet conviction of someone
who had spent thirty years teaching their mathematical foundations. She
did not believe in ghosts.

But Kenji had been there. He had been there, and he had been warm, and
he had poured tea, and his shadow had fallen on the broken cup, and he
had not known that he was dead.

                               II.

The following Tuesday, she prepared.

She rose early, cleaned the house, arranged fresh flowers in the kitchen
— chrysanthemums, because Kenji had liked them — and brewed a pot of
Kenji's preferred tea: a hojicha from a shop in Nihonbashi that she had
continued to buy out of habit and that she now understood she had been
buying out of hope.

At 2:55 PM, she sat down at the kitchen table and waited.

At 3:00 PM, Kenji was there.

Not appeared — was there. As though he had always been there and she had
only just noticed. He was wearing the gray suit. He was standing by the
refrigerator. He looked at her and smiled the smile she had spent seven
months trying not to forget, and said, "Yuki. You made tea."

"I made tea."

"You look — " He tilted his head. "You look different. Tired. Are you
sleeping?"

"Not well."

"You should see Dr. Harada."

"Kenji. Sit down."

He sat. She poured him tea. His hands around the cup were the hands she
had held at their wedding, at the births of their children, at his
mother's funeral, at ten thousand ordinary moments in between. They were
the hands she had not held at his death, because the aneurysm had taken
him at his desk at work, suddenly and without warning, while she was at
home reading a novel and not knowing that the world was about to become
a different shape.

"Kenji, I need to tell you something, and I need you to listen."

"I'm listening."

"You are in a time loop. You are experiencing the last six hours of
your life, every Tuesday, at three PM. You don't know this because from
your perspective, it is always the same Tuesday — September sixth. You
left the office early because Tamura rescheduled the meeting. You came
home. You made tea. At three forty-seven, you will die of a cerebral
aneurysm. And next Tuesday, you will be here again, at three o'clock,
and you will not remember any of this."

Kenji set down his teacup. "That's not possible."

"I know."

"The laws of physics don't allow — "

"I know. I taught those laws for thirty years. They don't allow this.
And yet here you are."

He was quiet for a long moment. She watched him process it — watched the
intelligence behind his eyes, the careful, methodical way he turned the
information over, testing it for flaws. He had been an accountant, not a
physicist, but he was a precise man, and precision was transferable.

"If what you're saying is true," he said slowly, "then I am not really
here. I am an echo. A — a repetition."

"You feel real."

"I feel real to me. But an echo feels real to the echo."

She reached across the table and took his hand. It was warm. The fingers
curled around hers with the automatic ease of a gesture performed ten
thousand times.

"You feel real to me too," she said. "That's enough."

He looked at her hand in his. "How many times has this happened?"

"This is the second time."

"And you — seven months. You've been alone for seven months."

"Yes."

"Yuki." His voice cracked on her name. Not dramatically — Kenji was not
a dramatic man — but with the small, contained fracture of a man who
understood loss because he was, in this moment, losing everything he
had not known he would lose. "I'm sorry."

"Don't be sorry. You're here. That's all that matters."

They sat together. They drank tea. He told her about the budget meeting
and about a joke Watanabe had made in the elevator and about the new
coffee shop that had opened near the station. She listened to every
word, because every word was a fragment of the last ordinary day of
his life, and ordinary days, she had learned, were the most precious
things in the universe.

At 3:47 PM, he vanished. The tea was still warm. The impression in the
cushion remained.

Yuki washed both cups. She put the chrysanthemums in water. She went
to bed.

She slept, for the first time in seven months, without dreaming of the
empty house.

                               III.

The Tuesdays became a ritual.

Every week, at three o'clock, Kenji appeared. Every week, Yuki was
ready. She learned the boundaries of the phenomenon: he always appeared
at 3:00 PM, always in the gray suit, always with no memory of previous
Tuesdays. He existed for exactly forty-seven minutes. He was warm and
solid and cast shadows and could drink tea and sit in chairs and hold
her hand, and at 3:47 he was gone, as completely and irrevocably as
though he had never been, except for the warmth in the teacup and the
shape in the cushion and the ache in Yuki's chest that was both grief
and gratitude and something else she did not have a name for.

She told him, every week. She had to — he did not remember, and she
would not deceive him. The conversation became a kind of choreography:
his arrival, his surprise, her explanation, his shock, his processing,
his acceptance. Each time, the acceptance came a little faster, not
because he remembered but because the explanation, in its mad
precision, appealed to the accountant in him. The numbers added up, even
if they added up to something impossible.

"I want to understand the mechanism," he said, on the fourth Tuesday.
"What causes the loop?"

"I don't know."

"Is it the house? If I left the house — "

"I don't know. We only have forty-seven minutes. I don't want to spend
them testing hypotheses."

"You're a mathematics teacher, Yuki. You love testing hypotheses."

"I love you more."

He smiled. It was the smile she would have sold the house for, the
smile she would have traded every law of physics to preserve. "That's
the nicest thing you've ever said to me."

"I've said nicer things."

"Not that I remember."

"You don't remember anything, Kenji. That's the whole problem."

He laughed. She laughed. They laughed together in the kitchen on a
Tuesday afternoon, and outside the window the neighborhood went about
its business — the mail carrier, the woman walking her dog, the
children coming home from school — all of them unaware that in the
Nakamura house, the laws of the universe had developed a crack, and
through the crack, love was leaking in.

                               * * *

On the seventh Tuesday, Yuki realized she had stopped grieving.

This was not the same as being happy. It was more complicated than that.
She was a woman who had lost her husband and who saw him for forty-seven
minutes every week, and the emotional topology of this situation was
not one that any grief counselor or self-help book had anticipated. She
was simultaneously bereaved and companioned, mourning and beloved, alone
and not alone. She lived in a state of perpetual Tuesday, organizing her
entire week around those forty-seven minutes, and she was aware that
this was not healthy and did not care.

"You're living for Tuesdays," said her daughter Emiko, who called every
Sunday from Osaka and who had begun to notice that her mother sounded
different.

"I'm living," Yuki said. "That's an improvement."

"Mom, are you sure you're okay? You sound — I don't know. You sound
like you have a secret."

"Everyone has secrets, Emiko."

"You don't. You're the most transparent person I've ever met. Dad
always said — " She caught herself, the way she always did when she
mentioned Kenji, as though the name were a sharp edge she kept
accidentally touching.

"Dad always said I was a terrible liar," Yuki finished. "He was right.
But some truths are harder to explain than lies."

                               IV.

On the twelfth Tuesday, something changed.

Kenji appeared at 3:00 PM, as always. Gray suit, refrigerator, mild
surprise. Yuki poured the tea, began the explanation. But this time,
halfway through — at the point where she described the aneurysm, the
hospital, the identification of the body — he raised his hand.

"Wait," he said. "Wait. I — " He pressed his fingertips to his temples.
"I know this. I don't remember it, but I know it. Like a word on the
tip of my tongue. You've told me this before."

Yuki's heart accelerated. "You remember?"

"Not remember. Know. There's a difference. The information isn't stored
in my memory. It's stored somewhere else. In the — " He gestured
vaguely at his body, at the air, at the kitchen. "In the pattern. In
the shape of the thing that brings me here. Yuki, something is
changing."

She set down her tea. Her hands were trembling. "What's changing?"

"I don't know. But I can feel it. The loop — it's not as tight as it
was. There's give in it. Elasticity. As though something is applying
pressure from outside."

"Something like what?"

He looked at her. "Something like you."

She stared at him. He stared back. And in the space between them, in
the kitchen that smelled of hojicha and chrysanthemums, something
shifted — not in the room, not in the air, but in the structure of the
impossibility itself, as though the crack in the universe had widened
just enough to let a different kind of light through.

"Kenji," she said. "If the loop is loosening — if there's give in it —
then maybe — "

"Maybe I could stay."

"Maybe you could stay."

"Past 3:47."

"Past 3:47."

They looked at each other. Hope is a dangerous thing — Yuki knew this,
had learned it the hard way, had spent seven months learning that hope
deferred makes the heart sick — but she could not stop it. It rose in
her like water in a vessel, filling spaces she had not known were empty.

"How?" Kenji asked. "How do we do it?"

"I don't know. But I think — " She paused, feeling for the shape of
the idea. "I think the loop is anchored to the original timeline. Your
timeline, September sixth. Every Tuesday, it replays the last six hours
of that day. If we could disrupt the anchor — change something,
introduce a variable that the original timeline didn't contain — "

"Then the loop couldn't complete. It would have to resolve differently."

"Yes."

"And the resolution might be — "

"You staying. Permanently. A new timeline branching off from the loop."

Kenji was quiet. She could see him working it through — the accountant's
mind, precise and methodical, turning the impossible into columns and
rows. "But if a new timeline branches," he said, "then the old timeline
— the one where I died — "

"Would still exist. Somewhere. In some version of the math, September
sixth still happens. The aneurysm still happens."

"But not here. Not in this branch."

"Not in this branch."

"And the version of you in this branch — the Yuki who spent seven
months alone, who learned to live without me, who built a new life in
the shape of grief — "

"Would never have existed. If the branch point is before your death,
then that Yuki — this Yuki — was never necessary. The seven months
collapse. The grief collapses. Everything I learned, everything I
became — "

She stopped. The realization landed like a dropped cup: sharp, definitive,
impossible to put back together.

If she saved him, she lost herself.

Not the physical self — her body would persist, her memories would
persist, the world would go on. But the self that had been forged in
the seven months since his death — the self that had learned to sleep
alone, to eat alone, to carry the weight of an empty house, to find
meaning in the absence of the person who had given meaning to
everything — that self would never have existed. The timeline that
produced her would be erased. She would be replaced by a different Yuki,
a Yuki who had never grieved, who had never learned what grief could
teach, who had never discovered that she was capable of surviving the
unsurvivable.

"Yuki," Kenji said quietly. "You can't."

"I can. The math works. I'm almost sure the math works."

"I don't mean you can't do the math. I mean you shouldn't. What you've
become — what these seven months have made you — "

"What these seven months have made me is a woman who talks to a teacup
and counts the hours until Tuesday. That is not a life, Kenji."

"It is a life. It's your life. And it's — " He reached across the table
and took her hand. His grip was strong and warm and real. "Yuki, listen
to me. I'm an echo. A repetition. A forty-seven-minute ghost. You are
a whole person. A person who survived losing me. Do you understand how
remarkable that is? Do you understand what it means that you are sitting
here, alive, functioning, capable of having this conversation? You did
the hardest thing a person can do. You kept living."

"I kept living for Tuesdays."

"You kept living. The reason doesn't matter. The living matters."

The clock showed 3:38. Nine minutes.

"I could have you back," she whispered. "Every day. Not forty-seven
minutes — every day. Mornings. Evenings. The stupid budget meetings
and the jokes in the elevator and the stiff shoulder from the softball
game. I could have all of it back."

"At the cost of everything you've learned. At the cost of the person
you've become. Yuki — " His eyes were bright with something she had
never seen in twenty-three years of marriage: the absolute, focused
clarity of a man who knows he is about to die and who is choosing, with
his last minutes, to give a gift. "I am so proud of you. I am so proud
of the woman you became without me. Don't erase her. She's magnificent."

Yuki was crying. The tears fell on their joined hands, on the table, on
the kitchen floor that still bore the faint marks of the Meissen cup she
had dropped twenty-three Tuesdays ago. She was crying, and Kenji was
holding her hand, and the clock was moving, and the forty-seven minutes
were almost gone.

"Will you come back?" she asked. "Next Tuesday?"

"I don't know. If the loop is loosening — if something is changing — I
don't know."

"Then this might be the last time."

"It might."

She looked at him. He looked at her. The clock showed 3:44. Three
minutes.

"Kenji."

"Yes."

"I love you. Across every timeline. In every branch. Whatever version
of me exists, in whatever version of the universe — she loves you. That
is the one thing the math cannot change."

He smiled. The smile she would have sold the house for. "I know," he
said. "I've always known."

3:45. Two minutes.

"Tell me something," she said. "Something I don't know. Something to
keep."

He thought for a moment. "The day we met — at the faculty party, the
one Suzuki organized — I was going to leave early. I had a headache.
I was putting on my coat. And then I heard you laughing, across the
room, and I thought: that is the most beautiful sound I have ever heard.
And I took my coat off and stayed. I never told you that."

"Why not?"

"Because some things are better saved. For the right moment."

3:46. One minute.

She held his hand. He held hers. The kitchen was quiet. The
chrysanthemums stood in their vase, yellow and white. The tea was
growing cold. Outside, the neighborhood carried on. Inside, the clock
moved.

3:47.

He was gone. The chair was empty. The tea was still warm.

Yuki sat in the kitchen for a long time. She did not cry. She did not
move. She held the space where his hand had been, feeling the residual
warmth fade from her fingers, and she thought about laughter at a
faculty party, and a coat being taken off, and all the ordinary
miracles that lead to love, and all the extraordinary cruelties that
take it away, and all the impossible Tuesdays in between.

Then she washed both cups. She put the chrysanthemums in fresh water.
She went to the living room and sat at her desk and opened a notebook.

She began to write. Not the math — she would not do the math, would not
calculate the branch point, would not solve the equation that could give
her back what she had lost at the cost of what she had become. She wrote
something else: a letter, addressed to no one and everyone, about a man
in a gray suit who appeared in a kitchen every Tuesday, and a woman who
chose, in the end, not to save him.

Because saving him would have meant erasing the person who loved him
most. And that, Yuki decided — setting down her pen, looking out the
window at the ordinary, irreversible Tuesday evening — was a paradox
even love could not resolve.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                     LETTER FROM A DISTANT STAR

                        by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The letter arrived on a Monday in October, when the light in Stockholm
was the color of old paper and the birch trees along Strandvagen had
turned the particular shade of gold that meant winter was thinking about
coming but had not yet made up its mind. Maren Solberg found it in her
mailbox between a gas bill and a notice from the municipal library about
an overdue book, and she carried it upstairs to her apartment without
looking at it, because she was carrying groceries in her other hand and
because mail, in her experience, was never important enough to warrant
dropping a bag of potatoes.

She set the groceries on the kitchen counter. She put the potatoes in
the cupboard. She filled the kettle and set it on the stove. And then,
with the unhurried precision of a woman who lived alone and saw no
reason to rush, she sat down at the kitchen table and opened the letter.

The envelope was unusual. It was not paper but a thin, stiff material
that felt like a cross between cardboard and metal — a composite,
smooth and cool under her fingers, with a faintly iridescent surface
that caught the afternoon light. There was no postage stamp. In the
upper left corner, where a return address would be, there was a small
printed insignia — a circle containing a stylized star — and beneath it,
in small, precise type: SWEDISH SPACE AUTHORITY — INTERSTELLAR RELAY
DIVISION.

Maren looked at this for a moment. Then she turned the envelope over.
On the back, a second line of type: CONTENTS TRANSMITTED FROM COLONY
VESSEL AURORA. SIGNAL RECEIVED: 14 MARCH 2019. ORIGINAL TRANSMISSION
DATE: 9 JUNE 1987. TRANSIT TIME: 32 YEARS, 9 MONTHS, 5 DAYS.

She set the envelope down. The kettle was beginning to make the small,
preliminary sounds that meant it was thinking about boiling. She let it
think. She picked the envelope up again and withdrew a single sheet of
the same composite material, folded once. She unfolded it.

The handwriting was neat and small, with the careful precision of someone
writing by hand because the act of writing mattered, because the
physical formation of each letter was part of the message. It was
written in Swedish.

     Dear Maren,

     You do not know me. My name is Erik Lindgren. I am writing
     to you from the colony vessel Aurora, which departed Earth
     orbit on 15 September 1969, bound for the Tau Ceti system.
     As I write this, we are approximately 4.2 light-years from
     Earth. I am fifty-three years old. By the time you read this
     — if you read this — I will be dead. The transit time for
     this transmission is estimated at thirty to thirty-five
     years, and I do not expect to live another thirty-five years.

     I am writing because I saw your photograph.

Maren stopped reading. She put the letter down on the table, stood up,
turned off the kettle, poured the water into a cup, added a tea bag,
and sat down again. The ritual of tea was necessary. It was a bridge
between one state of mind and another, a familiar action that allowed
the unfamiliar to settle without overwhelming.

She picked up the letter and continued.

     I am writing because I saw your photograph. The Aurora
     maintains a database of potential colonists — citizens of the
     participating nations who have registered interest in colonial
     settlement, along with biographical information and, in some
     cases, photographs. The database is updated by periodic
     transmissions from Earth, though the most recent update we
     received was compiled in 1982 and the information in it is
     now five years old at minimum.

     Your entry was filed in 1978. You were twenty-three years
     old. You had recently completed a degree in library science
     at Uppsala University. Your biographical sketch described you
     as "a reader, a walker, a person who values silence." Your
     interests were listed as literature, natural history, and
     Nordic folk music. Your photograph showed a woman with light
     brown hair and serious eyes, standing in front of a building
     I recognized as the Carolina Rediviva library.

     I have looked at your photograph many times. I do not say
     this to alarm you. I say it because honesty, at the distances
     involved, seems more important than propriety.

     I looked at your photograph and I thought: here is a person
     I could talk to. Not because of the photograph itself, though
     it is a fine photograph. But because of the biographical
     sketch. A reader, a walker, a person who values silence. I
     am also these things. Or I was, before I boarded this ship
     and exchanged the silence of the Swedish countryside for the
     silence of interstellar space, which is a different kind of
     silence entirely — not an absence of sound but an absence of
     everything, a silence so vast that it has texture, depth, and
     weight.

Maren set down her tea. Her hands were not trembling — she was not a
woman whose hands trembled — but there was a stillness in her that was
the opposite of calm. A stillness of attention, of every faculty
focused on the page before her, on the neat, small handwriting, on
the voice of a man who had written these words thirty-two years ago
from a ship that was now — she did the calculation automatically, the
librarian's habit of placing things in context — approximately 7.8
light-years from Earth, assuming constant velocity, which meant that
the Aurora was now past the halfway point of its journey to Tau Ceti.

She continued.

     I should tell you about myself. I was born in Kiruna, in
     the far north, in 1934. My father was an iron miner. My
     mother was a schoolteacher. I grew up in darkness and snow
     and the kind of cold that teaches you to value warmth not as
     a comfort but as a decision — a thing you choose, a thing
     you maintain, a thing you build against the dark.

     I studied engineering at the Royal Institute of Technology
     in Stockholm and worked for Saab in Trollhattan for twelve
     years before I applied for the Aurora program. I was
     thirty-five. I was unmarried. I had no children. I had
     friends, a career, a small house near the Gota alv that I
     liked very much. I gave all of it up because I believed —
     and still believe — that a human life should be spent
     reaching for something beyond its grasp. Tau Ceti was
     beyond my grasp. I reached anyway.

     That was eighteen years ago. I have spent eighteen years on
     this ship. I have maintained its propulsion systems. I have
     repaired its hull after micrometeorite impacts. I have
     celebrated births and mourned deaths — twenty-three colonists
     have died since departure, of illness, of accident, of the
     particular slow erosion that long confinement exerts on the
     human spirit. I have watched the sun diminish in the rear
     observation port until it became a star among stars, no
     brighter than any other, and I have felt the vertigo of
     understanding that the place I came from is now just another
     point of light.

     And I have been lonely. Not always — the Aurora carries three
     hundred and twelve colonists, and there is community here,
     and friendship, and the daily work that gives structure to
     a life. But there is a loneliness that community cannot
     touch — the loneliness of a person who has not found the
     particular other person who makes solitude into something
     chosen rather than something endured. I have not found that
     person. I looked for her on the ship, among my fellow
     colonists, in the daily interactions of a small community
     in a metal shell hurtling through the void. She was not
     there.

     And then, one evening in the archive room — I spend my
     evenings in the archive room, reading, because books are
     the only thing on this ship that is larger than the ship
     itself — I found the colonist database, and I found your
     entry, and I found your photograph, and I thought: there
     she is.

     I know this is absurd. I know that a photograph and a
     biographical sketch are not a person. I know that the woman
     in the photograph is nine years younger than I am and thirty-
     two light-years away and may, by the time this letter
     arrives, have married, had children, grown old, forgotten
     that she ever registered in a colonist database. I know all
     of this.

     But I also know what I felt when I looked at your photograph,
     and what I feel when I think about the words "a person who
     values silence," and what I imagine when I picture you
     standing in front of the Carolina Rediviva with your serious
     eyes and your light brown hair, and it is this:

     I imagine sitting with you. Not talking. Not doing anything
     in particular. Just sitting, in a room with books, in the
     kind of silence that two people can share when they do not
     need to fill it. I imagine this, and the imagining is the
     warmest thing on this ship, warmer than the fusion reactor,
     warmer than the recycled air, warmer than anything the
     engineers have built.

     I am writing this letter because I wanted you to know that
     you exist, in this form, in my imagination. I wanted you to
     know that thirty-two light-years from Earth, a man who grew
     up in the dark and the cold thinks of you when he thinks of
     warmth. I wanted you to know that you are, for me, what the
     word "home" means — not a place, but a quality of attention,
     a way of being present in silence, a photograph and six words
     that somehow, across all the distance the universe can
     manufacture, said: here is someone you could love.

     I do not expect a reply. The transit time makes conversation
     impossible — by the time your response reached us, I would
     be dead or very old, and the Aurora would be deep in the Tau
     Ceti system, beyond all practical communication. This letter
     is not the beginning of a correspondence. It is a single
     transmission, sent into the dark, carrying the only cargo
     that justifies the journey: the truth that one human being
     thought of another across an impossible distance, and that
     the thinking was the most important thing he ever did.

     Be well, Maren. Walk. Read. Value the silence. And know that
     someone, once, from very far away, loved you.

                                   Erik Lindgren
                                   Colony Vessel Aurora
                                   9 June 1987

                               II.

Maren read the letter three times. She read it the first time quickly,
her eyes moving faster than her comprehension, absorbing the shape of
it before the substance. She read it the second time slowly, word by
word, letting each sentence settle before moving to the next. She read
it the third time aloud, in a quiet voice, to the empty apartment, and
the sound of the words in her own mouth made them more real than the
page had.

Then she set the letter on the table and sat with it.

The tea had gone cold. The light through the kitchen window had shifted
from the gold of late afternoon to the gray-blue of approaching
evening. In the apartment below, she could hear Mrs. Johannsen's
television — a faint, rhythmic murmur that had been the background
sound of Maren's evenings for fifteen years.

She was fifty-four years old. She had light brown hair that was now
mostly gray, and serious eyes that were now lined at the corners with
the particular fine wrinkles that come from a life spent reading in
imperfect light. She was a librarian at the Stadsbiblioteket — the
Stockholm Public Library — where she had worked for twenty-six years.
She had never married. She had a cat named Strindberg, a small circle
of friends, a life of books and walks and the kind of solitude that she
had always valued and that she had always, in some small, unexamined
part of herself, hoped was a prelude rather than a conclusion.

She had registered in the colonist database in 1978. She remembered
this. She had been twenty-three, recently graduated, filled with the
particular restlessness of a person who loved the world but wanted to
see a different one. She had filled out the form on a whim, at a
recruitment event at the university, and had thought nothing more of
it. She had never been contacted. She had, until this moment, forgotten
that the form existed.

And now a man who had seen that form — who had seen her photograph and
read her six-word description and felt, across thirty-two light-years,
something that he called love — was dead. Had been dead for twenty
years, if the letter's arithmetic was correct. He had died on the
Aurora, or he had arrived at Tau Ceti and died there, and in either
case, the distance between them was now absolute — not merely
interstellar but existential, the unbridgeable gap between the living
and the dead.

She picked up the letter again. The handwriting was beautiful. She had
not noticed this on the first reading, but now she saw it: the care
with which each letter was formed, the consistency of the spacing, the
slight rightward lean that suggested a left-handed writer compensating.
He had taken time with this. He had made each word a physical act, a
mark on a page, and the marks had traveled thirty-two years and
thirty-two light-years to reach her kitchen table on a Monday in
October.

     I do not expect a reply.

But she wanted to reply. The wanting was sudden, fierce, and wholly
irrational. She wanted to write back to a man who was dead, on a ship
that had passed beyond all practical communication, to say — what?
That she had received his letter. That she had read it three times.
That the description of sitting in silence with books had made her
cry, not because it was sad but because it was the most precise
description of her own deepest wish that she had ever encountered, and
it had come from a stranger, from the void, from a distance that
should have made precision impossible.

She wanted to say: I would have sat with you.

                               III.

She learned everything she could.

The Stockholm Public Library was not, strictly speaking, the ideal
resource for researching interstellar colony missions, but Maren was
a librarian, and a librarian with a research question is a force that
bureaucratic obstacles cannot long withstand. Within a week, she had
obtained, through interlibrary loan and the judicious use of her
professional network, a comprehensive file on the colony vessel Aurora.

The Aurora had departed Earth orbit on September 15, 1969, carrying
312 colonists from Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland — a joint
Scandinavian colonial venture, funded by the four governments and
administered by the newly formed Swedish Space Authority. The ship was
a generation vessel, designed for a transit time of approximately
ninety years. The colonists who boarded in 1969 would not reach Tau
Ceti. Their grandchildren would.

Erik Lindgren was listed in the crew manifest: Engineer, Second Class.
Born Kiruna, 1934. Education: Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm,
1958. Previous employment: Saab-Scania, Trollhattan, 1958-1969.
Marital status at departure: Single. Next of kin: Sven Lindgren
(father, deceased 1971), Margareta Lindgren (mother, deceased 1975).

There was a photograph. Maren studied it with an attention she normally
reserved for first editions. He was thin-faced, fair-haired, with the
sharp cheekbones and pale eyes of the far north. He was not handsome
in any conventional sense — his features were too angular, his
expression too serious — but there was something in the photograph
that she recognized, the way you recognize a word in a foreign language
that sounds like a word in your own. A quality of attention. A
steadiness. The look of a person who saw clearly and did not flinch
from what he saw.

The mission reports told the rest. The Aurora had maintained contact
with Earth through periodic radio transmissions, the frequency
decreasing as the distance increased and the signal weakened. The last
confirmed transmission from the ship had been received in 2003 — a
routine status report indicating that the vessel was functioning within
normal parameters, the population had grown to 487, and the ship was
approximately 8.1 light-years from Earth. After 2003, silence. Not
necessarily alarming — the signal attenuation at that distance made
communication increasingly difficult, and the Aurora's transmitter
had been designed for a fifty-year operational life — but silence
nonetheless.

Erik Lindgren's name appeared in the crew records for the last time in
a medical report dated March 1998, which noted that he had been
diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia and placed on a treatment protocol.
He would have been sixty-four. There were no subsequent records. The
Space Authority's database listed him as "status unknown — presumed
deceased."

Maren closed the file. She sat at her desk in the library's reference
section, surrounded by books and the quiet, purposeful sounds of a
library at work — the whisper of pages, the soft click of keyboards,
the occasional murmured conversation — and she thought about a man
sixty-four years old with a bad heart and careful handwriting, alone
on a ship between the stars, writing a love letter to a photograph.

And she thought: I need to write back.

                               IV.

The response, when she composed it, took eleven days.

Not because the words were difficult to find — she knew what she wanted
to say, had known since the first reading — but because the words had
to be right. They had to carry the weight of what she felt across a
distance that made weight meaningless. They had to reach a ship that
might no longer be listening, a man who was certainly no longer alive,
and they had to matter anyway. The mattering was the point. Not the
receiving — the sending.

She wrote by hand. This felt important. He had written by hand, and
she would answer in kind, letter for letter, the physical act of
writing a bridge across the void, a cable of ink and intention strung
between two points that could not be connected by any other means.

She wrote in Swedish, as he had. She used her best stationery — heavy
cream-colored paper from a shop on Vasterlånggatan that she visited
once a year for exactly this purpose, though she had never before had
a purpose that justified it.

     Dear Erik,

     I received your letter on a Monday in October. You have been
     dead for twenty years. I am writing to you anyway, because
     the alternative — silence — seems like a betrayal of
     something I do not fully understand but feel obligated to
     honor.

     I am fifty-four years old. I am a librarian. I have a cat
     named Strindberg who is judgmental and affectionate in
     roughly equal measure. I have spent my life in the silence
     you described — the chosen silence of a person who finds in
     books and walks and solitude a richness that conversation
     cannot always provide. I have been happy. I want you to
     know that. Whatever you imagined for me, from your archive
     room among the stars — I have been happy.

     But I have also been waiting. I did not know this until I
     read your letter. I thought my solitude was complete — a
     finished thing, a life that lacked nothing essential. Your
     letter showed me the space in it. Not a hole, not a deficit,
     but a space — the particular space that is left when a person
     you have not yet met is already, somehow, missing.

     You are the person I have not yet met. You are the person
     who was always missing. I know this with a certainty that
     frightens me, because certainty at this distance is
     irrational, and I am a librarian, and librarians are not
     supposed to be irrational about anything except overdue
     books.

     But here it is, the irrational truth: I read your letter,
     and I knew you. Not the facts of you — the facts are in the
     crew manifest, and they tell me nothing except that you were
     born in Kiruna and studied engineering and had a bad heart.
     I knew the shape of you. The quality of your attention. The
     way you see the world — carefully, precisely, with the
     patience of someone who understands that the most important
     things reveal themselves slowly, in silence, in the spaces
     between words.

     You wrote that you imagined sitting with me in silence. I
     want you to know that I am sitting with you now. In this
     kitchen, with this letter, in this silence. The tea has gone
     cold. The cat is asleep on the radiator. The light through
     the window is the gray-blue of a Stockholm evening, the
     light you would recognize, the light of home. And I am
     sitting with you, Erik. Across every distance. In the only
     way we can.

     You wrote that this letter is not the beginning of a
     correspondence. You are wrong. It is the beginning of
     something, even if the something has no name and no
     possibility of continuation. It is the beginning of my
     knowing that you existed, that you thought of me, that you
     loved me from a distance that should have made love
     impossible and did not. That beginning does not require a
     response. It does not require continuation. It requires only
     that I acknowledge it, which I am doing now, with this
     letter, in this silence, in this kitchen, in this city that
     you left fifty years ago to reach for something beyond
     your grasp.

     I hope you reached it. I hope Tau Ceti is everything you
     imagined. I hope the silence there is the kind you can
     share.

     And I hope — this is the part that is hardest to write,
     the part that makes no sense, the part that the librarian
     in me wants to cross out and the rest of me will not allow
     — I hope that somewhere, in whatever comes after, there is
     a room with books, and two chairs, and the kind of silence
     that two people make when they are together and do not need
     to speak. And I hope you are there. And I hope there is a
     place for me.

     Be well, Erik. Wherever you are. Whatever you have become.
     Know that someone, here, from very far away, loves you back.

                                   Maren Solberg
                                   Stockholm
                                   October 2019

                               V.

She took the letter to the Space Authority office in Solna on a
Wednesday morning. The office was a modest building in an industrial
park — not the gleaming spaceport of science fiction, but a collection
of gray offices staffed by civil servants who processed paperwork
related to Sweden's contributions to the interstellar program.

The woman at the reception desk — young, efficient, wearing the
particular expression of someone who dealt with the public and wished
she didn't — looked at the letter with mild confusion.

"You want to send a letter. To the Aurora."

"Yes."

"The colony vessel Aurora. The one that departed in 1969."

"Yes."

"Ma'am, the Aurora's last confirmed communication was in 2003. We have
no current contact with the vessel. The transmission relay at Esrange
is technically still operational, but the probability of the signal
reaching the ship at its current estimated distance is — " She
consulted her screen. "Approximately four percent. And even if it
reaches the ship, we have no confirmation that the ship's receiver is
still functional."

"I understand."

"And even if the receiver is functional, the transit time for a signal
at this distance would be approximately — " More screen consultation.
"Forty-one years."

"I understand."

The woman looked at Maren. Maren looked back. There was a moment of
the kind that occurs when a bureaucrat encounters a citizen whose
request is technically within the scope of services offered but whose
motivations are clearly outside the scope of anything the bureaucrat
has been trained to handle.

"You understand that the recipient is almost certainly — "

"Dead. Yes. I understand."

Another pause. The woman's expression shifted — a small, almost
imperceptible softening, as though something in Maren's face had
communicated something that words had not.

"I'll process the transmission request," she said. "There's a form."

"Of course there is."

Maren filled out the form. She provided the letter. She paid the
transmission fee — a nominal amount, subsidized by the government,
because the interstellar communication program had been established
in the 1970s with the understanding that maintaining connection with
the colony ships was a public good, even when the connection was
tenuous, even when the recipients were dead, even when the only cargo
the signal carried was words.

She walked home. The October light was thin and clear, the kind of
light that makes everything look precise — the edges of buildings, the
veins in the last leaves on the birch trees, the surface of the water
in Nybroviken, where a pair of swans moved in slow, symmetrical arcs.
She walked slowly, because she was a walker, because walking was how
she thought, and because she wanted to feel the city around her — the
city Erik had left, the city she had stayed in, the city that existed
at one end of a signal that would travel for forty-one years through
the dark to reach a ship that might not be there.

It didn't matter. The signal would travel anyway. The words would
cross the void, carried by electromagnetic radiation at the speed of
light, indifferent to whether anyone was listening, indifferent to
whether the ship was intact or the receiver functional or the
recipient alive. The words would travel because they had been sent,
and the sending was the point, and the point was love, and love, Maren
understood now, was the only signal that justified the infrastructure.

She reached her apartment. She climbed the stairs. She unlocked the
door. Strindberg was on the radiator, as always, his eyes half-closed,
his expression conveying the particular blend of disdain and affection
that was his trademark.

"I sent a letter," she told him.

Strindberg opened one eye, assessed the information, and closed it
again.

Maren made tea. She sat at the kitchen table, in the chair she always
sat in, and she looked at the empty chair across from her, and she
thought about a man in the archive room of a ship between the stars,
looking at her photograph, and she thought about the distance between
them — not the light-years, not the decades, but the other distance,
the one that mattered, the distance between two people who could have
loved each other and never got the chance.

That distance, she decided, was the smallest distance in the universe.
Smaller than an atom. Smaller than a photon. Smaller than the space
between one word and the next on a page of careful handwriting. Because
the distance was not spatial and not temporal. It was the distance
between wanting and having, between imagining and knowing, between a
letter sent and a letter received, and that distance — the distance of
longing — was the one dimension that contracted when you paid attention
to it, that shrank when you acknowledged it, that collapsed to nothing
when you said, simply, honestly, across all the light-years and all the
years: I love you back.

She sat in the silence. It was a good silence. Not empty. Full of
something she could not name but did not need to, because naming was
not the point. The point was the silence itself, shared now, across
every distance, with a man who had valued it as she did, who had
written to her from the void because he recognized in her photograph
and her six words a quality of attention that matched his own.

Outside, the Stockholm evening settled over the city — the early dark
of October, the lights coming on in windows, the sound of the city
quieting, the particular Scandinavian twilight that is not quite dark
and not quite light but something in between, a threshold, a space
where the day has ended and the night has not begun and everything is
suspended in a stillness that feels, for a moment, like it could
last forever.

Maren sat in the stillness. She drank her tea. She did not turn on the
light.

She did not need to. She was not in the dark.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                          DUELING HEARTS

                         by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

The challenge came on a Thursday, which was just like Zara Chen's luck
— Thursdays on Caterina Colony were mandatory maintenance days, and she
had a thruster coupling to rebuild on the _Red Talon_ before nightfall.
She was elbow-deep in a plasma manifold, cursing in three languages,
when the formal notice hit her comm unit with the particular chime that
meant Official Colony Business, Do Not Ignore.

She pulled her arm out of the coupling, wiped the coolant gel on her
flight suit, and read the notice.

    TO: Pilot First Class Zara Chen
    FROM: The Office of the Arbiter of Honor
    RE: Formal Challenge — Courtship Dispute — Class Two

    You are hereby notified that Pilot Second Class Daria Venkov
    has filed a Formal Challenge of Courtship under Article 17
    of the Colonial Charter, claiming prior right of affection
    toward Chief Engineer Tomás Reyes. As the challenged party,
    you have seventy-two hours to accept, decline, or negotiate
    terms. Refusal to respond will be recorded as forfeiture.

    Arbiter Kojo Mensah presiding.
    The Ancestors witness. The Colony endures.

Zara read it twice. Then she threw her wrench across the hangar bay,
where it bounced off the hull of a parked cargo shuttle and scared the
living daylights out of a maintenance drone.

"That absolute — " She caught herself. The maintenance bay had ears,
and the colony gossip network moved faster than a signal laser. She
retrieved her wrench, took three deep breaths in the way her mother had
taught her, and composed a reply.

    TO: The Office of the Arbiter of Honor
    FROM: Pilot First Class Zara Chen
    RE: Challenge Acceptance

    Accepted. Name the ground.

The reply came in four minutes.

    Ground: Hull of the Colony Ship Esperanza, in standard
    orbit. Zero-gravity combat rules apply per Section 17.4.
    Weapons: ceremonial blades, Arbiter's selection. Time: 1400
    hours, Sunday. Public broadcast confirmed. Estimated
    viewership: 4,200.

    The Ancestors witness. The Colony endures.

Four thousand two hundred people. That was nearly the entire colony
population. Zara closed her eyes. She had been on Caterina for three
years, had run supply routes between the surface settlements and the
orbital platform, had earned a reputation as the best pilot in the
colony's modest fleet, and had somehow managed to do all of this without
becoming a public spectacle.

That streak, evidently, was over.

                               * * *

The thing about Caterina Colony was the dueling.

Every colony world developed its own traditions — that was the nature of
planting human beings on alien soil and letting them grow. On Meridian,
they settled disputes through competitive poetry. On Vasquez Station,
they used a complicated system of debt tokens that nobody from off-world
had ever fully understood. On the water world of Pelion, they raced
sailboats.

On Caterina, they fought.

The tradition dated back to the colony's founding generation — a mix of
Brazilian, West African, and Southeast Asian settlers who had brought
with them a shared appreciation for martial culture and a practical
understanding that small communities needed formal mechanisms for
resolving conflict before it turned lethal. The Colonial Charter,
drafted during the thirty-year transit, included Article 17: the Right
of Challenge, a legal framework that allowed colonists to settle disputes
through ceremonial single combat under the supervision of an Arbiter of
Honor.

The duels were not to the death — the Charter was very clear on this
point. They were fought to "first yield or first blood, whichever comes
first," with ceremonial blades that were sharp enough to cut but
designed to minimize lethality. The Arbiter enforced the rules, the
colony watched, and the outcome was legally binding. It was, in
practice, a formalized bar fight with better choreography and
significantly higher stakes.

Courtship disputes were the most common type. In a colony of four
thousand people, romantic entanglements were inevitable, and the
Charter's framers had wisely decided that a structured, public, and
legally final mechanism for resolving them was preferable to the
alternative, which was festering resentment and the occasional airlock
"accident." Article 17.3 allowed any colonist to challenge a rival for
the affections of a third party, provided that the third party had not
already declared a formal partnership.

Tomás Reyes had not declared a formal partnership with anyone. This was,
Zara reflected, both the source of the problem and the reason for her
current predicament.

                               * * *

She found Tomás in the engineering bay of the colony's geothermal plant,
which was where she usually found him — hunched over a schematic, his
dark hair falling in his eyes, his hands moving with the unconscious
grace of a man who thought in three dimensions. He was, in Zara's
professionally unbiased opinion, the most beautiful man on Caterina,
and also the most oblivious, which was a combination that she found
simultaneously infuriating and irresistible.

"Tomás."

He looked up. His face did the thing it always did when he saw her —
the slight brightening, the half-smile, the quick, unconscious
straightening of posture that he probably didn't know he did and that
made Zara's heart turn over in her chest like a poorly balanced
gyroscope.

"Zara! Good, I wanted to talk to you about the thruster coupling on
the _Talon_. I think the plasma flow is—"

"Daria Venkov challenged me to a duel for your affections."

Tomás blinked. "She what?"

"Filed a formal challenge. Article 17. Courtship dispute. I accepted.
We fight Sunday on the hull of the Esperanza. The whole colony is going
to watch."

He stared at her. His mouth opened. It closed. It opened again. "You're
joking."

"I am not joking. Do I look like I'm joking?"

He studied her face. "You look like you want to hit something."

"I do want to hit something. Fortunately, on Sunday, I'll have the
opportunity."

"Zara, this is — " He ran his hand through his hair, which was what he
did when he was processing information that didn't fit any schematic he
knew. "This is insane. I'm not a — I'm an engineer. I fix things.
People don't fight duels over engineers."

"Apparently they do."

"I haven't even — I mean, Daria and I — we had dinner twice! That's
all! We talked about the water reclamation system! That's not — that
doesn't constitute a courtship claim!"

"Under Article 17, any pattern of social interaction that a reasonable
party could interpret as courtship behavior constitutes grounds for a
claim. Dinner twice counts."

"We talked about water reclamation!"

"Romantic dinner conversation is not a prerequisite."

Tomás sank into his chair. He looked at Zara. She looked at him. There
was a moment — the kind of moment that happens between two people who
have been circling each other for months, each waiting for the other to
make a move, each too stubborn or too afraid to be the first — when the
pretense became visibly thin.

"Zara," he said. "Why did you accept?"

She crossed her arms. "Because Daria Venkov does not get to claim you
by default. Because I have spent three years flying supplies to this
colony and rebuilding thruster couplings and eating terrible reconstituted
food and watching you hunch over schematics with your hair in your eyes,
and I'll be damned if I let someone else walk off with you because I
was too proud to fight for what I want."

The engineering bay was quiet. The geothermal plant hummed beneath them
— the deep, steady thrum of the planet's core being converted into
power. Tomás looked at her with an expression she had not seen before:
not the half-smile, not the brightening, but something deeper and
more serious, something that looked very much like a man realizing that
the schematic he'd been studying had been upside down the whole time.

"You want me," he said, as though testing the words.

"I want you. Is that a problem?"

"No," he said. "It is emphatically not a problem."

She allowed herself, for one second, to smile. Then she uncrossed her
arms. "Good. Now — I need a training partner. I have three days to
prepare for a zero-g blade fight on the hull of a moving ship in front
of four thousand people. Are you going to sit there looking stunned, or
are you going to help me?"

He stood up. "I'm going to help you."

"Good. Bring your welding gloves. We're going to need the practice mats."

                               * * *

The thing about fighting in zero gravity was that it changed everything.

On a planet surface, combat was a negotiation with gravity — every move
was a trade-off between force and balance, between striking power and
the need to keep your feet under you. In zero-g, there was no balance.
There were no feet under you. There was only mass, momentum, and the
ruthless geometry of angular velocity.

Zara had trained in zero-g combat as part of her pilot certification —
all colony pilots did, a relic of an era when piracy in the outer
systems was a genuine concern — but she had not practiced in two years,
and Daria Venkov, she knew, trained three times a week.

Daria was a pilot too — younger than Zara by six years, taller by ten
centimeters, and possessed of a long reach and a competitive fire that
Zara respected in the way that you respect a forest fire bearing down
on your house. They had flown together on supply runs, shared meals in
the common hall, played cards on off-rotation nights. They were not
enemies. They were rivals, which was more complicated and more
interesting.

For three days, Zara trained. She trained in the cargo bay of the
_Red Talon_, where Tomás had rigged a makeshift zero-g arena by
deactivating the artificial gravity in a ten-meter cube and padding the
walls. She relearned the fundamentals: how to use a blade in zero-g,
where every cut generated an equal and opposite rotation; how to anchor
yourself with a foot or a hand while striking with the other; how to
read the slow, balletic movements of a zero-g opponent and predict
their trajectory.

Tomás watched from behind the safety barrier, offering commentary that
was half engineering analysis and half cheerful insanity. "Your center
of mass is too high. Drop your hips. No — your actual hips, not your —
okay, that's better. Now when you cut, you need to account for the
angular momentum. Think of it like a torque equation—"

"Tomás."

"Yes?"

"If you say 'torque equation' one more time, I am going to use this
blade on you."

"Understood. Less engineering. More stabbing."

She trained until her arms ached and her reflexes sharpened to the point
where the blade felt like an extension of her hand, where the zero-g
geometry became intuitive, where she could feel the physics in her body
rather than calculating it in her mind. And on Saturday night, the
night before the duel, she sat in the cockpit of the _Red Talon_ with
Tomás and looked out at the stars and said nothing for a long time.

"Are you nervous?" he asked.

"Yes."

"You don't look nervous."

"I'm a pilot. Looking nervous is the one thing we're never allowed to
do." She turned to him. "Tomás, if I lose—"

"You're not going to lose."

"If I lose, the challenge ruling is legally binding. Daria gets
courtship priority. I have to stand down."

"I know what the Charter says."

"And you'd accept that? You'd just — let a sword fight determine your
love life?"

He was quiet for a moment. The starlight through the cockpit canopy
painted his face in pale blue and white, and he looked, in that light,
like something carved from ice and fire and the kind of stubborn
engineering brilliance that makes a person redesign a fusion reactor
three times until it works.

"The Charter is the Charter," he said. "It's what we agreed to when we
came here. All of us. But Zara — " He reached across the gap between
their seats and took her hand. His fingers were warm, calloused, strong
— the hands of a man who built things. "I have never in my life been
interested in water reclamation."

She laughed. It was the laugh of a woman who was afraid and excited and
in love and about to fight a sword duel on the hull of a spaceship,
and it was, she thought, probably the most absurd sound she had ever
made, and she did not care.

"Sunday," she said. "1400 hours."

"I'll be watching."

"Everyone will be watching."

"But I'll be the one who matters."

She squeezed his hand. "Damn right."

                               * * *

Sunday.

The Esperanza hung in standard orbit above Caterina, three hundred
kilometers up — a vast, scarred cylinder, the generation ship that
had carried the colony's founding population on the thirty-year transit
from Earth. It was decommissioned now, stripped of its drive systems,
converted into an orbital platform for storage, manufacturing, and
the occasional public event. Its hull was pitted and weathered by
decades of micrometeorite impacts, its surface a gray-brown landscape
of metal plating, access hatches, and communications arrays.

It was also, Zara reflected as the transport shuttle approached the
designated arena, approximately the most dramatic dueling ground in
human history.

The arena had been marked on the hull's dorsal surface — a circle fifty
meters in diameter, bounded by tether lines and illuminated by
floodlights that turned the metal bright as noon. Beyond the circle, in
every direction, the hull curved away toward the stars. Below — if
"below" had any meaning in orbit — the planet Caterina turned in stately
blue-green beauty, its cloud patterns swirling like cream in coffee.

The audience was everywhere. On the observation deck of the orbital
platform, three hundred colonists crowded the viewports. On the surface,
thousands more watched through the broadcast feed, projected on screens
in every settlement. Small craft — personal shuttles, cargo tugs, a
few brave souls in EVA suits — held station around the Esperanza at a
respectful distance, their running lights blinking like fireflies.

Zara suited up in the transport shuttle's cramped airlock. The EVA suit
was a standard model, modified for combat: lighter armor on the torso,
reinforced joints, magnetic boots that could be toggled on and off for
mobility. The ceremonial blade was sheathed at her hip — a weapon forged
in the colony's foundry, forty centimeters of tempered steel with a
single cutting edge and a basket guard, designed for slashing rather
than thrusting, designed to draw blood without killing.

She toggled the suit comm. "Chen to Arbiter Mensah. Ready."

Arbiter Kojo Mensah's voice came back, deep and formal, with the
ceremonial cadence that the Arbiters used for official proceedings:
"Pilot Chen, you are recognized. Proceed to the arena."

She cycled the airlock and stepped out onto the hull.

The sensation was immediate and overwhelming. The silence. The vastness.
The planet below, impossibly large, impossibly blue. The stars above,
impossibly many, impossibly still. And the hull beneath her magnetic
boots, solid and real and infinitely small against the everything that
surrounded it.

She walked to the arena. The magnetic boots clicked on the hull plating
with each step — a metronomic sound that she focused on to keep her
breathing steady. Ahead, she could see the floodlit circle, the tether
lines, the drone cameras hovering at the perimeter. And on the far side
of the circle, already in position, Daria Venkov.

Daria was tall and lean in her EVA suit, her blade already drawn, its
edge catching the floodlight in a line of white fire. She stood with the
easy confidence of someone who had trained for this — feet planted wide,
weight centered, the blade held in a guard position that Zara recognized
from the Caterina combat manual: the Cascading Orchid, a defensive
stance that invited attack and punished overcommitment.

Zara drew her blade. The steel sang against the sheath — a high, thin
sound that the suit microphone picked up and broadcast to the colony.

Arbiter Mensah's voice, amplified, formal, echoing through every comm
channel on the planet: "Citizens of Caterina. We are gathered to witness
a Formal Challenge of Courtship under Article 17 of the Colonial Charter.
The parties are Pilot First Class Zara Chen, challenger by acceptance,
and Pilot Second Class Daria Venkov, challenger by filing. The subject
of the dispute is Chief Engineer Tomás Reyes, who is present as witness.
The combat will be conducted to first blood or first yield. The Arbiter's
ruling is final."

A pause. Then:

"The Ancestors witness. The Colony endures. Begin."

Daria moved first.

In atmosphere, the attack would have been fast — a lunging cut aimed at
Zara's lead arm, the kind of opening gambit designed to test reflexes
and establish range. In zero-g, on the hull of a ship, it was something
else entirely. Daria deactivated her magnetic boots and launched herself
across the arena in a low, flat trajectory, her blade sweeping in a
horizontal arc that converted her forward momentum into rotational
energy.

Zara had been waiting for this — Daria's aggressive opening was
well-known on the training circuit — and she was ready. She toggled her
own boots off, pushed away from the hull at a perpendicular angle, and
let Daria's cut pass beneath her with centimeters to spare. The blade
whispered past her suit, close enough to feel the faint tug of displaced
air — or what would have been displaced air, had there been air to
displace.

They separated, tumbling in slow, controlled arcs, and the arena
cameras tracked them against the starfield — two suited figures
spinning among the stars, blades bright, the planet turning below
them in unhurried splendor.

Zara stabilized first. She caught a tether line with her free hand,
arrested her rotation, and used the line as a pivot to redirect her
momentum back toward Daria. The maneuver was a pilot's trick — she
had spent three years calculating orbital trajectories, and trajectory
was trajectory whether you were flying a ship or throwing your own
body at an armed opponent.

She came in fast, blade forward, and Daria met her with a parry that
rang through both their suits — metal on metal, the vibration traveling
up Zara's arm and into her shoulder. They locked, face to face through
their helmets, drifting in a slow spin as Newton's third law worked out
the math.

"You're good," Daria said, her voice clear on the combat channel.

"You're better at small talk than I expected."

Daria grinned behind her faceplate. "We talk about water reclamation
on dates. Small talk is my strength."

She twisted, breaking the lock, and slashed. The blade caught Zara's
suit on the upper arm — not deep enough to breach, but enough to score
a visible line in the suit material. Close. Too close.

Zara pushed away, recalculated, and came back.

The duel lasted eleven minutes. Eleven minutes of zero-gravity
ballet, blade work, and physics — two pilots who understood trajectory
and angular momentum using that understanding to turn a ceremonial
combat into something that four thousand people would talk about for
years. They fought across the hull, off the hull, in arcing leaps
that carried them meters above the metal surface before momentum
brought them back. They clashed and separated, tested and retreated,
pushed each other to the limits of their skill and their suits'
maneuvering capability.

In the end, it came down to a trick that Tomás had suggested during
training — an engineering trick, naturally.

Zara was in a defensive position, her back to the hull, Daria pressing
the attack from above. Daria had the advantage — height, reach, momentum.
She was driving Zara back toward the tether boundary, where the arena
ended and the void began. One more exchange, and Zara would either
yield or be forced out of bounds.

Zara activated her magnetic boots. Both of them. Full power.

The boots locked onto the hull with a force that would have been
uncomfortable under gravity and was, in zero-g, an anchor — absolute,
immovable, a fixed point in a universe of floating. Daria's next attack
was built on the assumption that Zara would retreat, would absorb the
momentum, would drift. Instead, Zara was a wall.

She caught Daria's blade on her own, deflected it with a sharp twist
of the wrist, and brought her own blade across in a compact, vicious
cut that used the hull anchor as leverage. The tip of her blade touched
Daria's suit at the hip — not hard, not deep, but enough.

A thin line of red floated free from the scored suit fabric. A single
droplet of blood, drifting in zero-g, catching the floodlight as it
tumbled into the void. First blood.

The arena was silent for one heartbeat. Two. Then the comm channels
exploded — cheering, shouting, the collective noise of four thousand
people who had been holding their breath and were now letting it go in
a single, cathartic roar.

Arbiter Mensah's voice, cutting through the celebration: "First blood is
scored. The challenge is resolved in favor of Pilot First Class Zara
Chen. The ruling is final and binding. The Ancestors witness. The Colony
endures."

Zara deactivated her boots. She sheathed her blade. She drifted in the
silence of the hull, surrounded by stars, the planet turning below her,
and she felt — not triumph, not relief, but something larger and simpler.
The feeling of having fought for something and won it, of having been
afraid and done it anyway, of having stood on the hull of a generation
ship in the void of space and said, with a blade and her body and every
ounce of stubborn pilot's nerve she possessed: this is mine.

She turned to Daria. Daria was holding her hip, where the suit's
emergency sealant was already patching the cut. Through her faceplate,
her expression was — not angry. Not defeated. Something else.

"Good fight, Chen."

"Good fight, Venkov."

"Take care of him."

"I will."

Daria nodded once. Then she toggled her boots and walked back across
the hull, and the drone cameras followed her, and the audience watched,
and the colony continued, as colonies do, to endure.

                               * * *

Tomás was waiting in the transport shuttle when Zara came through the
airlock. She unsealed her helmet, pulled it off, and stood there —
sweaty, exhausted, still vibrating with adrenaline — and looked at him.

He looked at her. The half-smile. The brightening. The unconscious
straightening.

"You fought a sword duel on the hull of a spaceship," he said. "For me."

"I did."

"In front of four thousand people."

"Four thousand two hundred. The Arbiter's estimate was accurate."

"Zara Chen." He stepped forward. He put his hands on her face — gently,
carefully, with the precision of a man who built things and understood
that the best things were also the most fragile. "You are the most
terrifying woman I have ever met."

"Is that a compliment?"

"It is the highest compliment I know how to give."

She kissed him. In the cramped airlock of a transport shuttle, in orbit
above a colony world where courtship was settled by the blade, with the
taste of recycled air and adrenaline and the faint copper tang of
someone else's blood still on the comm channel — she kissed him, and he
kissed her back, and outside the viewport the stars burned in the ancient
and indifferent way that stars do, but which, in that particular moment,
felt a great deal like applause.

                            [THE END]

                       VALENTINE VIRUS

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

The trouble began, as most trouble does, with good intentions.

Martin Cobb was a systems engineer at SolComm Central — the vast
communications hub in geostationary orbit above Ecuador that routed
approximately ninety-seven percent of the solar system's civilian
message traffic. He was forty-four years old, divorced, and possessed
of the particular combination of technical brilliance and social
awkwardness that made him indispensable to the network and slightly
bewildering to his colleagues. He was also, on the morning of February
13th, 2087, heartbroken.

The heartbreak was recent, specific, and — in Martin's professional
opinion — unfair. Dr. Elena Vasquez, a xenolinguist stationed on the
Ganymede Research Platform, had ended their two-year relationship via a
twelve-word text message: "Martin, this isn't working. I need someone
who talks to me."

Martin had stared at the message for a long time. He talked to her
constantly — about network architecture, about signal propagation
delays, about the elegant recursive algorithms that kept the solar
system's communication infrastructure functioning. What more was there
to talk about?

In the days following the breakup, Martin did what he always did when
faced with a problem he couldn't solve through conventional channels:
he wrote a program.

The program was meant to be a Valentine's Day greeting — a digital card
that would be delivered to Elena's personal comm on February 14th,
expressing sentiments that Martin found easier to encode than to speak.
It was, in his estimation, elegant: a self-executing message package
wrapped in an animated display of binary hearts (which he thought was
romantic and which most people would have found alarming), accompanied
by a text message that read: "I am bad at talking about feelings. But I
am good at systems. And you are the most important system in my life.
Please reconsider."

The problem — and Martin would analyze this problem obsessively in the
months that followed, tracing the cascade of errors with the meticulous
attention of a man disassembling his own catastrophe — was that he built
the card using the tools available to him. Which were not consumer-grade
greeting-card tools. They were SolComm's proprietary message routing
protocols, the same protocols that governed the routing of every
civilian communication in the solar system.

The second problem was a bug.

Specifically, a bug in the card's delivery subroutine. Martin had
written the subroutine to locate Elena's personal comm address in the
SolComm directory and deliver the card at midnight UTC on February 14th.
What the subroutine actually did — due to a misplaced conditional
operator that Martin would later describe as "the most expensive typo
in human history" — was locate every personal comm address in the
SolComm directory and deliver the card to all of them.

All of them.

Every personal communication device registered with SolComm Central —
which was, as of February 14th, 2087, approximately 11.4 billion
devices, distributed across Earth, the Moon, Mars, the asteroid belt,
and the outer planet stations.

But the card's delivery was only the beginning of the problem. Because
the card didn't just deliver itself. It also, thanks to a second bug in
a secondary subroutine that Martin had written while sleep-deprived and
emotionally compromised, rerouted the recipient's most recent outgoing
message to a randomly selected address in their contact list.

Every message in the system. Rerouted. At random. On Valentine's Day.

                               * * *

The first reports came in at 00:03 UTC.

Martin was asleep in his quarters at SolComm Central when the alarm
klaxon sounded — the deep, throbbing pulse that meant a Category One
network anomaly. He scrambled out of bed, pulled on his uniform, and
ran to the operations center, where he found his colleagues staring at
their monitoring screens with the expressions of people watching a
building collapse in slow motion.

"What's happening?" he asked, already knowing, with the sick certainty
of a man who can feel his own fingerprints on the disaster.

His supervisor, Chief Network Officer Priya Desai, turned to him. She
was a small, calm woman who had managed SolComm's operations through
three solar flares, a cyberattack, and the Great Mars Bandwidth Crisis
of '83. She did not look calm now.

"Every message in the system is being rerouted," she said. "Every single
one. Personal, commercial, governmental — everything. The routing
tables have been overwritten by some kind of self-propagating code. It's
spreading through the relay network faster than we can isolate it."

"How is that possible?"

"That's what I need you to tell me, Martin." She fixed him with a look
that suggested she was already forming hypotheses about how it was
possible and that several of those hypotheses featured his name
prominently. "Get to your station. Find the source. Kill it."

Martin got to his station. He began tracing the code. And within twelve
minutes, he found his own digital signature embedded in the virus's
propagation protocol, and he understood, with a clarity that was almost
beautiful in its horror, exactly what he had done.

He had built a Valentine's card that had eaten the solar system's
communication network.

                               * * *

Meanwhile, across the solar system, the consequences were unfolding.

On Earth, in a brownstone apartment in Brooklyn, Margaret Okonkwo
received a message on her personal comm that she had not been meant to
see. It was from her husband, David, and it was addressed to her sister,
Nina. It read: "I've been thinking about what you said at dinner. You're
right — I should have married you instead."

Margaret read this message. She read it again. Then she called her
husband, who was at work in Manhattan, and the conversation that followed
was audible, according to later reports, from two floors away.

On Mars, at the Valles Marineris Research Station, Commander Greta
Holmberg received a message intended for the Colonial Administration's
Budgetary Committee. It was from the Administrator himself, and it
contained a detailed breakdown of the station's funding allocation,
including the line item that revealed the Administration had been
systematically underfunding the Martian colonies' life-support
maintenance budget by fourteen percent for the past three years,
redirecting the funds to a classified project on Titan.

Commander Holmberg was not supposed to see this message. She shared it
with her entire station. The station shared it with Mars. Mars shared it
with Earth. The resulting political scandal would eventually bring down
the Colonial Administrator and trigger the most significant reform of
interplanetary governance in a generation.

On the asteroid belt mining platform Cerberus-7, miner Jack Dufresne
received a love poem. It was not addressed to him — it was addressed to
someone named "My Dearest Comet" — and it was from his bunkmate, Hiro
Tanaka, who had been writing poetry in secret for three years and whose
creative output, now accidentally revealed, included forty-seven sonnets,
twelve haiku cycles, and an epic poem about the asteroid belt that was,
according to the literary critics who would later review it, "genuinely
excellent — passionate, technically assured, and possessed of a vision
of the industrial sublime that the genre has long needed."

Jack read the poem. He went to Hiro's bunk. "You wrote this?" he said.

Hiro, who had turned the color of a Martian sunset, could not speak.

"It's beautiful," Jack said. "Who's 'My Dearest Comet'?"

Hiro looked at him. Jack looked at Hiro. The mining platform Cerberus-7
was not known for its romantic atmosphere — it smelled of metal shavings
and recycled air and the particular industrial bleakness of a place
where people worked twelve-hour shifts in vacuum suits — but in that
moment, in that bunk room, romance bloomed with the tenacity of a weed
cracking through concrete.

"Oh," Jack said.

"I'm sorry," Hiro whispered. "I never meant for you to — "

"Don't be sorry." Jack sat down on the bunk. "Read me another one."

On Ganymede, Dr. Elena Vasquez received thirty-seven messages that were
not meant for her, including a budget report from the Lunar Mining
Consortium, a breakup letter from a teenager in São Paulo to her
boyfriend in Jakarta, and a recipe for lemon cake from someone's
grandmother on the Moon. She also received Martin's Valentine card, with
its binary hearts and its plea for reconsideration, and she stared at it
for a very long time.

And on the orbital station above Titan, Communications Officer Yusuf
Barre received a message that was intended for the woman he had been in
love with for two years and had never told: his colleague, Dr. Amara
Diallo, who worked in the next compartment and who he saw every day and
with whom he had maintained a relationship of scrupulous professionalism
that concealed, on his side, a devotion so complete that it colored
everything he did.

The message was from Amara. It was addressed to her sister on Earth. It
read: "I don't know what to do about Yusuf. I think I'm in love with
him and I think he has no idea and I think I'm going to lose my mind."

Yusuf read this message. He read it several times. Then he stood up from
his station, walked to Amara's compartment, knocked on the door, and
when she opened it, said: "I have an idea."

"About what?"

"About how you're going to lose your mind."

Amara stared at him. "How did you — "

"The network is rerouting everything. I got a message. Your message."

The blood drained from Amara's face. Then it came back, all at once,
in a rush of color that was visible even in the station's fluorescent
lighting. "Oh God."

"Amara."

"I am going to die of embarrassment. Right here. On this station.
Tell my sister — "

"Amara. I love you too."

She stopped. The station hummed around them. Titan turned below them,
vast and orange and wholly indifferent to the emotional lives of the
tiny beings orbiting it.

"You do?"

"I have for two years."

"Two years?"

"I'm not good at — I didn't know how to — the protocols — "

"Yusuf."

"Yes?"

"Stop talking about protocols and kiss me."

He did.

                               * * *

Back at SolComm Central, Martin Cobb was having the worst day of his
professional life.

The virus — they were calling it a virus now, which was technically
inaccurate but emotionally appropriate — had propagated through the
entire relay network in under two hours. Every communication hub from
Mercury to Neptune was affected. Messages were crossing the solar system
in patterns that bore no relationship to their intended destinations.
Love letters were reaching strangers. Business contracts were arriving
at the wrong corporations. Diplomatic cables were being delivered to
journalists. Military communications were appearing on civilian channels.

The system, in short, was a mess. And Martin, having identified himself
as the source, was sitting in Chief Desai's office, explaining.

"A Valentine card," Desai said, in the flat, controlled tone of a woman
who was considering several different ways to end Martin's career and
was merely choosing the most efficient.

"A Valentine card."

"You built a self-propagating code package using SolComm's proprietary
routing protocols. To send a Valentine card."

"It wasn't supposed to propagate. There was a bug."

"A bug."

"A misplaced conditional operator in the delivery subroutine."

"Martin. You have crashed the solar system's communication network with
a typo."

"That is — yes. That is an accurate summary."

Desai closed her eyes. She opened them. "Can you stop it?"

"I'm working on a patch. The propagation protocol is recursive — it
keeps replicating because each node that receives the code passes it
to adjacent nodes. If I can inject a kill command at the hub level, I
can terminate the recursion and restore the original routing tables
from backup."

"How long?"

"Six hours. Maybe eight."

"Eight hours during which every message in the solar system is being
delivered to the wrong person."

"Yes."

Desai looked at him. The look contained multitudes, none of them
favorable. "Do it. Fix it. And Martin — "

"Yes?"

"When this is over, you and I are going to have a conversation about
appropriate use of company infrastructure. And that conversation is
going to involve words like 'termination' and 'legal liability' and
'what in the name of God were you thinking.'"

"Yes, ma'am."

He went back to his station and began writing the patch.

                               * * *

It took seven hours.

Seven hours during which the solar system rearranged its secrets, its
confessions, its lies, and its love letters into new configurations that
no one had intended and that no one could undo. Seven hours during which
grudges were accidentally exposed and accidentally forgiven, during which
affairs were revealed and relationships ended and new ones began, during
which the vast, complex, meticulously ordered network of human
communication was stirred like a pot of soup and the ingredients settled
in new and unpredictable arrangements.

At 07:14 UTC on February 14th, Martin Cobb's kill command propagated
through the relay network, terminating the recursive code and restoring
the original routing tables. The system stabilized. Messages began
flowing to their correct destinations. The solar system exhaled.

The aftermath was complicated.

On Earth, the Okonkwo family entered counseling. David Okonkwo
maintained that the message to Nina had been "taken out of context."
No one believed him, but the counselor was good, and eighteen months
later, the marriage was stronger than it had been before. Nina, for
her part, met someone at a dinner party and was very happy.

On Mars, the revelations about the underfunded life-support budget led
to a full audit of the Colonial Administration, the resignation of the
Administrator, and the establishment of an independent oversight
committee. Commander Holmberg was offered the Administrator's job. She
declined, saying she preferred to stay where the air was thin and the
bureaucrats were far away.

On Cerberus-7, Hiro Tanaka published his asteroid belt poetry collection,
"Songs for the Void," which won the Interplanetary Literary Prize and
sold three hundred thousand copies. Jack Dufresne attended the award
ceremony as his date. They were married the following spring, in a
ceremony held in zero gravity, which Hiro described in a poem that
became, briefly, the most shared piece of writing in the solar system.

On Titan, Yusuf Barre and Amara Diallo were assigned to a joint
research project that required extensive collaboration and close
quarters. Their supervisor, who had been watching them orbit each other
for two years with the exasperated patience of a woman who knew how the
story was going to end, approved the assignment without comment.

On Ganymede, Elena Vasquez sent a reply to Martin Cobb. It read: "I
saw the binary hearts. They were very you. I'm not coming back, Martin.
But I want you to know: you do talk about your feelings. You just do it
in code. Find someone who speaks your language."

Martin read the message at his station at SolComm Central, where he was
serving the first day of a two-week suspension (with pay, because he was
too valuable to fire and too dangerous to leave unsupervised near the
network). He read it, and he felt — not the heartbreak he had been
expecting, but something else. A release. A letting go. The particular
relief of a man who had crashed an entire civilization's communication
system and, in the wreckage, found something that almost looked like
clarity.

He looked at his console. The network was running cleanly — every
message reaching its intended destination, every signal finding its
proper path. The system was restored. The order was back.

But the disorder had left its marks. Across the solar system, in
apartments and offices and mining platforms and orbital stations, people
were having conversations they had been avoiding, reading messages they
were never meant to see, confronting truths they had kept carefully
hidden. The virus was gone, but its effects persisted, rippling outward
through human lives in patterns that no routing algorithm could predict
or control.

Martin leaned back in his chair. The operations center hummed around
him — the quiet, purposeful sound of a system working as intended. Through
the observation window, the Earth turned below, blue and white and
impossibly beautiful, wrapped in the invisible web of signals that
connected every human being on its surface and beyond.

Somewhere in that web, a love poem was being read aloud. Somewhere, a
secret was being confessed. Somewhere, two people who had been afraid
to speak were speaking. The virus had forced the issue — had torn
through the careful partitions between public and private, between
intended and unintended, between the things we mean to say and the
things we actually feel — and in the ruins, improbably, awkwardly,
and with the peculiar grace that catastrophe sometimes brings, people
were connecting.

Happy Valentine's Day, Martin thought.

And then he went back to work, because the network needed tending, and
love, like communication, was a system that required constant
maintenance, and he was, for all his faults, a very good engineer.

                            [THE END]

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

MARGARET THORNTON holds a master's degree in marine biology from the
University of Washington and has conducted fieldwork on tide pool ecology
in locations ranging from Puget Sound to the coast of Norway. She began
writing science fiction in 1949 and has published stories in Astounding,
Galaxy, and these pages, where she has become one of our most valued
contributors. "Species Barrier" represents a new direction for her —
she describes it as "a love story told entirely in data, which is, I
think, how a biologist would fall in love with someone she could never
observe directly." She lives on an island in the Pacific Northwest,
where she studies the interconnectedness of living systems and writes
about what she calls "the intelligence of collaboration." She is
currently at work on a novel.

DOUGLAS PEMBERTON is a humorist, essayist, and self-described "reluctant
science fiction writer" whose stories have appeared in Punch, The New
Yorker, Galaxy, and these pages. A graduate of Balliol College, Oxford,
and a veteran of the Royal Navy (where he was, by his own account,
"spectacularly incompetent at everything except morale"), he lives in
Surrey with his wife Penelope, three dogs, and a parrot that can recite
the opening of "The War of the Worlds." Of "My Darling Clementine 9000,"
he says: "I set out to write a comedy about a shipping error and
accidentally wrote a love story. This seems to happen to me rather often.
Penelope says it is because I am fundamentally sentimental and lack the
courage to admit it. She is, as always, correct."

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW studied philosophy and logic at the University of
Pennsylvania and has been writing about time travel, temporal paradox,
and the things we cannot undo since 1953. Her stories have appeared in
Astounding, Galaxy, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and
these pages. She won a Hugo Award for "All Our Yesterdays, Revised"
(Issue #32) and has been nominated three additional times. "The Ghost
and Mrs. Nakamura" is, she says, "the saddest story I have ever written,
and also the truest. Every marriage is a time loop of sorts — we
return, again and again, to the same moments, the same conversations,
the same kitchen. The difference is that most of us don't know which
Tuesday is the last." She lives in Philadelphia with her husband David
and two children.

GUNNAR ERIKSSON has been writing about the void between stars since 1954,
when his first story for these pages, "Long Watch," prompted a fan
letter from Ray Bradbury. Born in Stockholm, he writes in English while
living his life in Swedish, and his stories have been translated into
fourteen languages. He works as a literary translator and publishes, by
his own admission, "at the speed of a glacier — slow, but hopefully
leaving marks." "Letter from a Distant Star" is his most personal work,
inspired, he says, by "the Swedish tradition of writing letters that
will never be answered, which is, when you think about it, the purest
form of communication — a message sent for the sake of sending, without
expectation of reply." He lives in Stockholm with his wife Ingrid.

REX DRUMMOND is the pen name of a former bomber pilot, sometime rancher,
and full-time teller of tales whose stories have appeared in Planet
Stories, Thrilling Wonder Stories, Startling Stories, and these pages.
He is the author of six novels, most recently "The Corsairs of Cygnus"
(Ace Books, 1955), and he holds the distinction of being the only
contributor to this magazine who has been asked to leave a convention
hotel for staging an impromptu fencing demonstration in the lobby. Of
"Dueling Hearts," he says: "I've been writing about people who fight
for twenty years. It occurred to me that I'd never written about what
they fight for. Turns out the answer is usually the same: somebody they
love. Also, I wanted to write a sword fight in zero gravity, and by
God, I did." He lives in San Diego.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, having published stories in nearly every issue since our
inaugural number. A former autoworker, infantryman, and technical writer,
he brings a journeyman's versatility to every assignment and a
Detroiter's conviction that reliability is a virtue. "The Valentine
Virus" is his first foray into romantic comedy, which he describes as
"a systems failure story that happens to involve feelings, which are,
in my experience, the least reliable system of all." He lives in
Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean and their three children, and
he reports that he is already at work on his next story for us.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I write to express my deep admiration for Dr. Koslov's "The Cold
Collector" in your November issue (#35). The description of the
derelict probe's slow accumulation of interstellar hydrogen over three
centuries is the most poetic piece of hard science fiction I have read
this year. Dr. Koslov makes the patient physics of the void feel not
merely comprehensible but sacred. I particularly admired the final
scene, in which the probe's data is received by an Earth that has
forgotten it was ever sent. What a beautiful metaphor for the
loneliness of pure science. More Koslov, please — always more Koslov.

                              — Dr. Helen Cartwright
                                 Department of Astronomy
                                 Radcliffe College, Cambridge, Mass.

Dear Max,

Drummond's "Blood and Starlight" (#35) is pure Drummond — fast, loud,
and gloriously irresponsible. I read it in one sitting and immediately
read it again, which is either high praise or a symptom of a medical
condition. The scene where Captain Rennick rides the hull of the
crippled destroyer through the atmosphere is physically impossible,
emotionally magnificent, and exactly the kind of thing your magazine
does better than anyone else. My only complaint is that Drummond killed
off Lieutenant Vasquez, who was the most interesting woman in the story
and who deserved better than a heroic sacrifice in chapter four. Tell
Drummond I said so. He won't care, but tell him anyway.

Dear Sterling,

I must take issue with a detail in Crenshaw's otherwise excellent
"The Tuesday Equation" (Issue #36, December 1955). Mrs. Crenshaw's
temporal mechanics are, as always, ingenious, but the assertion that a
causal loop can be sustained indefinitely without energy input
contradicts the second law of thermodynamics. Even in a closed temporal
system, entropy must increase. The loop would degrade. I have enclosed
a mathematical proof demonstrating this, which I hope Mrs. Crenshaw
will find interesting rather than irritating.

                              — Prof. Arthur Shimizu
                                 Department of Physics
                                 University of California, Berkeley

Mrs. Crenshaw replies: "Professor Shimizu's proof is elegant and
correct. I am delighted to note, however, that it applies only to
closed temporal systems. My loops are open at one end. This is a
feature, not a bug."                                         — P.C.

Dear Sir,

I am thirteen years old and I have read every issue of your magazine
since Issue #24. I want to be a writer like Miss Thornton when I grow
up. Her story "The Root Network" in Issue #36 made me go to the library
and read a book about mycorrhizal fungi, which is the most interesting
thing I have ever learned about. Can you tell Miss Thornton that I
drew a picture of the fungal network from her story and my science
teacher put it on the wall? Thank you.

                              — Sarah Beth Knowles
                                 Corvallis, Oregon

Miss Thornton replies: "Dear Sarah Beth, your letter is the best thing
I have received all year. Keep reading. Keep drawing. Keep asking the
soil what it knows."                                        — M.T.

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

THE STAR BEAST by Robert A. Heinlein
(Charles Scribner's Sons, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Heinlein has given us another splendid juvenile — though the word
"juvenile" does this novel a disservice, as it is perfectly enjoyable
for readers of any age. Young John Thomas Stuart inherits Lummox, a
creature of obscure alien origin, from his great-grandfather, and the
complications that ensue when Lummox turns out to be considerably more
important than anyone suspected make for a fine tale of diplomatic
misunderstanding, adolescent determination, and the eternal human
tendency to underestimate the beings we live with. Mr. Heinlein writes
for young readers with the same respect and intelligence he brings to
his adult work, and the result is a novel that entertains, instructs,
and delights in equal measure. Recommended.

LONG TOMORROW by Leigh Brackett
(Doubleday, 1955, $3.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Miss Brackett, long celebrated for her planetary romances, here turns
her considerable talents to a very different kind of story: a post-
apocalyptic novel set in a future America where technology has been
banned and cities are forbidden by constitutional amendment. Two young
cousins seek out the legendary hidden city of Bartorstown, where
science is said to survive, and their journey is both a coming-of-age
adventure and a profound meditation on humanity's ambivalent
relationship with its own inventiveness. The prose is spare, the pacing
masterful, and the moral questions — Can we trust ourselves with
knowledge? Should progress be feared or embraced? — are explored with
a maturity and nuance that elevates the novel well above the usual
post-apocalyptic fare. Highly recommended.

THE END OF ETERNITY by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1955, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Dr. Asimov, that most prolific and reliable of our field's practitioners,
here ventures into time travel territory with characteristically
ambitious results. The Eternals — a corps of temporal engineers who
manipulate human history to minimize suffering — discover that their
well-intentioned interventions may be preventing humanity from reaching
the stars. The paradoxes are dizzying, the logic crystalline, and the
central moral question — Is safety worth the cost of greatness? — is
handled with the seriousness it deserves. The novel's romantic subplot
is less successful (Dr. Asimov's women remain his weakness as a writer),
but the intellectual architecture is magnificent. Recommended for
anyone who enjoys having their assumptions about progress, safety, and
the nature of time thoroughly dismantled.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #39 — March 1956

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue, which will
be on newsstands in late February:

"THE THERMAL PROPHET" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A solar physicist aboard
a research station in close orbit around Mercury discovers anomalous
patterns in the sun's coronal activity that suggest the star is
communicating. With whom, and why, is the question that drives Koslov's
most ambitious story yet.

"THE INHERITANCE OF DUST" by Margaret Thornton — On a dying colony
world, a botanist discovers that the native soil contains organisms
capable of rewriting human DNA — and that the planet may be trying to
adapt its colonists to itself, rather than the other way around.

"HARD BURN" by Rex Drummond — When a racing pilot discovers that the
interplanetary Grand Prix has been fixed by a Martian gambling syndicate,
she decides to win it anyway — at speeds that no sane pilot would
attempt and in a ship held together by stubbornness and emergency
sealant. Hold on tight.

"THE SECOND FILING" by Phyllis Crenshaw — A divorce lawyer discovers
that her client has been married to the same man in three different
timelines, and that the divorce must be filed in all three simultaneously
to be valid. A comedy of temporal jurisprudence.

Plus: a new story by Arthur Wainwright, letters from our readers, book
reviews, and more.
