TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITORS' DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

The cost of conflict is not counted in the numbers that appear on
the evening news.

We write this letter in a season of escalation. The war in Vietnam
dominates every front page, every broadcast, every conversation at
every dinner table in America. The numbers arrive daily -- body
counts, sortie counts, hamlet assessments, pacification percentages --
and they are delivered with the crisp authority of actuarial tables, as
though war were an accounting problem and victory a matter of reaching
the correct column in a ledger. We are told that the numbers add up.
We are told that progress is being made. We are told to trust the
arithmetic.

But numbers, as any scientist will tell you, are only as honest as the
people who compile them. And war, as any veteran will tell you, does
not reduce to arithmetic. The dead do not care whether they appear in
the correct column. The wounded do not heal faster because a
percentage has been rounded up. The villages that burn are not
unburned by a revised estimate.

This issue of "Tales from the Future and Beyond" is about the cost of
conflict -- not in distant galaxies or on imagined battlefields, though
our stories wear those costumes, but here, now, in the moral landscape
we all inhabit. Every story in these pages asks, in its own way, what
war does to truth, to mercy, to the systems we build and the feelings
we permit ourselves to have. We did not plan this thematic unity; it
emerged from the stories themselves, as though six writers working
independently had all looked up at the same sky and seen the same
storm gathering.

Colonel Stanton leads this issue with "Fictitious Numbers," and we
must tell you plainly: it is the rawest, most personal story he has
ever written for these pages. A military statistician discovers that
the victory numbers flowing upward through the chain of command bear
no relationship to reality -- that they are generated by an algorithm
designed to produce whatever the generals need to justify the next
escalation. It is a story about the machinery of institutional
dishonesty, and it is written with the authority of a man who has seen
that machinery from the inside. We asked Buck if the story was
autobiographical. His reply, in its entirety, was: "Close enough."

Margaret Thornton gives us "Ecology of Fear," her darkest ecological
story and one of the most disturbing pieces of fiction we have
published. A colony planet's ecosystem runs not on competition or
cooperation but on terror -- every organism in perpetual, driving
fear. When scientists attempt to remove the fear, the ecology does
not become peaceful. It dies. Fear, Thornton suggests, is not a flaw
in the system. It is the system. We leave it to you to decide whether
she is writing about an alien world or this one.

Julian St. Croix contributes "Dreamers' Republic," his most
psychedelic and, we believe, his most moving work. Lucid dreamers
sharing a single dreamscape create a democratic society within the
dream, where the laws of physics are decided by vote. When one
dreamer refuses to wake, choosing the dream over reality, the others
must follow or abandon their creation. It is St. Croix at his most
baroque and his most humane, and it asks the question that hangs over
every utopian project: what happens when someone loves the dream too
much to leave it?

Theodore Cain offers "Unlicensed Feeling," a story about a pharmacist
who secretly reduces the mood-stabilizer dosages in a controlled
society, allowing residents to feel full, unregulated emotions for the
first time. The result is not the liberation the pharmacist hoped for
but chaos: fights, love affairs, art, and a suicide. Is medicated
peace still peace? Cain's answer is characteristically honest and
characteristically ambiguous.

Oscar Lennox gives us "Librarian of Ruins," set in an alternate 1962
in which the Cuban Missile Crisis ended in nuclear exchange. A
librarian in the aftermath preserves salvaged books, but each book is
both treasure and provocation -- the community is divided between
those who want to learn from the old world and those who want to
forget it entirely. It is Lennox at his most historically grounded,
and his most politically urgent.

Miriam Blackwell closes the issue with "Frequency of Mercy," a story
that may be the most morally challenging piece of fiction we have ever
published. A telepath at a war-crimes tribunal reads the minds of
perpetrators and discovers, in almost every one, alongside the cruelty:
hesitation. Doubt. Self-horror. Moments of internal resistance that
flickered and went out. Do those moments matter? Does a conscience
that flinches but does not act constitute redemption -- or does it
make the crime worse? We have been arguing about this story for weeks,
and we have not reached a conclusion. We suspect you will argue too.

Six stories. Six examinations of what conflict costs. We offer them
not as answers but as the questions we believe must be asked.

In this season of numbers, we choose to count differently.

Yours in troubled times,

                        FICTITIOUS NUMBERS

               by Col. James "Buck" Stanton (Ret.)

================================================================================

                               I.

The morning briefing smelled like burnt coffee and lies.

Colonel Nathan Hale Cotter stood at the back of the room in the
Combined Military Analysis Center, Saigon -- which everyone called
the Counting House, though no one could remember who'd named it that
-- and watched Major Davis run through the weekly attrition figures
with the smooth, practiced delivery of a man selling encyclopedias
door to door. Cotter had sold encyclopedias, once, the summer after
his junior year at Texas A&M, and he recognized the technique: state
the number with absolute confidence, move to the next number before
anyone can question the first, and never, ever let the rhythm break.

"Confirmed enemy KIA, Quang Tri Province: four hundred twelve. Probable
enemy KIA: one hundred seventy-eight. Weapons captured: two hundred
forty-one. Structures destroyed: sixty-seven. Pacification index,
composite: sixty-eight point four, up three points from the previous
reporting period."

Cotter wrote the numbers in his notebook. He had been writing numbers
in notebooks for twenty-three years, first as a mathematics instructor
at West Point, then as an operations research analyst in Korea, and
now as the head of the Statistical Verification Section, a unit of
eleven men whose job was to make sure the numbers flowing up the chain
of command bore some relationship to what was actually happening on
the ground.

He was fifty-one years old. He had a bad knee from a jeep accident
in Pusan, a wife in San Antonio who wrote him every Tuesday, and a
reputation as the most meticulous number man in the United States
Army. People called him "the Auditor," and they did not mean it as
a compliment. Nobody likes an auditor.

Major Davis finished his presentation. Brigadier General Wheaton, who
ran the briefing, nodded the way generals nod -- a slight downward
motion of the chin that conveyed approval without committing to
anything specific -- and said, "Questions?"

There were never questions. The briefing was a ceremony, not a
conversation. The numbers went into the slides, the slides went into
the briefing, the briefing went to MACV headquarters, headquarters
sent them to the Pentagon, the Pentagon sent them to the White House,
and the White House sent them to the press. At each stage, the numbers
acquired additional authority, like a rumor gaining detail as it
passed from mouth to mouth, until by the time they reached the
American public they had the weight of scripture.

Cotter raised his hand.

General Wheaton looked at him the way a man looks at a fly that has
landed on his steak.

"Colonel Cotter."

"Sir, I'd like to ask Major Davis about the methodology behind the
Quang Tri figures."

The room went quiet. Not the quiet of attention but the quiet of
embarrassment, the way a dinner party goes quiet when someone
mentions the hostess's drinking.

Davis smiled. "Happy to clarify, Colonel. What specifically?"

"The confirmed KIA figure. Four hundred twelve. That's up from two
hundred thirty-one the previous week, which was up from one hundred
eighty-seven the week before. That's a compounding increase of
approximately thirty-seven percent per week sustained over three
reporting periods."

"Reflecting increased operational tempo in the province, Colonel."

"Operational tempo in Quang Tri has been constant for five weeks.
I checked with Third Marine Division G-3 this morning. Same number
of patrols, same areas of operation, same unit strength. So the
question is: how are we killing seventy-eight percent more enemy
with the same operational input?"

The silence changed quality. It was no longer embarrassment. It was
the silence of men calculating how much trouble this was going to
cause.

Davis looked at Wheaton. Wheaton looked at Cotter.

"Colonel, I think you may be reading too much into normal statistical
variation."

"Sir, a seventy-eight percent increase is not normal statistical
variation. It's either a genuine change in enemy activity -- which
would show up in the contact reports, and it doesn't -- or it's an
error in the collection methodology."

Wheaton's jaw tightened. "We'll take that under advisement. Next
item."

Cotter sat down and wrote in his notebook: QT figures anomalous.
Methodology question deflected. Follow up.

He had been writing notes like this for six months. The notebook was
almost full.


                              II.

Cotter's office was a partitioned space in a corrugated-metal
building that had been designed as a warehouse and converted to
administrative use by the simple expedient of adding fluorescent
lights and pretending the heat was tolerable. His desk was a gray
steel government-issue model, his chair was a gray steel
government-issue model, and the filing cabinets lining the walls
were gray steel government-issue models. The only personal touch
was a framed photograph of his wife, Louise, standing in front of
their house in San Antonio, squinting into the sun with one hand
shading her eyes.

Captain Sarah Engel knocked on the partition frame and came in
without waiting for an answer. She was his best analyst -- a
twenty-seven-year-old mathematician from MIT who had been drafted
into the Army's operations research program and who possessed the
dangerous combination of a first-rate mind and an inability to
pretend she didn't see what she saw.

"I ran the regression you asked for," she said, dropping a manila
folder on his desk. "The Quang Tri numbers. Also Binh Dinh, Phu
Yen, and Kontum."

"And?"

"They're fictional."

Cotter looked at her. "That's a strong word, Captain."

"It's the accurate word, sir." She pulled a chair around to his
side of the desk and opened the folder. Inside were graphs --
hand-drawn, because the computer time they'd been allocated had
been cut in half three months ago, and Engel drew better graphs
than the computer anyway.

"Look at the pattern. Four provinces, four different reporting
chains, four different unit commands. You'd expect the KIA figures
to be noisy -- different terrain, different enemy strength, different
operational conditions. Instead, they track."

She pointed to the lines on the graph. They rose in near-perfect
parallel, like railroad tracks climbing a hill.

"Same rate of increase?"

"Within two percent. For nine consecutive weeks. The probability of
that occurring naturally, across four independent data streams, is --"
She paused, and Cotter saw her choosing between the technical answer
and the plain one. She chose the plain one. "It's not possible, sir.
These numbers aren't being collected. They're being generated."

Cotter stared at the graph. He had suspected something like this for
months -- the numbers were too clean, too consistent, too perfectly
aligned with what the command wanted to hear. But suspecting and
seeing were different things. A suspicion was a feeling. A graph was
evidence.

"Generated by whom?"

"That's what I can't figure out. It's not coming from the field units.
I checked with three battalion S-2 shops in Quang Tri. Their raw
contact reports show flat or declining enemy activity. The inflation
is happening somewhere between the battalion level and the province
reporting level."

"The district advisory teams?"

"Possibly. But the pattern is too consistent for individual human
fraud. If district advisors were padding their numbers independently,
you'd see variation -- some would pad more, some less, some would
miss a reporting period. This is -- " She tapped the graph. "This
is systematic. It's a formula."

Cotter sat back in his chair and listened to the air conditioning
unit rattle like a sick dog. He thought about the numbers on Major
Davis's slides. He thought about the numbers flowing to MACV, to the
Pentagon, to the White House. He thought about the newspaper stories
he read in the Stars and Stripes, the ones that said progress was
being made, that the enemy was being ground down, that the crossover
point -- the magic moment when enemy losses would exceed enemy
replacements -- was approaching.

"If you're right," he said, "then every attrition estimate going
to Washington is wrong."

"Not wrong, sir. That implies error. These numbers are right. They're
exactly right. They're exactly what someone decided they should be."

"Which means the crossover point --"

"Is a fiction. We're not approaching it. We never were. It's a
number on a graph that was drawn to show a line going where someone
wanted it to go."

Cotter picked up his pen and wrote in his notebook: Engel confirms.
Numbers generated, not collected. Systematic. Formula-based. All
attrition estimates compromised.

He underlined the last word three times.


                              III.

He should have gone through channels. He knew that. Twenty-three
years in the Army had taught him that the chain of command existed
for a reason, that channels were not bureaucratic inconvenience but
the circulatory system of the institution, and that a man who
bypassed channels was a man who had decided he was smarter than the
system. Cotter did not think he was smarter than the system. He
thought the system was lying, which was different.

He went to see Colonel Marvin Greer, his immediate superior and the
chief of the Analysis Directorate. Greer was a tall, thin man with
a patrician bearing and an unfortunate resemblance to a heron --
all neck and patience, with the ability to stand perfectly still for
long periods before striking at something small. He had been in
intelligence for twenty years, which meant he had been in the
business of information for twenty years, which meant he understood
that information was not the same thing as truth.

Cotter laid Engel's graphs on Greer's desk and explained what they
showed. He was precise. He was methodical. He presented the evidence
the way he had been trained to present evidence: data first,
analysis second, conclusions last.

Greer looked at the graphs for a long time. He did not touch them.
He looked at them the way a man looks at a snake he has found in
his boot -- not with surprise, exactly, but with the unhappy
recognition that a thing he had hoped to avoid was now unavoidably
present.

"Nathan," he said. He only used Cotter's first name when the
conversation was about to leave the realm of official business and
enter the realm of career advice. "How long have you been in the
Army?"

"Twenty-three years, sir."

"And in those twenty-three years, have you ever known a headquarters
that didn't shade the numbers?"

"There's a difference between shading and fabricating, sir."

"Is there?" Greer picked up one of the graphs, held it at arm's
length, and then set it down again. "You're telling me that someone,
somewhere in the reporting chain, is generating attrition figures
according to a formula. I believe you. Your methodology is sound,
your analyst is first-rate, and the evidence is persuasive. So let
me tell you what I know, which is not a matter of evidence but of
experience."

He leaned back in his chair.

"Every war produces the numbers it needs. In World War II, we needed
production numbers, and by God we got them -- factories running
three shifts, liberty ships sliding down the ways every seventy-two
hours. Some of those numbers were real and some were aspirational,
but they served the purpose. In Korea, we needed body counts to
justify the stalemate, and we got those too. The methodology was --
let us say -- flexible."

"Sir, those were isolated instances of --"

"They were not isolated. They were systemic. And this is systemic.
The difference is one of scale, not of kind." Greer folded his
hands on the desk. "Nathan, the commanding general needs attrition
numbers that show progress toward the crossover point. The
ambassador needs pacification numbers that show the political
program is working. The Secretary of Defense needs cost-effectiveness
ratios that justify the expenditure. The President needs all of these
things to tell the American people that the war is being won. And
every man in that chain, from the district advisor in Quang Tri to
the briefer in the White House Situation Room, understands what
numbers are needed and produces them."

"You're describing a conspiracy."

"I'm describing an institution. A conspiracy requires people meeting
in secret and agreeing to deceive. This requires nothing of the kind.
It requires only that every man in the chain understand what is
expected and deliver it. No one orders the fraud. No one has to. The
pressure is atmospheric. It is in the air they breathe."

Cotter felt something cold settle in his chest. Not surprise -- he
had suspected all of this -- but the particular chill of having a
suspicion confirmed by someone who had no intention of doing anything
about it.

"So what do I do with this?" He pointed at the graphs.

Greer was quiet for a moment. When he spoke, his voice had the
careful, measured quality of a man choosing each word the way a
surgeon chooses instruments.

"You have three options, Nathan. Option one: you file a formal report
through channels. The report will be received, acknowledged, and
filed. It will change nothing. The numbers will continue as before,
and you will be noted as a man who does not understand the larger
picture. Your next efficiency report will reflect this. Option two:
you go over my head, directly to the commanding general or to the
Inspector General. Your report will be received, investigated by men
who have a professional interest in finding nothing, and dismissed.
You will be reassigned to a position of no consequence, probably
stateside, probably at a desk where you will count something that
doesn't matter. Your career will be over. Option three --" He
paused. "You close your notebook. You do your job. You accept that
the numbers are what they are and that your role is to verify the
methodology, not to challenge the conclusions."

"And which option do you recommend, sir?"

"I recommend option three. Not because it is right, but because it
is survivable."

Cotter looked at the photograph of Louise on Greer's desk -- Greer
had one too, of his own wife, Eleanor, a sharp-featured woman who
played bridge and voted Republican and had no idea what her husband
did all day. He thought about the two years and four months remaining
until his retirement. He thought about the house in San Antonio and
the pension and the quiet life Louise had been promised.

Then he thought about Engel's graph. The four lines rising in perfect
parallel. The fictional dead, marching upward in neat columns toward
a crossover point that did not exist.

"I'll think about it, sir."

"Think quickly, Nathan. Thinking is a luxury in this theater."


                              IV.

He did not choose option three.

He did not, in fairness, choose option one or option two either. He
chose option four, which Greer had not mentioned because Greer, for
all his intelligence, thought like an insider, and option four was an
outsider's move.

Cotter went looking for the formula.

He told Engel what he intended, partly because he needed her help and
partly because he believed she had the right to know. They were in
his office, late evening, the fluorescent lights buzzing and the heat
pressing down like a hand.

"I want to find the actual mechanism," he said. "You showed me the
pattern. Now I want to know how it works. Where does the fabrication
enter the system? Who designed it? Is it a deliberate algorithm or
an emergent behavior?"

Engel looked at him with the expression she wore when she was doing
mental arithmetic, which was most of the time.

"You understand that finding the mechanism won't change anything the
Colonel said. Even if we can prove exactly how the numbers are being
generated, the institution will --"

"I know. I want to find it anyway."

"Why?"

It was a fair question, and Cotter gave it the respect of honest
thought before answering.

"Because I'm a mathematician. When I see a pattern, I need to
understand the function that generates it. Call it professional
compulsion."

Engel smiled -- a rare event, like a solar eclipse. "That I
understand, sir. Where do we start?"

"The district advisory teams. That's where the field data enters the
system. I want to visit three of them -- one in each corps tactical
zone -- and watch the reporting process from the ground up."

They started in II Corps, at a district advisory compound in Binh
Dinh Province that smelled of diesel fuel and burning garbage. The
compound was a cluster of sandbagged buildings surrounded by
concertina wire, staffed by a handful of Army officers and NCOs
whose job was to advise the South Vietnamese district chief on
security, governance, and development, and whose actual job was to
produce numbers.

The district senior advisor was a captain named Fordham, a
twenty-five-year-old from Ohio with the sunburned face and hollow
eyes of a man who had been in-country too long. He received Cotter
and Engel with the wary hospitality of a man visited by inspectors.

"I'll show you whatever you want to see, sir," Fordham said. "But
I should tell you up front that our numbers are solid. We follow the
reporting methodology to the letter."

"That's what I'm here to look at," Cotter said. "The methodology."

Fordham took them to the reporting room -- a plywood-walled space
with a desk, a filing cabinet, and a wall covered in maps and
charts. On the desk was a thick three-ring binder labeled PROVINCE
REPORTING HANDBOOK, REVISED EDITION, OCTOBER 1967.

"This is the bible," Fordham said, tapping the binder. "Every number
we report, the methodology for collecting it, the formulas for
aggregating it, the schedules for submitting it. We follow the
handbook."

Cotter opened the binder. He had seen earlier versions -- he had,
in fact, helped write the original version in 1965 -- but this
revised edition was new to him. He began reading.

It took him twenty minutes to find it. Not because it was hidden,
but because it was so elegantly embedded in the methodology that
you could read right past it without noticing, the way you could
read past a typographical error in a familiar text.

The handbook contained a section titled "Estimation Methodology for
Unverified Enemy Casualties." It was three pages long, written in
the dry, precise language of statistical procedure, and it described
a method for estimating enemy dead who could not be physically
counted because the bodies were in inaccessible areas, had been
removed by the enemy, or had been destroyed by ordnance.

The method was straightforward: you took the number of confirmed
enemy dead (bodies actually seen and counted), applied a multiplier
based on the type of engagement, the terrain, and the ordnance
used, and added the result to the confirmed count as "probable KIA."

The multipliers were listed in a table on page forty-seven. For a
company-level engagement in jungle terrain with artillery support,
the multiplier was 2.4. For a battalion-level engagement in open
terrain with air support, it was 3.1. For a "significant contact"
in any terrain with combined arms, it was 4.7.

Cotter stared at the table. He felt the cold thing in his chest
again, colder now.

"Captain Fordham. Where did these multipliers come from?"

"The handbook, sir."

"I mean, what's the empirical basis? What data were they derived
from?"

Fordham looked confused -- genuinely confused, not evasively
confused. "I don't know, sir. They're in the handbook. We apply
them."

"Have you ever questioned them?"

"No, sir. They're the approved methodology. We follow the
methodology."

Cotter turned to Engel. She was already doing the math in her head,
her lips moving slightly.

"A multiplier of 4.7 on 'significant contacts,'" she said quietly.
"Meaning for every confirmed body, we're reporting almost five
additional probable kills. And the definition of 'significant
contact' is broad enough to cover virtually any engagement above
squad level."

"Which means the estimation methodology automatically inflates the
raw numbers by a factor of --"

"Between three and six, depending on the engagement type and the
choices made by the reporting officer."

"And the reporting officer has discretion in choosing which
multiplier to apply?"

Fordham nodded. "Within the guidelines, sir. The handbook says to
use professional judgment in selecting the appropriate category."

Professional judgment. Cotter wrote the phrase in his notebook and
looked at it. Professional judgment, exercised by young captains
who knew that their commanders wanted higher numbers, applied to
multipliers that had no empirical basis, producing estimates that
were reported as data and briefed as fact.

It was not a conspiracy. Greer had been right about that. It was a
machine. Someone had designed it -- someone had sat down and written
those multipliers, chosen those categories, structured the
methodology so that inflation was built into the process like a ratchet
that only turned one way -- but once the machine was built, it ran
itself. No one had to order the fraud. The handbook ordered it, in
the calm, procedural language of institutional authority.

"Thank you, Captain," Cotter said. "Your numbers are solid. You
follow the methodology to the letter. That is exactly the problem."


                               V.

They visited two more advisory compounds. The pattern was identical.
Young officers following the handbook. Multipliers applied with
professional judgment. Numbers rising like water in a lock, each
level lifting the next.

On the helicopter back to Saigon, Engel sat with her field notebook
open, working equations with a pencil while the rotor noise made
conversation impossible. Cotter watched the landscape below -- rice
paddies, tree lines, villages, the occasional plume of smoke that
could be cooking fire or something worse -- and thought about
multipliers.

The genius of the system, he realized, was that it was honest at
every level. Fordham was honest. He followed the handbook. The
handbook was honest. It described a methodology. The methodology
was honest. It used professional judgment and approved multipliers.
The multipliers were -- well, the multipliers were the lie, but they
were presented as technical parameters, and who questioned technical
parameters? They were numbers in a table, and numbers in tables had
the authority of mathematics, which was the most honest language
human beings had ever devised.

Except when it wasn't. Except when someone used the authority of
mathematics to launder a lie.

Back in Saigon, Cotter wrote his report. Not through channels --
Greer had made clear what channels would accomplish -- but as a
document, a record, a proof in the mathematical sense: a chain of
reasoning leading from axioms to an inescapable conclusion.

He titled it: "Analysis of Estimation Methodology in the Hamlet
Evaluation System and Province Reporting Framework: A Statistical
Assessment." Thirty-seven pages, with appendices containing Engel's
graphs, the multiplier tables from the handbook, the comparison
with raw field data, and a regression analysis demonstrating that
the reported attrition figures could not have been derived from
actual combat operations.

His conclusion was four sentences long:

"The attrition figures currently being reported through the province
advisory system are the product of an estimation methodology that
systematically inflates raw data by a factor of 3.2 to 5.8. This
inflation is not the result of individual error or deliberate fraud
at the field level but of multipliers embedded in the approved
reporting methodology that have no demonstrated empirical basis.
The net effect is that all attrition estimates currently being
provided to senior military and civilian leadership overstate enemy
casualties by approximately 300 to 500 percent. The crossover point,
as currently projected, is a mathematical artifact of the
methodology and does not reflect actual battlefield conditions."

He showed the report to Engel before he submitted it.

"It's accurate," she said. "It's also a career-ending document."

"I know."

"Are you sure?"

"Captain, are the numbers real?"

She looked at him with those clear, relentless mathematician's eyes.
"No, sir. They are not."

"Then the report is necessary."

He filed it through the Inspector General's office on a Thursday
morning, hand-delivering the original and keeping two copies, one
in his office safe and one in a sealed envelope that he mailed to
Louise in San Antonio with a note that said: Keep this somewhere
safe. Don't open it unless I ask you to.


                              VI.

For two weeks, nothing happened. Cotter continued attending the
morning briefings, continued writing numbers in his notebook,
continued watching the fictional dead march upward in neat columns
on Major Davis's slides. The war continued. The numbers continued.

Then, on a Tuesday afternoon, he was summoned to General Wheaton's
office.

Wheaton's office was air-conditioned to the temperature of a meat
locker, which Cotter had always suspected was a deliberate
psychological tactic -- visitors shivered, and shivering men were
at a disadvantage. The general sat behind a desk the size of a
landing craft, flanked by his chief of staff and a lieutenant
colonel from the Judge Advocate General's office whose presence Cotter
noted with the calm precision of a man noting the position of enemy
forces on a map.

"Sit down, Colonel."

Cotter sat. He did not shiver, but this required effort.

"I have read your report," Wheaton said. He said it the way a man
says I have found a rat in my kitchen -- not surprised, but offended
by the inconvenience. "I have also had it reviewed by the
methodology section at MACV headquarters. Their assessment is that
your analysis is technically competent but fundamentally flawed in
its assumptions."

"In what way, sir?"

"You assume that the estimation multipliers should be derived from
empirical data. The methodology section points out that the
multipliers are policy tools, not empirical measurements. They
reflect command judgment about the relationship between confirmed
kills and actual enemy losses, taking into account factors that
cannot be directly observed."

Cotter felt something shift inside him -- a gear engaging, a
mechanism clicking into place. He had heard this argument before,
in different language, in different contexts. It was the argument
that allowed the number to mean whatever the institution needed it
to mean.

"Sir, with respect, if the multipliers are not derived from data,
then the estimates they produce are not estimates. They're targets.
The system isn't measuring enemy attrition. It's generating a
predetermined narrative of progress."

The JAG lieutenant colonel shifted in his chair. Wheaton's chief
of staff wrote something on a notepad.

Wheaton leaned forward. His voice was quiet now, which was worse
than shouting. Generals who shouted were expressing emotion.
Generals who went quiet were making decisions.

"Colonel Cotter, let me be direct. The commanding general is aware
of your report. He is not pleased. He considers it an indication
that the Statistical Verification Section has lost sight of its
mission, which is to verify methodology, not to second-guess
command judgment."

"The mission of the Statistical Verification Section is to ensure
the accuracy of --"

"The mission of the Statistical Verification Section is what the
commanding general says it is. And the commanding general says that
its mission is to verify that reporting units are following the
approved methodology. Not to question the methodology itself. Is
that clear?"

"Yes, sir."

"Good. I am directing that your report be withdrawn from the IG
office and classified. Captain Engel is being reassigned to MACV
headquarters, effective immediately, where her analytical skills
can be better utilized. The Statistical Verification Section will
confine itself to its defined mission going forward."

Cotter sat very still. He thought about Louise. He thought about
the house in San Antonio. He thought about the two years and three
months remaining until his pension.

Then he thought about the multipliers. The fictional dead. The
crossover point that existed only on a graph that someone had drawn
to show a line going where someone wanted it to go. And beyond the
graph, the real dead -- American and Vietnamese, the ones who didn't
appear on any slide, whose numbers no one multiplied because their
bodies were real and did not require estimation.

"Sir, I have a question."

Wheaton waited.

"The methodology section reviewed my report and found it technically
competent. Does that mean they agree that the multipliers have no
empirical basis?"

"It means they found your analysis technically competent. What it
does not mean --"

"Because if the multipliers have no empirical basis, then the
attrition estimates have no empirical basis, and every assessment
of progress toward the crossover point is based on numbers that were
manufactured to show progress toward the crossover point. Which means
we don't know if we're winning. We don't know if we're losing. We
don't know anything at all, because the instrument we built to
measure the war is actually a machine for telling us what we want
to hear."

The room was very cold and very quiet.

"Is that insubordination, Colonel?"

"No, sir. It's arithmetic."

Wheaton looked at the JAG officer. The JAG officer looked at his
notepad.

"You are relieved of command of the Statistical Verification Section,
effective immediately. You are being reassigned to CONUS, Fort
Huachuca, where you will serve as deputy chief of the Training
Analysis Division pending a review of your performance in this
theater. You are dismissed."

Cotter stood up. He picked up his notebook from the arm of the
chair -- the notebook filled with six months of numbers, questions,
observations, the careful record of a mathematician watching an
institution lie to itself.

"Sir."

"What is it, Colonel?"

"The numbers will still be wrong after I leave."

"Dismissed, Colonel."

Cotter walked out of the air-conditioned office into the Saigon
heat, which hit him like a wall of wet cloth, and stood in the
sun for a moment, letting the warmth soak into his bones. A jeep
rattled past. A helicopter crossed overhead. Somewhere, a radio
was playing "The Letter" by the Box Tops, and the lyrics drifted
through the humid air: Gimme a ticket for an aeroplane.

He opened his notebook to a fresh page and wrote: Relieved. Numbers
still wrong. Nobody cares.

Then, below that: That's not true. I care. Engel cares.

And below that: Not enough.


                              VII.

Fort Huachuca was in the desert south of Tucson, a landscape so
different from Vietnam that Cotter felt, in his first weeks there,
as though he had been transferred not just to another post but to
another planet. The heat was dry instead of wet, the sky was
enormous instead of close, and the silence -- the desert silence,
vast and clean and indifferent -- was so different from the constant
noise of Saigon that it hurt his ears.

The Training Analysis Division was exactly what it sounded like: a
unit that analyzed training programs. How many rounds did recruits
fire to achieve qualification? What was the attrition rate in basic
training? How did different training methodologies affect skill
retention? It was useful work, in its way. It was also, unmistakably,
exile.

Louise drove up from San Antonio on his first weekend. She was a
small, steady woman with gray-streaked brown hair and the particular
kind of patience that comes from being married to the Army for
twenty-three years. She looked at the quarters -- a modest house on
a quiet street, with a view of the Huachuca Mountains -- and said,
"It's nice, Nathan. We can be happy here."

"I was fired, Louise."

"You were reassigned."

"I was fired for telling the truth."

She sat down on the couch -- the government-issue couch, in the
government-issue living room -- and looked at him with an expression
he recognized from twenty-three years of marriage: the expression
that meant she was about to say something he needed to hear and
didn't want to.

"Nathan. Were the numbers wrong?"

"Yes."

"Did you prove they were wrong?"

"Yes."

"Did anyone listen?"

"No."

"Then you did your job. The fact that no one listened is their
failure, not yours."

"People are making decisions based on those numbers, Louise. Real
decisions. How many troops to send. Where to send them. How long
to keep fighting. And the numbers are wrong. The foundation is
wrong. Everything built on it is wrong."

"I know. And you can't fix it from Saigon and you can't fix it from
Fort Huachuca and you can't fix it from this couch. So the question
is what you can do."

He didn't have an answer for that. Not yet.

He unpacked his footlocker. At the bottom, under his dress uniforms
and his spare boots, was the notebook. He put it in the desk drawer
in the small room Louise had already designated as his office, next
to the sealed envelope containing the second copy of his report,
which Louise had kept, as instructed, without opening.

He went to work at the Training Analysis Division. He counted rounds
fired and attrition rates and skill retention curves. He was good at
it, because he was good at counting things, because he had always been
good at counting things, because the beauty of mathematics was that it
did not lie unless you made it lie.

In the evenings, he sat in his office and wrote.

Not reports. Not analyses. He was done with those. He wrote something
else -- something that started as notes and became, gradually, a
narrative. The story of a war told entirely in numbers. The real
numbers and the fictional numbers, side by side, and the space
between them, which was not a statistical margin of error but a moral
chasm into which people were falling.

He wrote about Fordham, the young captain in Binh Dinh who followed
the handbook because the handbook was the authority and authority was
what you followed. He wrote about Davis, the briefer who delivered
fictional numbers with the smooth confidence of a man who believed
them, or had stopped caring whether he believed them, which amounted
to the same thing. He wrote about Greer, who understood everything
and chose to survive rather than to object. He wrote about Wheaton,
who defended the numbers not because he believed they were true but
because they were useful, and in a war, usefulness was a higher
value than truth.

And he wrote about Engel, who had been reassigned to MACV
headquarters, where her analytical skills could be better utilized,
which meant where she could be watched, which meant where her
dangerous clarity could be diluted by proximity to the machine she
had exposed.

He wrote about himself. A mathematician who had spent his career
believing that numbers were the most honest language human beings
possessed, and who had discovered that the institution he served had
found a way to make numbers lie without anyone having to tell them
to.

He wrote for three months. When he was done, he had a manuscript of
forty-seven pages. He did not know what it was. It was not a report;
it was not a story; it was not a confession. It was, he decided, a
proof -- not in the mathematical sense but in the older sense, the
sense of testing: a trial by ordeal, conducted on paper, to determine
whether the truth could survive its passage through an institution
designed to reshape it.


                             VIII.

Captain Engel wrote to him once, a letter postmarked from Saigon,
dated three weeks after his departure. It was brief and carefully
worded -- she knew that her mail might be read -- but its meaning
was clear.

Dear Colonel Cotter,

I hope you are well at Fort Huachuca. I am settling into my
new position at MACV headquarters, where I am assigned to the
Systems Analysis Division. My work consists primarily of
compiling data for the weekly progress reports.

I wanted to let you know that the province reporting handbook
was revised again in January. The estimation multipliers have
been updated. The new multiplier for significant contacts in
all terrain types is 6.3.

I thought you would want to know.

Respectfully,
Captain Sarah Engel

Cotter read the letter twice. The multiplier had gone from 4.7 to
6.3. The machine had not been corrected. It had been accelerated.

He sat at his desk for a long time, holding the letter. Outside,
the desert wind was blowing, pushing dust against the windows in
soft, persistent waves. He could hear Louise in the kitchen, running
water, the domestic sounds of a life that continued regardless of
what he knew or didn't know.

He picked up his pen and added a postscript to his manuscript:

The multipliers have been increased. The fictional dead now
outnumber the real dead by a factor of six to one. By the time
this reaches the briefing slides, the ratio will be higher. By
the time it reaches the White House, higher still. And by the
time the President looks into a camera and tells the American
people that we are winning, the number will be so far from
reality that it will inhabit a different universe entirely --
a universe where the war is being won, where the enemy is being
destroyed, where the crossover point is approaching, where the
light at the end of the tunnel is not an oncoming train.

In that universe, the numbers add up. In that universe,
everything makes sense. It is a beautiful universe, logically
consistent, internally coherent, and completely fictional.

We do not live in that universe. We live in this one, where the
numbers are wrong and the war goes on and the real dead do not
appear on any slide.

He put down his pen. He filed the manuscript in his desk drawer,
beside the notebook and the sealed envelope.

He went to the kitchen. Louise was making dinner -- pot roast, his
favorite, the kind of meal she made when she could see he was
suffering and wanted to offer comfort in the only language the Army
had ever let her speak.

"Smells good," he said.

"Sit down. Eat."

He sat down. He ate. The pot roast was excellent. The desert wind
blew. The war continued. The numbers continued. The multipliers
multiplied.

And somewhere in Saigon, in an air-conditioned briefing room that
smelled of burnt coffee and lies, a major was standing before a
screen, pointing to a graph where a line climbed steadily upward
toward a crossover point that did not exist, and saying, with the
absolute confidence of a man who believed the methodology:

"Gentlemen, the numbers speak for themselves."

They did. They always do. The question is what language they're
speaking, and whether anyone is left who remembers how to translate.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         ECOLOGY OF FEAR

                      by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                               I.

The first thing Dr. Yael Oren noticed about Kepler-442b was that
everything was afraid.

Not metaphorically. Not in the anthropomorphic sense that a deer is
"afraid" when it startles at a sound -- a projection of human emotion
onto a stimulus-response mechanism. The organisms of Kepler-442b
exhibited fear the way terrestrial organisms exhibited metabolism:
as a fundamental biological process, continuous and systemic, woven
into every level of organization from the cellular to the ecological.

She noticed it on the third day, standing at the edge of a meadow --
she used the word reluctantly; the ground cover was a dense mat of
photosynthetic filaments, not grass, and the resemblance was
superficial -- watching the behavior of the organisms the survey
team had designated "grazers." They were flat, disc-shaped creatures,
roughly the size of dinner plates, that moved across the filament
mat in slow, overlapping paths, their ventral surfaces absorbing
nutrients through direct contact. They should have been placid.
Their ecological niche was the equivalent of a terrestrial
herbivore -- primary consumers, positioned at the base of the food
web, performing the essential work of converting photosynthetic
biomass into animal tissue.

They were not placid. They moved in constant, jittering adjustments,
never maintaining a straight line for more than a few seconds,
changing direction at irregular intervals, their flat bodies
rippling with what the biophysics team had identified as muscular
contractions consistent with a sustained stress response. Their
chemical profiles, sampled by the field sensors, showed continuous
elevated levels of cortisol-analogues and adrenaline-equivalents --
not the spikes associated with acute fear, the fight-or-flight
response of a prey animal detecting a predator, but a sustained,
chronic elevation. A baseline of terror.

"They're afraid," Yael said to Marcus Ferrara, the team's
ecologist, who was crouched beside her with a specimen jar and a
pair of forceps, collecting filament samples.

"Of what?" Marcus didn't look up. He was focused on a section of
the filament mat that had changed color overnight, shifting from
the deep blue-green that indicated active photosynthesis to a pale,
almost white shade that might indicate disease, dormancy, or
something they hadn't categorized yet.

"That's the question. There are no predators in visual range. No
aerial threats -- the atmospheric fauna survey hasn't found anything
that preys on organisms this size. The chemical environment is
stable. There's no immediate stimulus. They're just -- afraid."

Marcus sat back on his heels and looked at the grazers. He watched
them for a long time, the way he watched everything -- with the
patient, absorbing attention of a man who had spent his career
learning to see what ecosystems were doing rather than what he
expected them to do.

"All of them?" he asked.

Yael swept her sensor across the meadow. Sixteen grazers in the
sampling area, all exhibiting the same chemical profile, the same
jittering movement pattern, the same continuous stress response.

"All of them."

"What about the filaments?"

It was the right question. Yael recalibrated her sensor and directed
it at the ground cover. The readings took a moment to process --
the filaments' biochemistry was different enough from terrestrial
plant chemistry that the sensor's algorithms had to work harder --
and when they came through, Yael felt a sensation she recognized
as the beginning of understanding, which was indistinguishable, in
its physical manifestation, from the beginning of dread.

The filaments were producing fear compounds.

Not the grazers' fear compounds -- the filaments had their own
stress chemistry, their own suite of molecular signals, distinct
from the grazers' but functionally equivalent. The photosynthetic
filaments that carpeted the surface of Kepler-442b, the base of the
planetary food web, the foundation on which every other organism
depended, were in a state of continuous biochemical terror.

"Marcus."

He looked at her sensor readings. His face did something complicated.

"The plants are afraid too," he said.

"They're not plants. But yes."

They looked at the meadow. The blue-green filaments rippled in a
wind that was not blowing. The grazers jittered across the surface.
Above them, in the amber sky, a flock of the small aerial organisms
the team called "kites" wheeled in tight, erratic circles, never
settling, never gliding, their flight paths the airborne equivalent
of the grazers' ground-level panic.

Everything was afraid. Everything was always afraid.


                              II.

Dr. Lena Sorensen ran the research station with the brisk efficiency
of a woman who had managed field operations on four worlds and
maintained her sanity on all of them, which was a better record than
most. She was fifty-three, lean and weathered, with short gray hair
and the permanently squinted eyes of someone who had spent too many
years looking at alien suns. She held the daily briefing in the
station's common room, a prefabricated dome that smelled of coffee
and the faint, sweet-sour scent of Kepler-442b's atmosphere leaking
through the seal joins.

"Ecological survey, day forty-seven," Sorensen said, reading from
her tablet. "I have reports from all four teams, and I want to note
a pattern that's emerging across disciplines. Yael?"

Yael stood and presented her findings. The fear response was not
limited to the meadow ecosystem. In the forty-seven days since the
survey team had established the research station, every organism
they had studied -- across seven distinct biomes, from the deep
thermal vents to the high-altitude crystalline plains -- exhibited
the same sustained fear chemistry.

The predators were afraid. The prey were afraid. The decomposers
were afraid. The photosynthetic base was afraid. Organisms that had
no natural enemies were afraid. Organisms at the top of the food
chain were afraid. Sessile organisms that could not flee were afraid.
Microscopic organisms too small to be preyed upon by anything larger
than a virus were afraid.

"It's universal," Yael said. "I've now sampled over two hundred
species across all major biomes. Every one shows a sustained fear
response. Not episodic, not stimulus-driven -- continuous. It's
their default state."

The room was quiet. Yael could hear the environmental systems
humming, the faint ping of the atmospheric sensors, the distant
hiss of wind against the dome.

Dr. Kenji Yamamoto, the team's evolutionary biologist, raised his
hand. He was a quiet man, methodical, who thought in geological
time and spoke in carefully constructed sentences.

"Is it maladaptive?"

"Define maladaptive," Yael said.

"On Earth, chronic stress is pathological. Sustained cortisol
elevation damages tissues, suppresses immune function, shortens
lifespan. If every organism on this planet is in a state of
continuous fear, we should be seeing systemic health consequences.
Organ damage. Shortened lifespans. Reproductive failure. Are we?"

"No." This was what troubled Yael most. "The organisms show no
negative health effects from the sustained stress chemistry. Their
tissues are adapted to it. Their immune systems function normally
in the presence of elevated stress hormones. Their lifespans are
comparable to what we'd predict from their metabolic rates. The
fear isn't hurting them. It's --" She paused, looking for the right
word. "It's baseline. It's their normal."

"Then it's not maladaptive," Kenji said. "It's been selected for.
Which means it serves a function."

"What function?" Marcus asked from his corner of the room. He had
been uncharacteristically quiet during the briefing, sitting with
his arms folded and his eyes half-closed in the posture that Yael
had learned to recognize as deep thought.

"That's what we need to determine," Sorensen said. "And that brings
me to the second item on the agenda. We've received authorization
from the Colonial Biology Division to conduct an intervention
experiment."

The room shifted. Intervention experiments were controversial -- the
deliberate manipulation of an alien ecosystem to test hypotheses
about its function. They were also, as every field biologist knew,
the only way to understand a system whose rules you hadn't figured
out from observation alone.

"What kind of intervention?" Yael asked, though she already knew.

"Chemical suppression of the fear response in a contained area.
Dr. Yamamoto's team has synthesized a compound that inhibits the
primary fear-signaling pathways in the organisms we've studied. We
will apply it to a one-hectare test plot and observe the effects."

"You want to turn off the fear," Marcus said.

"In a controlled area, yes. If fear is the dominant behavioral and
biochemical feature of this ecology, then removing it should tell
us what it does. If the ecology functions normally without fear,
then the fear is epiphenomenal -- a byproduct of some other
process, not a driver. If the ecology changes, then fear is
functional, and we can begin to understand its role."

Marcus unfolded his arms. "And if the ecology collapses?"

Sorensen looked at him. "That would also be informative."

"It would also be destructive."

"It's one hectare, Marcus. On a planet with one hundred forty
million square kilometers of surface area. The ecological impact
will be negligible."

"The ecological impact of a one-hectare disruption is always
negligible. That's how we justify every disruption. And then we
scale up."

Sorensen's jaw tightened. This was an old argument between them, and
it had the quality of a wound that had been treated but not healed.

"The experiment has been authorized, Marcus. I'm informing you, not
asking your permission."

Marcus nodded. He did not argue further. Yael knew him well enough
to know that his silence was not agreement but withdrawal -- the
ecologist's version of a predator retreating to reassess its
approach.


                             III.

They set up the test plot on the meadow where Yael had made her
initial observation. It was a practical choice -- they had the most
complete baseline data for this biome -- and an aesthetic one. The
meadow was beautiful, in its unsettling way: the blue-green filaments
rippling like water, the disc-shaped grazers drifting across the
surface, the kites wheeling overhead. A landscape of constant motion,
constant agitation, constant fear, that was nevertheless, in its
totality, a functioning and apparently healthy ecosystem.

Kenji's team had spent three weeks synthesizing the suppression
compound -- a cocktail of enzyme inhibitors targeted at the
fear-signaling pathways they had identified in the six most
prevalent species in the meadow biome. It was not a sedative; it
would not make the organisms drowsy or unresponsive. It would
specifically and selectively suppress the biochemical cascade that
produced the fear response, leaving all other physiological
functions intact.

"Think of it as an anxiolytic," Kenji said during the pre-experiment
briefing. "Targeted, specific, reversible. We're not shutting down
their nervous systems. We're turning off the alarm."

"What alarm?" Marcus said from the back of the room.

"The fear response."

"I know. What is the alarm responding to?"

Kenji paused. "We don't know. That's what the experiment is designed
to determine."

"So we're turning off an alarm without knowing what it's warning
them about."

"That is one way to characterize it, yes."

"That's the only way to characterize it."

Sorensen intervened. "Marcus, your objection is noted. Shall we
proceed?"

They proceeded.

The compound was dispersed by aerial drone over the one-hectare test
plot at dawn, settling over the filament mat as a fine mist that
caught the amber light of Kepler-442b's sun and briefly turned the
meadow gold. Yael watched from the observation platform at the edge
of the plot, her sensor array calibrated to the fear-chemistry
signatures of every organism in the sampling area.

The effect was not immediate. The compound needed time to penetrate
the organisms' tissues, to reach the receptor sites, to interrupt
the signaling cascades. Yael tracked the chemistry in real time,
watching the stress-hormone levels on her display like a doctor
watching a patient's vitals.

At thirty-seven minutes post-dispersal, the filaments' fear chemistry
began to drop. The blue-green ground cover, which had been producing
fear compounds at a steady rate for every moment of the forty-seven
days they had been observing it, showed a declining curve that
steepened as the compound took full effect. By sixty minutes, the
filaments' fear response was suppressed to near zero.

The grazers followed. Their cortisol-analogues plummeted. Their
jittering movements slowed, then stopped. For the first time since
the survey team had arrived on Kepler-442b, the disc-shaped
creatures moved in smooth, steady lines across the filament mat,
grazing without agitation, without the constant directional changes,
without the muscular contractions of sustained stress.

The kites descended. Their erratic, wheeling flight patterns
smoothed into long, gentle glides. They settled on the filament mat
-- something Yael had never seen them do -- and folded their
membranous wings, resting.

"Stress chemistry across all sampled species approaching zero,"
Yael reported. "The fear response is effectively suppressed."

Sorensen, standing beside her on the observation platform, looked
at the meadow. In the amber light, with the filaments still and
the grazers moving smoothly and the kites at rest, it looked --
peaceful. Pastoral. A landscape that could have appeared on a
recruitment poster for colonial settlement.

"It's beautiful," Sorensen said.

It was. Yael felt the truth of it in her body -- a relaxation, a
release of tension she hadn't known she was carrying, as though the
organisms' fear had been transmitted to her through some channel
she couldn't name. With the fear removed, the meadow was
tranquil, and standing at its edge, Yael felt tranquil too.

Marcus, standing ten meters away at his own monitoring station, said
nothing.


                              IV.

The first change came at hour six.

The filaments stopped photosynthesizing. Not all at once -- the
cessation moved across the test plot in a wave, beginning at the
center where the compound concentration was highest and spreading
outward like a stain. The blue-green color faded to the pale
white Yael had observed in isolated patches before -- the color
she had tentatively categorized as dormancy.

It was not dormancy.

"The filaments are shutting down metabolic processes," Yael
reported, watching her sensor data with the focused attention of a
doctor watching a patient crash. "Photosynthesis first, now active
transport across cell membranes. They're not going dormant. They're
-- they're stopping."

"Stopping what?" Sorensen asked.

"Everything. Every active metabolic process. It's as though they've
lost the signal to continue functioning."

At hour nine, the grazers stopped moving. Not gradually, the way
they had slowed when the fear was first suppressed -- suddenly,
all at once, as though someone had turned off a switch. Sixteen
grazers in the test plot, all motionless, their flat bodies lying
on the pale, inert filament mat like coins scattered on a white
tablecloth.

Yael checked their vitals. They were alive. Their cellular processes
were still running, their biochemistry still active. But they had
stopped all voluntary movement, all feeding, all behavioral activity.
They simply lay there, inert.

"The kites," Marcus said. It was the first thing he had said in
hours.

Yael looked up. The kites that had settled on the filament mat were
motionless too. And above the test plot, where kites from the
surrounding area normally wheeled in their characteristic fearful
patterns, the sky was empty. They had flown away. Not in panic --
they had simply left, moving outward from the test plot in expanding
circles, as though avoiding a contaminated zone.

"They can sense it," Marcus said. "From outside the treatment area.
They know something is wrong."

"What's wrong?" Sorensen asked. "We removed the fear. We didn't
introduce a toxin, didn't disrupt their food supply, didn't change
the physical environment. All we did was suppress the fear
response."

"And everything stopped," Marcus said.

At hour fourteen, the first grazer died.

Its cellular processes wound down over the course of forty minutes,
not catastrophically, not with the explosive molecular failures of
acute poisoning, but slowly, methodically, as though the organism
were shutting itself down according to a protocol. First peripheral
systems, then secondary organs, then primary organs, then the
central nervous analogue. An orderly cessation. A controlled
shutdown.

Yael documented it with the precision her training demanded and the
horror her humanity could not suppress. The grazer did not die of
fear; it died of the absence of fear. Without the sustained
biochemical terror that had been its default state, it had no
signal to keep living.

By hour twenty, all sixteen grazers were dead. The filament mat was
white and inert across the entire test plot. The kites were gone.
The soil organisms -- the microscopic decomposers, the burrowing
detrivores -- showed declining activity. The test plot, which
twenty hours earlier had been a functioning, if terrified, ecosystem,
was becoming a dead zone.

"Shut it down," Sorensen said. Her voice was flat, controlled, but
Yael could hear the edge beneath it. "Introduce the reversal
compound. Now."


                               V.

The reversal compound -- Kenji's team had synthesized it as a
precaution, a molecular antagonist that would block the suppression
compound and allow the fear chemistry to resume -- was dispersed
over the test plot at hour twenty-two.

It was too late for the grazers. Dead organisms do not resume
biological processes. But the filaments -- some of them, the ones
at the periphery of the test plot where the suppression compound
had been weakest -- showed a response. The fear chemistry flickered
back to life. The pale filaments flushed faintly blue-green, a
whisper of color returning, and Yael's sensors detected the
resumption of photosynthetic activity in scattered patches.

Over the following seventy-two hours, the peripheral filaments
recovered. Fear returned to them, and with fear, function. They
photosynthesized. They grew. They resumed the continuous production
of fear compounds that was, apparently, the prerequisite for every
other metabolic process.

The center of the test plot did not recover. It remained white, inert,
dead -- a one-hectare scar on the surface of the meadow, visible
from the observation platform as a pale disc surrounded by the
blue-green of the living, terrified ecosystem.

New grazers did not enter the dead zone. Kites did not fly over it.
The organisms of the surrounding meadow treated it the way organisms
on Earth treated a toxic spill -- as a place to be avoided, a
wound in the landscape that the healthy tissue grew around but did
not attempt to heal.


                              VI.

The evening after the reversal, the research team held what Sorensen
called a "data integration session" and what was, in practice, an
argument.

They sat in the common room, which still smelled of coffee and
atmospheric leakage, and they tried to make sense of what they had
observed. The data were unambiguous. The interpretation was not.

"The fear response is load-bearing," Kenji said. He had been working
through the biochemistry all day, mapping the molecular pathways
that connected the fear signaling to the organisms' basic metabolic
processes, and his face had the drawn, focused look of a man who had
found something profound and disturbing. "It's not a byproduct or
an epiphenomenon. The fear-signaling cascade is directly integrated
with the metabolic regulation systems. In the filaments, the stress
hormones are required co-factors for the photosynthetic enzymes.
Without fear, photosynthesis cannot proceed. In the grazers, the
stress response drives the motor-activation pathways. Without fear,
voluntary movement ceases."

"Fear is their ATP," Yael said, reaching for an analogy that would
make the finding graspable.

"More fundamental than that. ATP is an energy currency. Fear is --"
Kenji paused, searching for the right framework. "Fear is their
organizational principle. On Earth, life is organized around energy
acquisition. Photosynthesis, chemosynthesis, predation -- every
organism's fundamental activity is obtaining and processing energy.
On Kepler-442b, life is organized around fear. Fear is the signal
that initiates and sustains every biological process. Remove the
fear, and the organism has no reason to do anything. No reason to
photosynthesize, no reason to move, no reason to metabolize, no
reason to live."

The room was silent. Outside, through the dome's observation
windows, the meadow stretched to the horizon, blue-green and
rippling, every filament and grazer and kite in its continuous
state of biochemical terror, and all of it -- all of it -- alive.

"That's insane," said Dr. Pavel Orlov, the team's geochemist, a
blunt man who distrusted biology on principle and believed that
the physical sciences were the only ones that dealt in reality.
"You're saying this planet evolved life that only functions when
it's terrified? What's the selective advantage?"

"The selective advantage is existence," Marcus said.

Everyone looked at him. He had been quiet throughout the discussion,
sitting in his corner with his arms folded, but now he leaned
forward, and Yael saw in his eyes the expression she had come to
recognize as the moment when Marcus's understanding of an ecosystem
clicked into focus -- a look that was not quite excitement and not
quite sorrow but something that partook of both.

"On Earth," he said, "we think of fear as a response to threat.
Something dangerous appears, you feel fear, you run or fight. Fear
is reactive. It's triggered by an external stimulus. But that's not
what's happening here. Here, fear is constitutive. It's not a
response to a threat. It's the basic condition of being alive."

"That doesn't explain --" Orlov began.

"Let me finish. On Earth, the fundamental driver of evolution is
competition for resources. Organisms that acquire more energy, more
nutrients, more territory, reproduce more successfully. The
selective pressure is toward efficiency, toward better ways of
getting and using what you need. On Kepler-442b, the fundamental
driver is different. It's fear. Organisms that are more afraid --
that produce more fear chemistry, that respond more intensely to
the fear signal -- function more effectively. They photosynthesize
more, they move more, they metabolize more. Fear doesn't just keep
them alive. It is the mechanism by which they are alive."

"But what are they afraid of?" Orlov demanded.

Marcus looked at him with an expression of infinite patience.

"Nothing. Everything. It doesn't matter. The fear has no object.
It's not fear of predators, fear of starvation, fear of death. It's
fear itself -- fear as a pure biological signal, detached from any
specific threat, functioning as the universal activator of all
living processes on this planet. You're asking what the fear is for.
The answer is: everything. Without it, there is nothing."

Silence. Then Sorensen, in a voice that was carefully steady:

"So what you're telling me is that we cannot remove fear from this
ecology without killing it."

"That is exactly what I'm telling you."

"And the implications for colonization?"

Marcus leaned back. "You'd have to ask the Colonial Biology Division.
But I'll tell you what an ecologist would say. This is an ecology
that runs on fear the way ours runs on sunlight. You can't terraform
it. You can't modify it. You can't make it compatible with human
habitation without destroying it, because the first thing humans do
when they encounter fear is try to eliminate it. And on this planet,
eliminating fear eliminates life."

"Surely we can design containment protocols --"

"You saw what happened in one hectare in twenty hours. The fear
ecology is interconnected. Every organism's fear compounds are part
of the chemical environment that sustains every other organism's
fear. It's not a collection of individually afraid organisms. It's
a planetary fear network. Disrupt it in one place and the disruption
propagates."

Sorensen turned to Yael. "Is that consistent with your data?"

Yael thought of the kites, flying away from the test plot before
anything visible had changed. Sensing the absence of fear in the
chemical environment and recognizing it as danger -- the way a
terrestrial organism might sense the absence of oxygen.

"Yes," she said. "The fear is communal. They're not just individually
afraid. They're afraid together. And the communal fear is what
sustains the ecology."

Sorensen sat down. She looked old, suddenly -- all fifty-three years
visible in the lines of her face and the set of her shoulders. She
was a practical woman, a manager, and the practical implications of
what her team was telling her were devastating. A habitable planet
whose ecology could not survive contact with organisms that did not
share its fear.

"Write it up," she said. "All of it. Intervention data, biochemical
analysis, ecological assessment. I'll send the recommendation to
the Colonial Biology Division."

"What recommendation?" Marcus asked.

"That Kepler-442b be classified as ecologically incompatible with
human colonization. That no further intervention experiments be
conducted. That the planet be designated a research preserve."

"They won't accept it," Marcus said. "The colonial program needs
habitable worlds. They'll send another team, with better
suppression compounds, with targeted modifications, with a plan
to gradually acclimate the ecology to lower fear levels. They'll
call it adaptation. They'll call it management."

"Maybe. But the recommendation will be on record."

"On record," Marcus repeated. He looked at the pale disc of the
dead test plot, visible through the observation window in the
gathering dusk, a wound in the terrified meadow that would not
heal. "Yes. That's what we do. We put things on record."


                              VII.

Yael went out alone the next morning, before the others were awake.

She walked to the edge of the dead zone and stood there, at the
boundary between the white, inert filaments of the test plot and
the blue-green, rippling, living filaments of the intact meadow.
The boundary was sharp -- a line drawn in biochemistry, separating
life from death, fear from its absence.

She calibrated her sensor and took readings. On the dead side:
nothing. No fear chemistry, no metabolic activity, no life. On the
living side: the full spectrum of fear compounds, the sustained
stress response, the jittering grazers, the wheeling kites, the
whole terrified, functioning ecology.

She stood at the boundary and thought about what they had found.

On Earth, she reflected, fear was understood as a problem to be
solved. Anxiety was a disorder. Stress was a disease. The entire
apparatus of modern psychology and pharmacology was directed at
reducing fear, managing it, medicating it into submission. The
assumption was that a life without fear would be a better life --
freer, healthier, more fully lived.

But what if that assumption was parochial? What if it was a
peculiarity of Earth's evolutionary history -- a planet where fear
happened to be a response rather than a foundation? What if there
were worlds where fear was not the enemy of life but its engine?
Where the terror was not a flaw in the system but the system itself?

She looked at the grazers, jittering across the blue-green
filaments, their flat bodies rippling with the muscular contractions
of sustained biochemical terror. They were afraid. They had always
been afraid. They would always be afraid. And in their fear, they
lived -- they moved, they fed, they reproduced, they participated
in the intricate web of ecological relationships that sustained
every other organism on the planet.

Remove the fear, and they died. Not from what replaced the fear --
nothing replaced it. They died from the absence itself. The absence
of fear was not peace. It was vacancy. It was the cessation of the
signal that meant continue, that meant live, that meant there is
reason to go on.

Yael thought about Earth. About the wars being fought there at this
moment, on the distant blue world she had left three years ago.
About the fear that drove those wars -- the fear of the enemy, the
fear of loss, the fear of a world reshaped by forces beyond control.
And about the dream that animated the peace movements, the utopian
projects, the pharmacological interventions: the dream of a world
without fear.

She had shared that dream. She had believed in it. She had come
to Kepler-442b as a biologist, seeking understanding, and she had
found something that challenged the deepest assumptions of her
discipline and her species.

Fear was not the aberration. Peace was not the natural state from
which fear was a deviation. On this world, at least, the opposite
was true. Fear was the natural state. Fear was the organizing
principle. Fear was the reason anything happened at all.

And peace -- the peace of the dead test plot, the peace of the
white, inert filaments, the peace of the motionless grazers and
the empty sky -- was death.

She stood at the boundary for a long time, feeling the wind on
her face, watching the terrified meadow ripple and jitter and
live. Then she turned off her sensor, put it in her pack, and
walked back to the station.

Behind her, the dead zone remained. A hectare of peace in a world
of fear.

Nothing grew there. Nothing moved. Nothing was afraid.

Nothing at all.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       DREAMERS' REPUBLIC

                      by Julian St. Croix

================================================================================

                               I.

They had built the republic in the space between sleeping and waking,
in the luminous architecture of shared dreaming, and it was -- let
this be stated at the outset, before the complications and the grief
and the impossible choice that would shatter everything -- it was
beautiful.

Not beautiful in the way that waking things are beautiful, which is
to say constrained by the tyranny of physics, by the brutish
insistence of matter upon behaving according to rules it did not
choose and cannot articulate. Beautiful in the way that only a
collectively dreamed world can be beautiful: with the layered,
impossible coherence of a cathedral painted by a hundred hands, each
hand following its own vision and yet somehow -- through some alchemy
of shared intention that none of them could have named -- producing a
whole that exceeded the sum of its parts by the precise margin that
separates architecture from miracle.

The Republic of Somnus -- the name had been proposed by Leander, who
loved classical allusion, and accepted by the others with the amused
tolerance they extended to all of Leander's enthusiasms -- existed
in a dreamscape maintained by seventeen sleepers in seventeen
separate locations across the waking world, each one connected to
the shared space through a neural interface that Dr. Cressida Vane
had designed in her laboratory at the University of Edinburgh and
then, in a moment of either inspiration or madness, decided to
use rather than merely study.

The interface was simple in principle, baroque in execution. It
synchronized the dream states of connected sleepers, allowing their
individual dreamscapes to merge into a single, shared environment
whose properties were determined by the collective unconscious of
the group. Each dreamer contributed -- not deliberately, not through
any act of conscious will, but through the deeper contributions of
the dreaming mind, which offered images, textures, architectural
forms, and physical laws the way a jazz musician offers notes to an
improvisation: spontaneously, intuitively, in response to what the
others were playing.

The result was Somnus: a world that changed nightly and yet
maintained a continuity of identity that none of its creators fully
understood. There were constants -- the Agora, a vast circular plaza
of luminous stone where the dreamers gathered; the Library, which
contained books that wrote themselves and could be read in any
language including several that did not exist; the Garden, where
flowers bloomed in colors that the waking eye had no names for, in
geometries that Euclid had never imagined. And there were variables --
the weather, which reflected the collective emotional state of the
dreamers; the architecture of the outlying districts, which shifted
and recombined like a kaleidoscope turned by seventeen hands; and
the physics, which was the subject of the Republic's most passionate
and most consequential debates.

Because in Somnus, the laws of physics were decided by vote.

This was Cressida's innovation, and it was, she maintained, the
logical extension of the shared dreaming technology. If the
dreamscape was collectively generated, then its fundamental
properties were collectively determined. The question was whether to
leave that determination to the unconscious -- to allow the
dreamscape's physics to emerge from the unexamined assumptions of
seventeen sleeping minds -- or to make it conscious, deliberate,
democratic. Cressida chose democracy.

And so, on the third night of the Republic's existence, standing in
the Agora under a sky that was simultaneously purple, amber, and a
color that Leander had contributed and which he called "the hue of
philosophical perplexity," Cressida proposed the first Referendum of
Physics.

"Shall gravity operate in the traditional manner," she said, her
voice carrying across the luminous plaza with the clarity that
dream-voices possess, unimpeded by atmosphere or distance, "or
shall we adopt an alternative?"

The seventeen dreamers -- professors and poets, a retired barrister,
a cellist, two painters, a mathematician, a former soldier who
dreamed in landscapes of terrible beauty, and Cressida herself --
debated for what felt like hours but was, in waking time, perhaps
eleven minutes. The debate was passionate, erudite, and occasionally
absurd. Leander argued for variable gravity, stronger in the Agora
and weaker in the outlying districts, on the grounds that "the
center of civilization should carry more weight, both literally and
figuratively." The mathematician, a precise and humorless woman
named Dr. Isolde Kwan, proposed that gravity be inversely
proportional to altitude, so that walking uphill would become
progressively easier -- "a physical metaphor," she said, "for the
philosophical truth that effort should be rewarded with lightness."

They voted. Variable gravity was adopted, twelve to five. And the
dreamscape changed.

Not abruptly -- the transition was gentle, as though the world
itself were a courteous host, accommodating its guests' preferences
without disrupting the dinner. Gravity shifted, softened in the
higher elevations, strengthened near the ground, and the dreamers
felt it -- felt the world respond to their collective decision, felt
the exhilarating and slightly terrifying power of minds that could
reshape reality by consensus.

"We have built something unprecedented," Cressida said that night,
standing on a balcony overlooking the Agora, where Leander was
testing the new gravity by leaping from increasingly high surfaces
with the gleeful abandon of a child on a trampoline. "A democracy
of the real. A society where the laws of nature are not imposed but
chosen."

"Chosen by vote," said Marcus Thorne, who stood beside her. He was
the former soldier, a man of fifty with silver hair and eyes that
had seen things he did not discuss, who had joined the experiment
because he could not sleep without nightmares and had hoped that
shared dreaming might replace his private horrors with something
more bearable. "And what happens when the vote is wrong?"

"Wrong by what standard? In the waking world, physics is not subject
to democratic revision. In Somnus, it is. There is no 'wrong' -- only
what the Republic decides."

"That," Marcus said, "is either the most liberating or the most
dangerous sentence I have ever heard."

Cressida smiled. In the dream, her smile was luminous -- not
metaphorically, but actually, the way things were in Somnus, where
metaphor and reality had not yet learned to maintain their proper
distance.

"Perhaps both," she said. "Shall we vote on it?"


                              II.

The Republic of Somnus flourished for one hundred and twelve nights.

They voted on everything. Gravity was revised three times. Light was
made to behave as both wave and particle simultaneously, after a
contentious referendum in which the painters argued for wave and the
mathematician argued for particle and Leander argued for "something
no one has thought of yet," which carried the day. Sound was made
synesthetic -- in Somnus, you could see music, literally see it,
cascading through the air in ribbons of color and form, and the
cellist wept the first time she played and watched her Bach
partita unfold as a cathedral of translucent light.

They voted on biology. Flowers were permitted to sing. Trees could
walk, slowly, in stately promenades through the Garden, their roots
lifting from the dreamed soil with a sound like whispered
conversation. The dreamers themselves could fly, or breathe water,
or pass through walls, depending on the current physics regime and
their personal relationship with the night's consensus reality.

They voted on politics. The Republic adopted a constitution --
drafted by the barrister, amended by everyone, a document of
extraordinary elegance that began: "We, the Dreamers, in order to
form a more perfect unreality..." Offices were created and filled.
Cressida was elected Chancellor. Leander was appointed Minister of
Aesthetics, a position he had invented for himself and which
everyone agreed was both absurd and essential. Marcus became, without
election or appointment, the Republic's moral compass -- the quiet
voice that asked the uncomfortable questions, the soldier who had
seen what happens when power is exercised without restraint and
who brought that knowledge to bear on even the most whimsical
deliberations.

They were happy. Yael -- this Yael was not the biologist from the
previous story but a painter, a young woman from Tel Aviv who
painted landscapes in the waking world and discovered in Somnus that
she could paint realities -- said it best, on the sixty-third night,
standing in a gallery of her own creation where her paintings hung
in frames made of solidified starlight: "I have been awake for
thirty years and I have never been this alive."

The others agreed. In letters and conversations in the waking world,
they described the Republic with a fervor that made their friends
and families uneasy. They counted the hours until sleep. They
shortened their waking activities. Dr. Kwan, the mathematician,
began sleeping fourteen hours a day, arriving in Somnus early and
staying late, working on equations that described the dreamscape's
meta-physics -- the physics of physics, the rules governing how
rules could be changed -- with an intensity that worried even
Cressida.

"We are spending more time in the dream than out of it," Marcus
observed on the eighty-first night, during a session of the Agora
Council. "Some of us are neglecting our waking lives. I include
myself in that observation."

"Is that a problem?" Leander asked. He was draped across a floating
chaise longue of his own design, wearing a toga made of woven
moonlight, eating grapes that tasted of music. "The waking world is
-- forgive me -- somewhat limited. Gravity goes one way. Light
behaves boringly. One cannot fly. One cannot pass through walls.
One is subject to the tedious constraints of biology and the even
more tedious constraints of politics. Here, we are free."

"Free from physics," Marcus said. "Not free from ourselves. We
bring ourselves into this dream, Leander. Our virtues and our
failings. And I am beginning to see the failings more clearly
than the virtues."

"Such as?"

"Such as the vote last week to make pain optional. A humane decision,
on its face. But without pain, how do we know when something is
wrong? Pain is information. We voted it away because it was
unpleasant, and in doing so we removed a warning system that
exists for a reason."

"A reason that pertains to biological organisms in a physical world,"
Cressida interjected. "We are neither, in this context. We are
consciousness in a collectively dreamed space. The rules of biology
do not apply."

"Perhaps not. But the psychology does. We are still human minds,
Cressida, even in the dream. And human minds that vote away every
discomfort are human minds that are losing the capacity to endure
discomfort. I worry about what we are becoming."

The Council debated. The debate was thoughtful, passionate, and --
as always in Somnus -- conducted in language of unusual beauty, as
though the dreamscape's influence extended to the quality of the
dreamers' rhetoric. In the end, they voted to maintain the
pain-optional policy but to establish a Review Committee on
Psychological Resilience, chaired by Marcus, to monitor the
long-term effects of their collective decisions on the dreamers'
mental health.

It was a reasonable compromise. It was also, Marcus knew, a way of
acknowledging his concern without actually addressing it -- the
democratic equivalent of a pat on the head. He accepted the
chairmanship with the wry grace of a man who has been outmaneuvered
and knows it, and resolved to watch more carefully.

He did not have to watch for long.


                             III.

On the hundred and seventh night, Dr. Isolde Kwan did not wake up.

The discovery was made in the waking world, by Kwan's sister,
who had been checking on her daily since Kwan had reduced her
waking hours to six and then to four and then to three. She found
Kwan in her bed, the neural interface active, her vital signs
stable, her brain activity indicating deep, sustained REM sleep.
She was not unconscious. She was not in a coma. She was dreaming,
and she would not stop.

In Somnus, Kwan was at her desk in the Library, surrounded by
scrolls of equations that described the meta-physics of the
dreamscape in a mathematical language she had been developing for
weeks. She looked up when Cressida appeared, and her expression --
calm, focused, luminous with a certainty that was either wisdom
or madness -- stopped Cressida in the doorway.

"I know," Kwan said. "My sister is trying to wake me. I can feel
it -- her hand on my shoulder, in the other world. I am choosing
not to respond."

"Isolde --"

"I have thought about this carefully, Cressida. I am a mathematician.
I deal in proof. And I have proved, to my own satisfaction, that
this is the better world."

She held up a scroll. The equations were beyond Cressida's
comprehension -- Kwan's meta-physics had evolved past the point
where anyone else in the Republic could follow the mathematics --
but the conclusion, written in plain language at the bottom of the
scroll, was clear:

"Theorem: The Republic of Somnus is ontologically equivalent to
waking reality and functionally superior in all measurable
dimensions of conscious experience. Corollary: Remaining in Somnus
is not an escape from reality but a selection of the optimal reality
from among available alternatives."

"You can't live in a dream, Isolde."

"Why not? My body is maintained by the interface -- hydration,
nutrition, waste elimination. The technology exists. Cressida, you
designed it."

"I designed it for temporary use. Shared dreaming as a research
tool, as an artistic medium, as a form of social experiment. Not
as a permanent habitation."

"Why not?"

"Because --" Cressida stopped. Because why? Because it was a dream?
But the dream was real -- she had argued this herself, in the Agora,
in the debates about physics and politics and the nature of reality.
The dreamscape was not a hallucination. It was a collectively
maintained reality, generated by conscious minds, governed by
democratic consensus. It was, in every meaningful sense, a world.

"Because you'll die," she said finally. "Your body will fail
eventually, no matter what the interface does. You'll age, you'll
weaken, and one day the biological substrate that supports your
dreaming mind will give out, and you'll --"

"Die. Yes. I will die. As I would have died in the waking world,
where I would also have aged, also weakened, also given out. The
question is not whether I will die but where I will live until I
do. And I choose to live here."

Cressida looked at Kwan -- at her calm face, her steady eyes, the
scrolls of equations surrounding her like the petals of a
mathematical flower -- and felt something shift inside her, a
tectonic movement of certainty, as though one of the fundamental
laws of her personal physics were being revised by a vote she had
not called and could not veto.

"The others will follow you," she said. "If you stay, they'll want
to stay."

"Yes. Some of them."

"And if enough of them stay, the Republic changes. It stops being
a place we visit and becomes a place we inhabit. And then it's not
an experiment anymore. It's a world. With all the complications
and responsibilities that implies."

"Is that not what we wanted? A better world? We said it, Cressida,
in the Agora, in the debates, in the constitution itself: 'We, the
Dreamers, in order to form a more perfect unreality.' We have formed
it. Now I am choosing to live in it. You designed the door. I am
walking through it."

Cressida left the Library and went to the Agora, where the other
dreamers were gathered, their faces reflecting the amber and purple
and philosophically perplexed light of the Somnian sky. They knew.
The news had traveled through the dreamscape the way news travels
in a small community -- instantly, invisibly, through the shared
substrate of consciousness that connected them all.

"Kwan has made her choice," Cressida said. "The question is what
we do about it."


                              IV.

The debate lasted three nights.

It was the most passionate, the most painful, and the most
consequential debate in the Republic's short history, and it took
place not in the Agora -- the formal setting felt wrong for a
discussion of this gravity -- but in the Garden, among the walking
trees and the singing flowers, where the beauty of the dreamscape
served as both argument and counter-argument.

Leander spoke first, because Leander always spoke first, and
because on this occasion his usual flamboyance had been replaced
by a seriousness that surprised everyone.

"I want to stay," he said. "I have wanted to stay since the third
night, when we voted on gravity and I felt the world change. In
the waking world, I am a lecturer in classics at a minor university.
My students are indifferent. My colleagues are tedious. My flat is
cold and damp and smells of the kebab shop downstairs. Here, I am
the Minister of Aesthetics. I shape reality. I live in a world
that responds to beauty because we have voted to make beauty one
of its fundamental properties. I would be mad to leave."

"You would be mad to stay," said Dr. Anwar Rashid, the barrister,
who had drafted the Republic's constitution and who now found
himself in the uncomfortable position of having to argue against
the implications of his own document. "Kwan's theorem is
mathematically elegant, but it contains a hidden assumption: that
conscious experience is the only measure of reality. What about
the waking world? What about the people who depend on us there?
What about -- and I say this as a man who helped write a
constitution for a dream -- what about our responsibilities to
the reality we were born into?"

"What responsibilities?" Leander asked. "We did not choose to be
born into the waking world. We did choose to create this one. If
anything, our responsibility is greater here."

"You cannot abdicate the world."

"Can I not? People abdicate the world every day. They retreat into
art, into religion, into madness, into love. The only difference
is that we have somewhere better to retreat to."

Marcus spoke last. He stood in the center of the Garden, among the
walking trees, his silver hair catching the impossible light, and
the other dreamers fell silent because when Marcus spoke, the
quality of the silence changed -- it became attentive, expectant,
as though the dreamscape itself were listening.

"I have been a soldier," he said. "I have been in a war. And the
thing I learned about war -- the thing no one tells you -- is that
it is possible to become so accustomed to the horror that the
horror becomes normal. You adapt. Your threshold adjusts. Things
that would have destroyed you in your first week become routine by
your third month. The human mind is capable of normalizing anything,
including the unendurable.

"I see the same process at work here, but in reverse. We have
become accustomed to paradise. The wonders of Somnus -- the
impossible physics, the synesthetic music, the beauty that we voted
into existence -- have become our normal. And because our threshold
has adjusted upward, the waking world seems intolerable by
comparison. Not because the waking world has changed, but because
we have.

"Kwan wants to stay because the dream is better than reality. But
the dream is better than reality because we made it better. We
voted for beauty. We voted against pain. We voted for variable
gravity and synesthetic sound and flowers that sing. We made a
world that is perfectly calibrated to our desires, and now we are
surprised that we prefer it to a world that is not?

"This is not freedom. This is the most sophisticated trap I have
ever encountered. We have built a prison so beautiful that the
prisoners petition to have the doors welded shut."

The Garden was quiet. The walking trees had stopped their slow
promenade. The singing flowers held a note -- a long, sustained,
minor-key tone that seemed to emanate from the soil itself, as
though the dreamscape were offering its own commentary on Marcus's
words.

"Then what do you propose?" Cressida asked.

"I propose we wake up."

"All of us?"

"All of us. Including Kwan. We disconnect the interfaces, we return
to the waking world, and we dismantle Somnus."

The reaction was immediate, visceral, and nearly unanimous in its
opposition. Leander was on his feet, his toga of woven moonlight
blazing. Yael the painter clutched the frame of her most recent
creation -- a landscape of a world that could not exist, rendered
in colors that could not be seen, heartbreakingly beautiful. The
cellist, who had not spoken during any of the debates, made a sound
that was not quite a word but was clearly a protest, a musical
negation that hung in the air like a dissonant chord.

"You're asking us to destroy what we've built," Cressida said.

"I'm asking you to choose reality over perfection. They are not
the same thing, and the inability to distinguish between them is
the most dangerous form of madness I know."

"And if we vote against you?"

"Then I'll wake up alone. And Somnus will continue without me. But
I will not stay in a dream, no matter how beautiful, while the
waking world -- with all its ugliness and all its pain and all its
tiresome, magnificent, indispensable imperfection -- goes on
without me."

They voted. The vote was nine to eight to continue the Republic.
Marcus was in the minority.

He looked at the result -- the narrowest possible margin, a single
vote separating the dream from the waking -- and nodded once, the
way a soldier nods when he receives an order he disagrees with but
will follow, because the alternative is to stop being a soldier.

Except that Marcus did not follow the order. He stood in the Garden,
among the frozen trees and the sustained minor note of the flowers,
and he said:

"I will leave in the morning. I want one more night."

"One more night for what?" Cressida asked.

"To remember what we built. Before I lose it."


                               V.

Marcus Thorne's last night in the Republic of Somnus was also its
most beautiful.

He walked the city alone -- or rather, he walked it in the company
of the city itself, which responded to his solitary passage with
a tenderness that suggested the dreamscape knew he was leaving and
wished to give him something to take with him.

The Agora was empty, luminous, vast. The stone was warm beneath his
feet -- a warmth that was not merely physical but emotional, the
accumulated warmth of a hundred and twelve nights of conversation,
debate, laughter, and the particular intensity that comes from minds
that are building something together and know they are building
something unprecedented.

He sat on a bench at the edge of the Agora and looked up at the
sky, which was, tonight, all the colors at once -- Leander's amber,
Cressida's purple, Kwan's precise mathematical blue, Yael's
painter's palette of impossible hues, and the nameless color that
Marcus himself had contributed and which the others called "the
shade of earned sadness."

He remembered the first night. The confusion and the wonder. The
discovery that they were sharing a space that none of them had
designed and all of them had made. The first tentative conversations,
voices in the dark, minds reaching for minds across the luminous
distance.

He remembered the debates. The Referendum of Physics. The night they
voted to make sound visible. The night Leander proposed, only half-
jokingly, that they abolish Monday.

He remembered the cellist playing Bach in the Garden while the
trees walked slowly around her and the flowers harmonized and the
equations on Kwan's scrolls danced in the air like algebraic
fireflies, and he had stood in the back of the crowd and felt --
for the first time since the war -- something he could only call
joy. Not happiness, which is a mood, but joy, which is a recognition:
a recognition that the world, or a world, could contain beauty
sufficient to justify the pain of being conscious in it.

He got up from the bench and walked to the Library. Kwan was there,
as she always was, surrounded by her scrolls, her calm face
illuminated by the self-luminous text.

"I came to say goodbye, Isolde."

She looked up. In the dream, her eyes held the clarity of perfect
equations -- precise, self-consistent, beautiful in the way that
mathematical truths are beautiful.

"You are making a mistake, Marcus."

"Probably. But it's my mistake to make. That's the thing about the
waking world -- it allows mistakes. Real ones. The kind you can't
vote to undo."

"And you prefer that?"

"I don't prefer it. I require it. A world where every error can be
corrected by referendum is a world where nothing matters. Consequence
is what gives choice its weight. I need my choices to be heavy."

Kwan studied him for a long moment. Then she did something she had
never done in the Republic -- she set down her equations, stood up
from her desk, and embraced him. It was, Marcus thought, the most
real thing that had happened in the dream. Not because the embrace
was physically convincing -- everything in Somnus was physically
convincing -- but because it was motivated by something the
dreamscape could not generate: genuine human loss, the awareness
of a connection being broken that could not be repaired.

"Goodbye, Marcus."

"Goodbye, Isolde. Take care of the Republic."

"It will take care of itself. That is the nature of the thing we
built."

He walked to the edge of the dreamscape -- the place where the
collectively dreamed world faded into the un-dreamed, the boundary
between the real unreal and the unrealized potential that surrounded
it. The boundary manifested, for Marcus, as a door. A simple wooden
door, of the kind you might find in a country house, slightly warped
by weather, with a brass knob tarnished by use.

On the other side of the door was morning. Gray, ordinary, waking
morning, with its fixed gravity and its non-synesthetic sound and
its pain that could not be voted away.

He put his hand on the knob.

He thought about Somnus. The Agora, warm and luminous. The Garden,
where trees walked and flowers sang. The Library, where Kwan sat
among her proofs of paradise. The sky of a hundred colors. The
world that they had built by consensus, a world where every law
was chosen, every beauty intended, every suffering optional.

He turned the knob and opened the door and stepped through.


                              VI.

Marcus Thorne woke in his flat in Brixton on a Tuesday morning in
November. The ceiling was cracked. The radiator was cold. Through
the window, he could see the gray London sky, featureless and low,
promising rain.

He removed the neural interface and set it on the nightstand. His
body felt heavy -- not the pleasant heaviness of waking from deep
sleep, but the leaden, sullen weight of a body that has been still
for too long and resents being asked to move. His knee ached. His
lower back announced itself with the familiar complaint that it had
been lodging since 1962, when a piece of shrapnel had taken up
permanent residence near his spine.

He stood up. The floor was cold. He walked to the kitchen and put
the kettle on and stood in the gray light, waiting for the water
to boil, and the ordinariness of the act -- the waiting, the kettle,
the gray light, the cold floor -- pressed against him like a physical
force.

He made tea. He drank it. It was terrible tea -- he had never been
good at making tea, a fact that fifty years of Englishness had
failed to correct -- and its terribleness was, in its way, a
comfort. In Somnus, tea could have been voted into perfection. Here,
it was what it was.

He sat at his kitchen table and looked at the neural interface on
the nightstand, visible through the doorway. A small device, no
larger than a hearing aid, that contained the doorway to a world
where gravity was variable and sound was visible and a man who had
been broken by war could feel joy.

He picked up the telephone and called Cressida's number. It rang
six times. She did not answer. He tried Leander. No answer. He
tried Yael, the barrister, the cellist. No answer. No answer.
No answer.

They were all asleep. They were all in Somnus. At nine o'clock on
a Tuesday morning, every member of the Republic was dreaming.

Marcus put down the telephone. He sat in his kitchen, in the gray
London light, with his terrible tea and his aching knee, and he
thought about the vote. Nine to eight. A single vote. If he had
voted differently -- if he had stayed -- the Republic would have
continued with his participation, and his presence might have
served as the anchor, the ballast, the connection to waking reality
that would have prevented --

No. He stopped that line of thought. It was the logic of the
dream, the seductive reasoning of a world where every path not
taken could be explored, every alternative weighed, every
possibility voted upon. In the waking world, choices were made
and their consequences were lived, and the roads not taken
disappeared behind you like footprints in rain.

He put the neural interface in a drawer. He put on his coat. He
walked out into the gray morning, into the noise and the cold and
the fixed, non-negotiable gravity of a world that did not care
whether he was happy, and he walked until his knee hurt and then
he walked some more, because pain was information and he had spent
too long in a place where information was optional.


                             VII.

The Republic of Somnus endured for eleven more months.

Marcus knew this because Cressida -- the last to go, the designer
of the door, the Chancellor of the dream -- wrote him a letter
before she stopped waking up. A real letter, pen on paper, posted
through the Royal Mail, which arrived on a Monday with a cup ring
on the envelope and a first-class stamp. In the age of shared
dreamscapes and neural interfaces, Cressida had chosen the most
analog medium available, and Marcus understood this as both a
kindness and a farewell.

Dear Marcus,

The Republic has voted to become permanent. The decision
was unanimous -- the first unanimous vote in our history,
which tells you something about the force of the
proposition.

Kwan was right. The mathematics bear it out, and more
importantly, the experience bears it out. Somnus is real.
Not metaphorically real, not psychologically real -- real
in every way that matters to a conscious mind, which is,
after all, the only entity for which reality is a meaningful
concept.

I know you disagree. I know you believe we are choosing
illusion over truth. But I want to suggest, one last time,
that the distinction between illusion and truth is less
stable than you think. What is the waking world but a
collectively maintained reality, generated by conscious
minds operating within a shared physical framework?
Somnus is the same thing, with better physics.

I am going to join the others. I am going to close my eyes
and walk through the door and not come back. My body will be
maintained by the interface. My affairs are in order. The
university has been notified. My solicitor has instructions.

I am not asking you to follow. I know you will not. You
are the man who walked away from paradise because paradise
was not real enough, and I respect that more than you know.
Perhaps you are wiser than the rest of us. Or perhaps you
are simply braver, or more stubborn, or more afraid. I do
not know. I know only that you were the Republic's
conscience, and without you, we voted our conscience away.

Take care of the waking world, Marcus. It needs people
like you. People who prefer the difficult truth to the
beautiful lie. People who choose the cold floor over the
warm dream.

I will miss you. In the dream, I will miss you always.

With love and with the profound sadness that is the
price of a real goodbye,

Cressida

Marcus read the letter three times. Then he folded it and put it
in the drawer with the neural interface, the two artifacts of a
world he had helped build and chosen to leave.

He stood at his kitchen window and looked out at Brixton. The
street was wet. A bus was pulling away from the stop, its
windows steamed. A woman was walking a dog that did not want to
walk. A child was jumping in a puddle with the single-minded
dedication that children bring to the only physics they understand.

None of it was beautiful, by the standards of Somnus. The gravity
was fixed. The sound was merely sound. The light was gray, and the
colors were limited, and the flowers did not sing, and the trees
were rooted in place and would never walk.

But the child was real. The puddle was real. The woman and the dog
and the bus and the rain were real, not because Marcus had voted
for them but because they existed independently of his consent,
his preference, his desire. The waking world did not ask permission
to be what it was. It simply was. And that obstinate, indifferent,
undemocratic existence was, Marcus thought, the most precious thing
about it.

He had built a world where everything could be changed by vote. He
had walked away from that world because he understood, with the
certainty of a man who had seen the worst of what human beings could
do and survived it, that a world where everything could be changed
was a world where nothing was solid. And he needed solid ground. Not
dreamed ground, however beautiful. Real ground, however flawed.

He made another cup of terrible tea and drank it standing at the
window, watching the rain fall on Brixton in the gray, gorgeous,
irreducible morning, and he did not regret his choice, even as he
missed the dream with an ache that was, he knew, the precise shape
and weight of the beautiful thing he had surrendered.

The Republic of Somnus continued. The dreamers dreamed. The Agora
glowed. The walking trees walked and the singing flowers sang and
the laws of physics yielded to the will of seventeen -- no, sixteen
-- no, fifteen -- sleeping minds.

And Marcus Thorne, awake and alone and aching, stepped out into the
rain and caught the bus to nowhere in particular, because in the
waking world, you did not need a destination to justify the journey.
You only needed to be awake.

The bus pulled away. The rain fell. The world -- the stubborn,
unchosen, intractable, irreplaceable, real world -- continued
without a vote.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       UNLICENSED FEELING

                       by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

Frank Kozlowski had been a pharmacist for twenty-two years, and in
all that time he had never once questioned the medications. That
was the job. The prescriptions came down from the Bureau of
Emotional Health, printed on pale blue paper with the Bureau's seal
-- a stylized brain cradled in two open hands -- and Frank filled
them. Mood stabilizers, affect regulators, anxiety suppressants,
grief limiters, anger attenuators. Every resident of Zone 7
received a personalized pharmacological regimen calibrated to their
psychological profile, their occupational requirements, and the
current Stability Index, which the Bureau updated weekly.

It was, everyone agreed, the humane thing. The rational thing. The
wars of the previous century had been traced, by the Bureau's
founding researchers, to unregulated emotion -- to rage and fear and
hatred allowed to run unchecked through populations whose neurochemistry
had evolved for small-group survival on the savannah and was
catastrophically unsuited to the complexities of modern civilization.
The solution was pharmacological management. Not the crude sedation of
earlier eras but precise, targeted modulation: each citizen's emotional
range adjusted to fall within parameters that permitted productivity,
social cohesion, and personal contentment without allowing the
dangerous extremes that had, in the unmedicated past, led to war,
revolution, and ecological collapse.

Frank believed in the system. He had grown up in it. His parents had
been medicated, and their parents before them. He had never
experienced unregulated emotion, and the descriptions he had read
in history texts -- the violence, the cruelty, the irrational
passions that had driven human beings to burn cities and murder
neighbors -- seemed to him as remote and incomprehensible as
descriptions of life before antibiotics. People used to die of
infected cuts. People used to murder each other over ideas. Both
facts were equally bewildering to a man whose emotional range had
been professionally managed since birth.

He filled the prescriptions. He ran the pharmacy. He went home to
his apartment in Block 14, ate dinner with his wife, Helen, watched
the evening broadcasts, and slept the deep, even sleep of a man
whose brain chemistry had been calibrated for optimal rest. His
life was stable, productive, and content, which were the three
adjectives the Bureau used to describe the successfully medicated
citizen, and which Frank had never questioned because questioning
required a degree of dissatisfaction that his medication did not
permit.

Then Mrs. Naomi Ortega came in with a broken dispenser.


                              II.

The dispensers were small, wearable devices -- worn behind the ear,
like a hearing aid -- that delivered the daily medication through a
transdermal patch. They were manufactured by the Bureau, calibrated
at the Bureau's central pharmacy, and distributed to zone pharmacists
like Frank for installation and maintenance. They were reliable,
efficient, and -- in twenty-two years -- Frank had never seen one
malfunction.

Mrs. Ortega's had cracked. She was a sixty-three-year-old retired
schoolteacher who lived alone in Block 11, a quiet woman with gray
hair and careful hands who came in every six months for her
dispenser maintenance and always brought Frank a loaf of the banana
bread she baked using a recipe from the pre-regulation era, which
she had found in her grandmother's things and which contained,
Frank suspected, an amount of sugar that the Bureau's nutritional
guidelines would not have approved.

"It fell off the nightstand," she said, holding out the cracked
device. "I didn't notice until this morning. I think it stopped
dispensing sometime in the night."

Frank examined the dispenser. The casing was cracked along one edge,
and the transdermal reservoir was empty -- not depleted through
normal use but drained, the medication having leaked out through
the crack. He checked the diagnostic log. The dispenser had stopped
functioning approximately fourteen hours ago.

Fourteen hours without medication. Frank looked at Mrs. Ortega
more carefully. She should have been showing withdrawal symptoms --
the Bureau's protocols listed them in descending order of severity:
irritability, mood fluctuation, emotional lability, anxiety,
depression, and in extreme cases, psychotic break. Fourteen hours
was well within the window for the milder symptoms.

Mrs. Ortega did not look irritable, fluctuating, or labile. She
looked -- and Frank struggled for the right word, because his
vocabulary for emotional states was limited to the Bureau's
approved terminology -- she looked vivid. Her eyes were brighter
than he remembered. Her hands, usually still and controlled, were
moving as she spoke, gesturing with an expressiveness that was
outside the normal range.

"How do you feel, Mrs. Ortega?"

"Feel?" She paused. The word seemed to catch her attention in a way
that surprised her. "I feel -- well, that's the thing, Mr. Kozlowski.
I feel. I woke up this morning and the light was coming through the
window, and it was -- I don't know how to describe it. It was
beautiful. The light. I've seen light through that window every
morning for eleven years, and this morning it was beautiful. And
I cried."

"You cried?"

"For no reason. For every reason. I stood in my kitchen and the
light was coming through the window and I cried, and it felt --"
She stopped. Her eyes were wet. "It felt like waking up. Like I've
been asleep for a very long time, and I just woke up."

Frank replaced her dispenser. He installed a new one, calibrated it
to her profile, confirmed that it was dispensing correctly, and
sent her home. He followed the protocol. He did his job.

But that night, in his apartment in Block 14, sitting across the
dinner table from Helen -- who was eating her dinner with the calm,
measured movements of a woman whose medication was functioning
perfectly -- Frank thought about the light. Mrs. Ortega had seen
light through her window and cried. Frank saw light through his
window every morning and felt nothing. Not unhappiness -- the
medication prevented unhappiness. But also not the thing Mrs.
Ortega had described. Not beauty. Not the overwhelming, tears-
producing experience of light as light, unmediated, unmodulated,
raw.

He thought about it all evening. He thought about it while Helen
watched the broadcasts and while he brushed his teeth and while
he lay in bed waiting for sleep. The thinking had a quality he
was not familiar with -- an insistence, a pressure, as though the
thought were demanding something from him, pushing against the
walls of his emotional range like a fist pressing against a window.

In the morning, he went to the pharmacy and did something he had
never done in twenty-two years.

He opened a dispenser and looked inside.


                             III.

The mechanism was simple. A reservoir, a micropump, a transdermal
delivery system. The medication was a clear liquid -- the Bureau's
proprietary compound, manufactured at the central pharmacy and
shipped to zone pharmacists in sealed cartridges. Frank had never
analyzed the compound. He was a dispenser pharmacist, not a
formulation chemist. His job was to install, calibrate, and
maintain. The compound itself was the Bureau's business.

But he was a pharmacist. He had training. He had equipment --
not much, but enough. He had a spectrometer, a centrifuge, and
a reference library of pharmaceutical compounds that the Bureau
required him to maintain for quality-control purposes.

He ran the analysis on his lunch break, using a cartridge from
inventory. The compound was, as he had expected, a complex
mixture of neuroactive substances -- serotonin modulators,
dopamine regulators, norepinephrine attenuators, cortisol
suppressors. Standard psychopharmacology, precisely formulated.
Nothing unexpected.

Except the dosage.

Frank compared the compound's concentrations to the reference
values in his pharmaceutical library. The reference values were
derived from clinical literature -- the published, peer-reviewed
studies that established the therapeutic ranges for each substance.
The Bureau's compound used concentrations that were, in every case,
at the extreme upper end of the therapeutic range. And in two
cases -- the serotonin modulator and the dopamine regulator -- the
concentrations exceeded the therapeutic range by a factor of 1.6.

Frank stared at the numbers. He ran the analysis again. Same result.

The Bureau's medication was not calibrating emotions within a
normal range. It was suppressing them to a level significantly
below normal. The "stability" that the Bureau promised -- the
even-keeled, productive, contented state that every citizen of
Zone 7 experienced as normal life -- was not the natural midpoint
of human emotional experience. It was an artificially depressed
state, maintained by doses that exceeded clinical recommendations,
producing a population that was not stable but flattened.

Not calm. Muted.

Not content. Numb.

Frank closed his spectrometer and put the cartridge back in
inventory and went about his afternoon appointments and did not,
for the remainder of the day, feel anything about what he had
discovered, because his dispenser was functioning correctly and
his medication was at the Bureau-specified level and his emotional
range was calibrated for stability, productivity, and contentment.

But the thought persisted. The pressure against the window.

That night, before bed, he removed his dispenser. He set it on
the nightstand, next to the glass of water and the book he was
reading -- a Bureau-approved novel about a pharmacist who prevented
an epidemic -- and he went to sleep without medication for the
first time in his life.

He woke at three in the morning in a state of terror.

Not the rational, manageable concern that his medication permitted.
Terror. His heart hammered. His breath came in short, ragged gasps.
The darkness in his bedroom was not the neutral absence of light he
experienced every night but a presence -- thick, suffocating,
pressing against him from all sides. He could hear his own pulse
in his ears, could feel sweat on his palms, could sense the primal,
animal alertness of a body that had been chemically restrained for
forty-six years and was, for the first time, awake.

He lay in the dark and shook.

Then, gradually, the terror subsided. Not because it went away --
it continued, a background hum of anxiety that would take days to
fade -- but because other things arrived. The darkness softened.
The sound of Helen breathing beside him -- a sound he had heard
every night for nineteen years -- resolved into something he had
never noticed: a specific, individual, irreplaceable rhythm, her
breath and no one else's, and the fact that she was there, beside
him, alive and breathing, struck him with a force that he
recognized, from the Bureau's educational materials, as love.

Not the approved version. Not the modulated, managed, appropriate
affection that the Bureau's compound permitted between marital
partners. Love. The real thing, unmeasured and overwhelming, the
full-spectrum emotion that the Bureau had decided was too dangerous
for daily use, and which was, Frank now understood, dangerous
precisely because it was true.

He lay in the dark and felt it all -- the terror and the love and
the grief for forty-six years of not feeling them -- and he wept,
quietly, so as not to wake Helen, in whose medicated sleep the
world was stable, productive, and content.

In the morning, he put his dispenser back on. He went to work. He
filled prescriptions.

But now he knew what was behind the window. And the pressure was
no longer a thought. It was a plan.


                              IV.

He started small. Three dispensers. Three patients he knew well --
Mrs. Ortega, who had already tasted fourteen hours of unmedicated
life; Thomas Cho, a twenty-eight-year-old mechanic who had once
told Frank, in a rare moment of unguarded speech, that he sometimes
wondered what music sounded like to people before the regulation;
and David Alvarado, a forty-year-old painter who produced the
bland, technically competent, emotionally inert work that the Bureau's
cultural guidelines encouraged and who, Frank suspected, was capable
of something more.

He did not stop their medication. He reduced it. Using the
spectrometer and the reference library, he reformulated their
cartridges, bringing the concentrations down from the Bureau's
levels to the clinical therapeutic range -- still medicated, still
modulated, but modulated to the level that the published research
indicated was appropriate rather than the suppressive level the
Bureau had imposed.

The difference, on paper, was subtle. A reduction of approximately
thirty-eight percent across all compounds. From the outside, the
patients would appear normal -- still calm, still functional, still
within the Bureau's behavioral parameters. But their emotional
range would widen. The ceiling would rise. The experiences that the
Bureau's dosage had flattened into a narrow band of acceptable
feeling would begin to expand toward something resembling the full
human spectrum.

He did not tell them what he had done. He could not -- the Bureau's
regulations prohibited pharmacists from discussing medication
specifics with patients, and in any case, he did not know how to
explain what he intended. He simply replaced their cartridges during
their routine maintenance visits and sent them home.

The effects took ten days to manifest.

Mrs. Ortega was first. She came into the pharmacy on a Tuesday,
not for an appointment but simply to visit, and Frank saw
immediately that something had changed. She was wearing a red
scarf -- a vivid, aggressive red that the Bureau's fashion
guidelines would have classified as "emotionally provocative" --
and she was smiling, not the pleasant, moderate smile that the
medication produced but a wide, uncontrolled, slightly asymmetrical
grin that made her look ten years younger.

"Mr. Kozlowski," she said. "I've started painting."

"Painting?"

"Watercolors. I haven't painted since I was a girl -- before my
medication was calibrated, you know, when they still let children
have a few unmedicated years. But last week I saw a sunset, and
it was -- I don't have the words. It was so beautiful it hurt.
And I thought: I need to put this down. I need to capture it. So
I bought paints."

She showed him a painting. It was crude, untrained, the work of a
sixty-three-year-old woman who had not held a brush since childhood.
It was also -- and Frank recognized this with a shock of something
his medication struggled to contain -- alive. The colors were
wrong, the proportions were off, the technique was nonexistent.
But the sunset blazed from the paper with a fierce, unregulated
joy that nothing in Frank's twenty-two years of Bureau-approved
visual experience had prepared him for.

Thomas Cho did not come to the pharmacy. Frank heard about him from
a neighbor -- Cho had been playing music, loudly, in his apartment.
Not the approved recreational music that the Bureau's cultural
division produced, which was pleasant and unremarkable and designed
to support emotional equilibrium, but something else: improvisations
on a guitar that Cho had apparently been keeping in a closet since
before his calibration, playing for hours, the sound carrying
through the walls of Block 9, alternately beautiful and terrible,
technically incompetent but emotionally devastating.

His neighbors had complained. Not about the noise -- noise complaints
were handled by building management -- but about the feeling. Cho's
music made them feel things. Unspecified things. Things outside
their calibrated range. One neighbor used the word "disturbing."
Another used the word "wonderful." Both words carried the same
undertone of alarm: something was happening that the medication
should have prevented.

David Alvarado's change was the most dramatic. The painter, who had
spent fifteen years producing the kind of art that decorated Bureau
offices -- competent, pleasant, inoffensive -- destroyed his
studio. Not violently -- methodically, carefully, with the focused
intensity of a man who has recognized that everything he has created
is a lie and cannot bear to look at it anymore. He stacked his
canvases in the alley behind his building, doused them with
turpentine, and burned them.

Then he started over. His new work was -- Frank saw it when
Alvarado brought a canvas to the pharmacy, wanting to show someone,
anyone, what he had made -- a painting of a human face. Just a face.
But the face contained an emotional complexity that Frank had never
seen in any work of art: rage and tenderness and fear and joy and
something that was not any of those things but was all of them
simultaneously, the full spectrum of human feeling compressed into
two eyes and a mouth, and looking at it, Frank felt the window
in his chest crack open.


                               V.

He expanded the program. Cautiously at first -- five more patients,
then ten, then twenty. He selected carefully, choosing patients he
knew, patients he trusted, patients who had shown, in small ways,
the signs of an emotional life that the Bureau's medication could
suppress but not entirely eliminate. A teacher who lingered too long
over a sunset. A mechanic who talked about music. A mother who
held her child a beat too long at the drop-off. Small rebellions of
the heart, invisible to the Bureau's monitoring systems, but visible
to a pharmacist who knew what to look for because he had learned,
in one night of unmedicated darkness, what the heart was capable of.

The effects rippled through Zone 7 like a stone dropped in still
water.

People began talking to each other. Not the polite, calibrated
exchanges that the Bureau's social guidelines encouraged -- pleasant
greetings, functional inquiries, approved topics -- but real
conversations, the kind that started somewhere expected and went
somewhere no one had planned. Arguments broke out -- not the
dangerous, violent confrontations the Bureau had been created to
prevent, but passionate disagreements about art, about music, about
the proper color for a building or the best way to cook an egg.
People raised their voices. People laughed too loudly. People cried
in public.

A couple in Block 7 -- both on Frank's adjusted regimen -- fell in
love. Not the approved marital affection that the Bureau sanctioned,
but the terrifying, irrational, all-consuming variety that the
Bureau's literature described as "a leading indicator of emotional
dysregulation." They were seen walking hand in hand in the park,
oblivious to the schedule, oblivious to the monitoring, oblivious
to everything except each other.

A man in Block 12 -- Thomas Cho, as it happened -- got in a
fistfight with his supervisor at the repair shop, over a matter so
trivial that both parties would later be unable to remember what
it had been about. The fight was brief, inept, and deeply
satisfying to both participants, who shook hands afterward and went
out for drinks -- real drinks, not the Bureau-approved low-affect
beverages -- and talked until closing time about things they had
never talked about before.

Art appeared. Not Bureau-approved art -- wild, raw, emotionally
unregulated art, painted on walls and fences and the sides of
buildings, art that was ugly and beautiful and angry and joyful
and, above all, felt. Music filled the apartments of Block 9, not
just Cho's guitar but others -- a violin, a drum, voices singing
songs that no one had written down because the Bureau's cultural
division had not approved them, songs that emerged from somewhere
deeper than policy.

And a woman in Block 14 -- Mrs. Sandra Kowalski, a forty-one-year-
old accountant, divorced, living alone -- went to her apartment
after a day in which she had, for the first time in her adult life,
felt the full weight of her loneliness, and she took every pill in
her medicine cabinet -- not the mood stabilizers, which were
dispensed through the Bureau's system, but the physical medications,
the pain relievers and cold remedies and sleep aids that were still
distributed through conventional pharmacies -- and she died.

Frank heard about it from Helen, who heard about it from a neighbor.
He was in the pharmacy, filling prescriptions, and Helen called on
the building's communication system, and her voice -- still
medicated, still calm, still within the approved parameters --
delivered the news with the measured, appropriate concern that the
Bureau's compound permitted in response to a neighbor's death.

"Isn't that sad," Helen said. "She seemed like a nice woman."

Frank set down the cartridge he was filling. His hands were shaking.
His medication -- still at the Bureau's level, because he had not
adjusted his own dosage after that first night, afraid of what he
might feel -- was struggling to contain what was happening inside
him. The window was cracking. The pressure was enormous.

Sandra Kowalski was dead. She was dead because Frank had adjusted
her medication, and the loneliness that the Bureau's compound had
suppressed for years had come flooding back, and it had been too
much, too fast, too real.

He had given her feeling. And feeling had killed her.


                              VI.

The Bureau found him three weeks later.

Not through any sophisticated investigation -- Frank had not been
particularly careful, because carelessness was, he now understood,
another symptom of the emotional expansion he had experienced. The
Bureau found him through the dispensers. A routine quality-control
audit flagged the concentration discrepancies in twenty-seven
cartridges, all from Zone 7, all from Frank's pharmacy. The Bureau
investigator -- a young woman with the flat, unreadable face of
someone whose medication was calibrated for professional detachment
-- arrived on a Monday morning and presented Frank with the audit
report.

"These cartridges are under-dosed," she said. "By approximately
thirty-eight percent across all compounds. Can you explain the
discrepancy?"

Frank could. He explained it. He sat in his pharmacy, surrounded
by the tools of twenty-two years of unquestioning service, and he
told the investigator everything: the broken dispenser, the
analysis, the therapeutic ranges, the Bureau's excessive dosages,
the adjustments, the effects, Mrs. Ortega's painting, Cho's
music, Alvarado's art, the couple in the park, the fistfight, the
laughter, the arguments, the wild, unregulated, beautiful, terrible
eruption of human feeling in Zone 7.

And Sandra Kowalski. He told her about Sandra Kowalski.

The investigator listened with the patience of a person for whom
patience was a pharmaceutical product. When Frank finished, she
asked a single question.

"Do you believe what you did was justified?"

Frank thought about it. He thought about Mrs. Ortega's watercolor
sunset. He thought about Cho's music through the walls. He thought
about Alvarado's face, the painting that contained every human
emotion simultaneously. He thought about the couple in the park,
holding hands with the desperate intensity of people who had
discovered love and knew it could be taken away.

And he thought about Sandra Kowalski, alone in her apartment, feeling
the full weight of her loneliness for the first time in decades,
and finding that weight unbearable.

"I think," Frank said carefully, "that the Bureau's medication
doesn't create peace. It creates absence. The absence of violence,
yes. But also the absence of love. The absence of art. The absence
of the full range of human experience that makes life -- " He
searched for the word. "That makes life life."

"People died under the old system," the investigator said. "Wars.
Murders. Millions of people, killed by unregulated emotion."

"I know. And a woman died under mine. One woman. Killed by the
loneliness she was never allowed to feel and never given the chance
to address. Under the Bureau's system, she would have lived. She
would have lived a long, stable, productive, content life in which
she never once felt the full weight of her own existence. Is that
life? Is that what we're preserving?"

"It is what the Bureau was created to preserve."

"Then the Bureau is wrong."

The investigator wrote something in her file. Frank could not see
what it was. Her face remained flat, unreadable, professionally
detached.

"Mr. Kozlowski, you will be charged with unauthorized modification
of Bureau-controlled medications. Your pharmacy license will be
revoked. The affected patients will be re-calibrated to Bureau-
specified levels."

"They'll lose everything. The art. The music. The feelings."

"They'll be restored to stability."

"They were never unstable. They were alive."

The investigator closed her file. She stood up. At the door, she
paused -- a pause so brief that Frank almost missed it, so subtle
that it could have been a momentary hesitation in her neural
processing, a synaptic hiccup, a glitch in the Bureau's calibration.

But it wasn't. It was a pause. A human pause. The kind of pause
that happened when something inside a person pressed against a
window.

"The Bureau will send someone to collect the modified cartridges,"
she said. "Please have them ready."

She left. Frank sat in his pharmacy, in the silence that followed,
and he felt -- fully, completely, without modulation or attenuation
or the merciful dampening of the Bureau's compound -- the weight of
what he had done. The beauty of it and the horror of it. The
paintings and the music and the love and the fistfight and the
laughter and Sandra Kowalski dead on her apartment floor.

All of it. Every feeling. Every consequence. The full, unmedicated
spectrum.

He did not reach for his dispenser. He sat with it. He let it
be what it was.

Outside, through the pharmacy window, the light was coming through
the way it always did, the ordinary light of an ordinary morning
in Zone 7. And it was, Frank thought -- it was beautiful. It was
terrible. It was more than he could bear and exactly what he needed.

It was real.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       LIBRARIAN OF RUINS

                        by Oscar Lennox

================================================================================

                               I.

In the timeline where the missiles flew, October ended differently.

The specifics are well documented in what remains of the historical
record, which is to say they are documented in the fragments that
Margaret Paulson has been able to salvage, preserve, and organize
in the stone building on Elm Street that used to be the Concord
Public Library and is now, twelve years after the Exchange, the
most important institution in what remains of southern New Hampshire.

The divergence point -- Lennox's term, borrowed from his own
academic work, though Margaret would not have known the term and
would not have cared for it if she had -- occurred at 11:47 AM
Eastern Standard Time on October 27, 1962. In our timeline, a
Soviet submarine commander named Vasili Arkhipov refused to
authorize a nuclear torpedo launch against the American destroyer
that was depth-charging his vessel. In Margaret's timeline, Arkhipov
was not aboard the submarine. He had been transferred to shore duty
three weeks earlier, the result of a personnel decision so minor
that no one noticed it at the time, and the officer who replaced
him did not refuse. The torpedo was launched. The destroyer was
destroyed. The escalation that followed consumed eleven days and
approximately four hundred million lives.

Margaret Paulson does not know any of this. She does not know about
Arkhipov or the torpedo or the divergence point. She knows only that
in October of 1962, when she was twenty-four years old and working
as an assistant librarian at the Concord Public Library, the world
ended, and that she survived, and that the books survived -- some
of them -- and that in the twelve years since, the preservation of
those books has become the purpose around which she has organized
her life, her community, and her understanding of what it means to
be human in the aftermath of what humans have done.

The library stands. Not intact -- the north wall collapsed in the
third winter, and Margaret's people rebuilt it with stones salvaged
from the ruins of the post office, so that the building is now a
hybrid of its original architecture and the rougher, more pragmatic
construction that characterizes everything built after the Exchange.
The windows are gone, replaced by oiled cloth that admits a diffuse,
amber light in which the surviving books -- 4,217 of them, by
Margaret's last count, each one catalogued in the leather-bound
ledger she keeps at the front desk -- are visible on their shelves
like rows of patient, waiting faces.

It is November 1974 in the timeline where the missiles flew.
Margaret is thirty-six years old. Her hair, which was brown, is
now streaked with gray, an aging accelerated by twelve years of
inadequate nutrition, chronic low-level radiation exposure, and the
particular kind of exhaustion that comes from carrying a
civilization's memory on your back. She wears a heavy wool coat --
the winters are colder now, the dust in the upper atmosphere
reflecting sunlight in ways that the surviving meteorologists, of
whom there are two in the region, cannot precisely predict -- and
she is standing at the front desk of the library, cataloguing a
new acquisition.

The book is a copy of "Gray's Anatomy." It was found by a scavenging
party in the ruins of a doctor's office in Manchester, twenty miles
south, a journey that took three days on foot because the roads are
impassable and the horses, which are the primary means of
transportation in the post-Exchange world, are too valuable to risk
on a scavenging run. The book is water-damaged, smoke-stained, and
missing its last forty pages. It is also, Margaret believes, the
most important acquisition the library has made in six months.

She opens the ledger and writes, in the careful, precise handwriting
that she maintains as a matter of professional discipline:

4,218. Gray's Anatomy, 20th edition, 1918. Lea & Febiger,
Philadelphia. Acquired 11/14/74, Manchester salvage.
Condition: fair. Water damage throughout, smoke damage
to cover and first 30 pages, pp. 1,397-1,436 missing.
Contains complete sections on musculoskeletal system,
circulatory system, and nervous system. Of critical
medical reference value.

She closes the ledger and places the book on the shelf designated
MEDICAL REFERENCE, which contains eleven other volumes, none of
them complete, all of them invaluable. In the pre-Exchange world,
a twenty-year-old edition of Gray's Anatomy would have been a
curiosity, a collector's item at best. In this world, it is the
difference between a doctor who can set a compound fracture
correctly and one who cannot, between a midwife who understands
the complications of breech birth and one who is guessing.

Knowledge, in the ruins, has a weight it never had before. Every
book is a life preserver. Every lost page is a life that might
not be saved.


                              II.

The Council met on Tuesdays in the basement of the Congregational
church, which was the largest intact interior space in Concord and
which served as meeting hall, courtroom, and, in the deepest cold
of winter, communal shelter. The Council comprised seven members,
elected by the 340 residents of the Concord settlement, and it
governed by consensus when possible and by majority vote when
necessary, which was increasingly often.

Margaret attended every Council meeting, not as a member -- she had
declined nomination twice, on the grounds that the library required
her full attention -- but as what the Council called the Community
Librarian, a title she had not asked for but which carried, in the
post-Exchange world, a significance that would have astonished her
pre-Exchange self. The librarian was the keeper of the knowledge.
In a world where printing presses had been destroyed, where paper
was scarce, where the accumulated information of human civilization
existed only in whatever books had survived the fires and the
fallout and the desperate first years when people burned books for
warmth because they did not yet understand what they were losing,
the librarian was essential.

Tonight's meeting concerned the library directly.

"The question before the Council," said Harold Bergstrom, the
Council chairman -- a former insurance adjuster who had discovered,
in the aftermath of everything, a talent for governance that his
previous career had given him no opportunity to exercise -- "is the
allocation of community resources to the preservation of library
materials. Margaret?"

Margaret stood. She was not a natural public speaker -- she was a
librarian, trained in the art of quiet assistance, of helping people
find what they needed without inserting herself into the finding --
but twelve years of advocacy for the library had taught her to
present her case with a directness that her pre-Exchange self would
not have recognized.

"The library currently holds 4,218 volumes. Of these, approximately
1,200 are in good condition. The remaining 3,000 are deteriorating
due to water damage, insect damage, and the effects of twelve years
of storage in a building that is not climate-controlled. Without
intervention, I estimate that we will lose 500 volumes in the next
two years and another 800 in the five years after that."

"What kind of intervention?" Bergstrom asked.

"Rebinding. Deacidification. Controlled storage conditions. I need
materials -- leather for binding, the chemical compounds for
deacidification, which Dr. Petrov tells me he can synthesize from
available materials if given time and resources. And I need labor.
At least two full-time assistants."

The Council members exchanged glances. Resources, in the Concord
settlement, were allocated with the care of a surgeon distributing
blood during a transfusion. Every person-hour dedicated to the
library was a person-hour not dedicated to farming, construction,
medical care, or the dozen other activities that kept 340 people
alive through the New Hampshire winter.

"Margaret," said Eleanor Voss, the Council member responsible for
agricultural planning, a lean, sunburned woman who had been a
high school biology teacher before the Exchange and was now the
settlement's most important food producer. "I want to support the
library. I believe in what you're doing. But we have 340 mouths to
feed, and last year's harvest was short by twelve percent. I need
every hand I can get in the fields this spring."

"I understand, Eleanor. But the knowledge in those books is what
allows you to farm effectively. The agricultural manuals, the soil
chemistry references, the entomology texts -- you've used them
yourself."

"I have. And I'm not suggesting we abandon the library. I'm
suggesting we prioritize. Which books do we save? The medical
references, the agricultural guides, the engineering manuals --
the books that keep us alive. Those, yes, by all means. But the
others --"

"The others?"

"The novels. The poetry. The history books. The philosophy." Eleanor
spread her hands, a gesture that encompassed the vast, impractical
expanse of human culture. "We're fighting for survival, Margaret.
We can't afford to preserve luxuries."

The word struck Margaret like a physical blow. Luxuries. She heard
it and felt, beneath the surface of her professional composure, a
reaction she could not immediately name but which partook of grief,
anger, and a fierce, protective love for the objects in her care.

"They're not luxuries," she said. "They're the reason we're
fighting for survival in the first place."

"Explain."

"A civilization is not a collection of practical skills. It's a --"
She paused, reaching for the right word, and found it where she
always found the right words: in the books. "It's a story. A story
we tell ourselves about who we are and what we value and what kind
of life is worth living. The medical books tell us how to keep our
bodies alive. The novels and the poetry and the philosophy tell us
why. Without the why, the how is meaningless."

The Council debated. The debate was civil but intense, and it
revealed a division that Margaret had sensed for months but had
hoped would not crystallize into formal opposition: the division
between those who saw the library as a tool for survival and those
who saw it as a threat.

The threat argument was made, with surprising eloquence, by a man
named Robert Hale.

Hale was a newcomer -- he had arrived in Concord three months ago,
leading a group of twelve survivors from the south, people who had
spent the post-Exchange years in a series of smaller, more desperate
settlements. He was forty, hard-faced, with the economical movements
and watchful eyes of a man who had learned to assess threats quickly.
He had been elected to the Council one week after his arrival, a
sign of both his natural authority and the settlement's need for
people who could make hard decisions.

"I've seen what happens when people learn too much about the old
world," Hale said. He did not raise his voice; he did not need to.
His voice had the quiet authority of a man who had been listened to
in circumstances where not listening meant dying. "In the settlements
I've come from, we had people who couldn't stop talking about what
things used to be like. How the lights used to work. How the water
used to come out of a faucet. How you could get on a machine and
fly through the air to the other side of the world. And every time
they talked about it, the people who listened got a little more
hopeless. Because the more you know about what you've lost, the
less you can bear what you have."

He looked at Margaret with an expression that was not hostile but
was very, very serious.

"Your books are beautiful, Mrs. Paulson. And some of them are
useful. But some of them are poison. A novel about life before the
Exchange is a window into a world we can never get back to. An
encyclopedia full of technologies we can never rebuild is a catalog
of our own inadequacy. A history book that explains how this happened
-- how the decisions were made, how the warnings were ignored, how
the men who were supposed to protect us chose to destroy us instead --
is a document of rage. And rage, Mrs. Paulson, is something this
settlement cannot afford."

The room was very quiet. Margaret could hear the wind outside, the
sound of the post-Exchange world -- colder, quieter, emptier than
the one that had produced the books on her shelves.

"Mr. Hale," she said. "You're describing censorship."

"I'm describing survival."

"They're not the same thing."

"In the world we live in, they may be. I'm not proposing we burn
the books. I'm proposing we restrict access. The useful books --
the medical references, the farming guides, the technical manuals --
should be available to everyone. The others should be stored, safely,
and accessed only by people who have a demonstrated need."

"And who decides what constitutes a demonstrated need?"

"The Council. As it decides every other allocation of resources."

Margaret looked around the room. She could see the Council members
weighing the arguments -- not casually, not carelessly, but with
the earnest, exhausted deliberation of people who made life-and-
death decisions every week and were weary of the weight. She could
see the appeal of Hale's argument. It was practical. It was
reasonable. It addressed a real problem -- the psychological damage
of nostalgia, the corrosive effect of knowing what you had lost --
with a practical solution.

And it was, she knew with the certainty of a woman who had spent
twelve years in the company of books, wrong.


                             III.

The vote was four to three, in favor of Hale's proposal. The library
would be divided. Useful books would remain accessible. The rest
would be moved to restricted storage, available only by Council
authorization.

Margaret accepted the vote. She did not accept the premise.

She spent the next three days cataloguing the collection according
to the Council's new categories. ACCESSIBLE: medical references,
agricultural manuals, engineering texts, survival guides, first-aid
handbooks, veterinary guides, basic chemistry and physics textbooks.
RESTRICTED: novels, poetry, philosophy, history, biography,
mathematics beyond the practical, science beyond the applicable,
art, music theory, literary criticism, political theory.

The division was, she discovered, roughly equal: 2,100 useful books,
2,118 luxuries. The numbers had a symmetry that felt like a
commentary.

She placed the restricted books in the library's back room -- a
windowless space that had, before the Exchange, been used for
overflow storage and staff meetings. She shelved them carefully,
in the same order they had occupied on the public shelves, and she
catalogued each one in a separate ledger that she kept in her desk
drawer, next to the master catalogue.

And then she did what librarians have done throughout history when
confronted with the restriction of knowledge: she subverted the
restriction, quietly, carefully, and with the professional expertise
that twenty-four years of library work -- twelve before the Exchange
and twelve after -- had given her.

She did not defy the Council openly. She did not make speeches or
organize protests or appeal the vote. She simply made the restricted
books available to anyone who asked, through the simple mechanism
of personal recommendation.

When Thomas Petrov, the settlement's doctor, came in for a medical
reference, she said, as she handed him the battered copy of "Gray's
Anatomy": "You might also be interested in this." And she gave him
a copy of Chekhov's short stories, because Petrov was Russian by
ancestry and because Chekhov had been a doctor and because the
stories -- "Ward No. 6," "The Lady with the Dog," "Gooseberries" --
contained truths about human suffering and human dignity that no
medical textbook could convey.

When Eleanor Voss came in for the agricultural references she used
every planting season, Margaret added a copy of Thoreau's "Walden"
to the stack, because Thoreau had written about self-sufficiency
and the relationship between a person and the land they worked, and
because Eleanor, for all her practicality, had the soul of a
philosopher -- Margaret had seen it in the way she looked at her
fields, with an attention that exceeded agricultural assessment
and entered the territory of love.

When the settlement's children came for their weekly reading lesson --
Margaret taught reading three afternoons a week, using the
accessible books as texts -- she supplemented the approved materials
with stories. Not technical stories, not survival stories, but
the kind of stories that the Council had decided were luxuries:
"The Adventures of Tom Sawyer," "The Secret Garden," "A Wrinkle
in Time." Stories about worlds that did not exist anymore but whose
values -- courage, curiosity, kindness, the belief that the world
could be understood and improved -- were exactly what these children,
growing up in the ruins, most needed to encounter.

She was not caught. Or rather, she was caught immediately and
continually, because the Council members were not stupid and the
settlement was too small for secrets, but the enforcement of the
restriction would have required a degree of authoritarianism that
even Hale was unwilling to impose. The restricted books circulated,
passed from hand to hand, read in the evenings by lamplight -- oil
lamps, because electricity was a memory and a hope but not yet a
reality -- and the effect was not the despair that Hale had
predicted but something else: a kind of nourishment that Margaret
could see in the faces of her readers, a filling-out of the spirit
that paralleled the filling-out of the body when a starving person
is given food.

Not everyone responded well. Hale was right about that. There were
people who read the histories and the descriptions of pre-Exchange
life and were consumed by a bitterness that served no purpose, a
rage at the men who had launched the missiles that found no outlet
in a world where there was no one to punish and nothing to be done.
There was a man -- James Whitfield, a former accountant -- who read
a book about the Kennedy administration and did not speak for a week
afterward, and when he did speak, it was to say, with a quiet fury
that frightened his neighbors, "They knew. They knew it could
happen. They had war games, simulations, reports. They knew what the
missiles would do, and they built them anyway."

Margaret did not dismiss this reaction. She did not tell Whitfield
that his rage was inappropriate or unproductive. She sat with him
in the library, in the amber light that came through the oiled-cloth
windows, and she listened, because listening was what librarians
did, and because rage, like every other human emotion, needed to be
witnessed before it could be processed.

Then she gave him another book. Marcus Aurelius, "Meditations." Not
because the Stoic philosophy would cure his rage -- nothing would
cure it; the rage was appropriate -- but because Marcus Aurelius had
written about how to live in a world that was falling apart, about
the discipline of mind that allowed a person to acknowledge the
worst without being destroyed by it, and Whitfield needed that
discipline the way a man with a broken leg needed a splint.

Whitfield read the "Meditations." He read it twice. Then he came
back to the library and asked for more.

"More philosophy?"

"More anything. Something that tells me how to live in this. Not
how to survive. I know how to survive. How to live."

Margaret gave him Thoreau. She gave him Montaigne. She gave him
Emily Dickinson, because Dickinson had written about death and
isolation and the fierce, indestructible persistence of the mind,
and because the poems were short enough to be memorized, which
Whitfield did, walking around the settlement with Dickinson's
words in his head like a private liturgy.

The rage did not disappear. But it was joined by something else --
a framework, a context, a language for the experience of being
human in impossible circumstances. The books did not make the ruins
bearable. They made the experience of the ruins articulable, which
was different and, Margaret believed, more important. To name your
suffering was not to end it but to own it, and ownership was the
beginning of agency, and agency was the beginning of everything.


                              IV.

Robert Hale came to the library on a Thursday evening in December.

It was after hours -- Margaret kept the library open from dawn to
dusk, six days a week -- but the door was never locked, because
in the post-Exchange world, locks implied a kind of suspicion that
Margaret refused to endorse, and because the books were safer in a
building that people felt free to enter than in one they might be
tempted to break into.

She was at her desk, cataloguing by lamplight. Hale entered quietly,
closing the door behind him with the careful, minimal motion of a
man who had learned to move without drawing attention. He stood in
the doorway for a moment, looking at the shelves -- the accessible
shelves in the main room, the door to the restricted room visible
but closed.

"Mrs. Paulson."

"Mr. Hale."

"I know what you've been doing."

"I know you know."

He sat down across from her desk. In the lamplight, his hard face
looked older than forty -- the kind of aging that was common in the
post-Exchange world, where forty meant sixty and sixty meant dead.
His eyes, which were usually watchful and assessing, were tonight
something else. Tired. Uncertain. Human.

"My daughter asked me about the ocean," he said.

"The ocean?"

"She's seven. She was born after the Exchange. She's never seen the
ocean. She doesn't know what it looks like, what it sounds like,
what it smells like. Someone -- I assume one of your reading students
-- told her about it. Described it from a book. And now she wants
to know everything. What are the waves? Why is it salty? Are there
really animals that live in it? She asked me if we could go see it."

Margaret waited.

"The ocean is two hundred miles from here. The roads are impassable.
The coast is -- well, you've heard the reports. Radiation levels,
contamination, the cities. We can't go to the ocean. She can't
see it. Not in her lifetime, probably. And she knows that now,
because I told her, because I believe in telling children the truth.
And the truth is that the ocean exists and she can't get to it,
and that knowledge is --" He stopped. His hands, resting on
Margaret's desk, were not still. They were clenching and unclenching,
a rhythmic contraction that Margaret recognized as the physical
expression of an emotion being processed without the language to
name it.

"I told you the books were poison," he said. "And they are. My
daughter is heartbroken about an ocean she's never seen, and the
heartbreak came from a book. You gave that to her."

"Someone gave it to her. Not me directly. But yes. Through the
library. Through the act of preservation that I believe is the
most important thing this community does."

"More important than food? Than shelter? Than survival?"

"Equal to them. Mr. Hale, your daughter is heartbroken. I'm sorry
for that. Heartbreak is painful. But your daughter also knows that
the ocean exists. She knows that the world is larger than this
settlement, larger than the fields and the ruins and the gray sky.
She knows that there is beauty in the world -- beauty she cannot
reach yet, but beauty that exists, that is real, that is waiting.
And that knowledge, Mr. Hale -- the knowledge that there is more
than this -- is the difference between a child who survives and a
child who lives."

Hale was quiet for a long time. The lamp flickered. Outside, the
December wind blew, carrying the faint, metallic smell that the
upper atmosphere still produced on certain nights, a reminder that
the dust was still up there, twelve years later, the dust of
cities and people and everything that had been.

"You've been giving out the restricted books," he said.

"Yes."

"To everyone who asks."

"Yes."

"In defiance of the Council's decision."

"In fulfillment of my duty as a librarian, which predates the
Council and will, I hope, outlast it."

Hale looked at her. She looked back. Two people, in a ruined library,
in a ruined world, arguing about the value of books. It was, Margaret
thought, one of the most important conversations she had ever had.

"My daughter wants a book about the ocean," Hale said. "Do you have
one?"

Margaret got up from her desk. She went to the restricted room,
opened the door, and found, on the third shelf from the top, a copy
of Rachel Carson's "The Sea Around Us." It was water-damaged, of
course -- everything was water-damaged -- but intact. She brought it
to Hale and placed it on the desk.

"This was written by a scientist," she said. "A woman who loved the
ocean the way you love your daughter. She described it so that people
who had never seen it could understand it, and people who had seen
it could understand it better. She wrote it because she believed
that knowledge was not a luxury but a necessity, and that the world
was worth understanding even when -- especially when -- understanding
it was painful."

Hale picked up the book. He held it the way the scavenging parties
held things they found in the ruins -- carefully, as though it
might be fragile or might be dangerous, and with the particular
respect that people in the post-Exchange world gave to objects from
the time before.

"I'll bring it back," he said.

"I know you will."

He left. Margaret sat at her desk and listened to his footsteps
on the stone floor, receding through the library, past the shelves
of useful books and the closed door behind which the luxuries
waited, and out into the December night.

She opened her ledger and wrote:

4,218. Gray's Anatomy. Still in medical reference.
Carson, Rachel. "The Sea Around Us." Loaned to R. Hale.
Due date: when he's finished.

She closed the ledger. She turned down the lamp. The library settled
into darkness -- the patient, occupied darkness of a room full of
books, each one a voice from a world that had been destroyed,
waiting to speak to the world that was being built from its ruins.

Margaret Paulson, Librarian of Concord, went home through the cold
December night, past the rebuilt walls and the salvaged stone and
the gardens that Eleanor Voss was already planning for spring, and
she thought about the ocean. She had seen it once, as a girl, on
a family trip to Maine. She remembered the sound of it -- the
rhythmic, inexhaustible sound of water meeting shore, repeating
itself without repetition, the same and different every time, the
way a story was the same and different every time it was told.

The ocean was still there. Contaminated, perhaps. Changed, certainly.
But still there, still making its sound, still meeting the shore
in the way it had been meeting the shore for four billion years,
indifferent to missiles and fallout and the small, terrible
decisions of men in rooms.

The books were still there too. Damaged, incomplete, 4,218 survivors
out of the millions that had existed. But still there. Still
speaking. Still offering, to anyone who opened them, the accumulated
wisdom and beauty and folly and grief of a civilization that had
destroyed itself but had also, in the midst of its destruction,
produced Chekhov and Dickinson and Rachel Carson and Marcus Aurelius
and all the rest of them, the chorus of voices that said: we were
here, and this is what we learned, and it matters, even now, even
in the ruins, even at the end.

Especially at the end.

                            [THE END]

                       FREQUENCY OF MERCY

                               I.

She could feel them thinking.

That was the worst part -- not the content of the thoughts, which
was often exactly as terrible as you would expect from men who had
done what these men had done, but the texture of the thinking
itself, the way it felt inside her when she opened herself to
another mind. Each consciousness had its own quality, its own
frequency, the way each voice has its own timbre even when speaking
the same words. And the frequency of these men -- the nineteen
defendants in the war-crimes tribunal of the Confederated Provinces
-- was something Lena Voss had not been prepared for, despite
thirty-seven years of telepathy, despite a career spent inside
other people's heads, despite every clinical protocol and
psychological defense she had been trained to employ.

The frequency was not what she had expected. She had expected
monstrosity. She had expected minds that were dark all the way
down, consciousnesses shaped entirely by cruelty, without light,
without doubt, without the interior hesitations that characterized
the minds of people who had not committed atrocities. She had
expected, if she was honest, to find that the men in the defendant's
dock were fundamentally different from the men outside it -- that
the capacity for mass killing required a particular kind of mind,
a mind that a telepath could identify and classify and, having
classified, set apart from the category of the human.

That was not what she found.

What she found was worse.


                              II.

The tribunal had been convened in the city of New Geneva, in the
glass-walled chamber that the Confederated Provinces had built
specifically for this purpose: a room designed for the administration
of justice at a scale that justice had never previously been asked
to accommodate. The Vostok Campaigns had lasted three years and had
produced, according to the Investigative Commission's preliminary
report, approximately 1.2 million civilian deaths, 340,000
documented cases of torture, and the systematic destruction of four
planetary colonies. The nineteen defendants were not the only
perpetrators -- thousands had participated -- but they were the
senior commanders, the decision-makers, the men whose orders had
set the machinery in motion.

Lena's role was specific and unprecedented. She was the tribunal's
Cognitive Witness -- a telepath authorized by the court to enter the
defendants' minds and testify to the court about what she found
there. The technology was reliable -- telepathic testimony had been
admitted in civil and criminal proceedings for fifteen years -- but
it had never been used at this scale, in proceedings of this
gravity, for purposes of this moral complexity.

The legal question was straightforward: could Lena determine, through
direct telepathic observation, the defendants' mental states at the
time they issued the orders that resulted in mass atrocity? Were
they aware of the consequences? Did they intend the harm? Were there
mitigating psychological factors -- coercion, delusion, diminished
capacity -- that might affect the court's judgment?

The moral question was not straightforward at all.

Lena prepared for each session the way she had been trained to
prepare: meditation, psychological fortification, the deliberate
construction of the interior barriers that protected a telepath's
own psyche from contamination by the minds she entered. Her
therapist -- Dr. Samuel Osei, himself a former telepath who had
retired after a session that he would not discuss -- met with her
before and after each reading, monitoring her mental health with
the attention of a man who knew exactly what was at stake.

"You don't have to do this," Samuel said before the first session.
They were in the small room adjacent to the tribunal chamber, a
room that smelled of institutional coffee and anxiety. "The court
can proceed without telepathic testimony. The documentary evidence
is substantial."

"The court asked for me specifically."

"The court asked for a telepath. You volunteered."

"Because I'm the best. You know that. If anyone can do this
accurately and survive it psychologically intact, it's me."

"The word 'intact' is doing a lot of work in that sentence, Lena."

She smiled. It was a thin smile, the kind that covered fear rather
than expressing amusement, but it was real. "I'll be careful."

"Being careful is not the same as being safe. You're going to enter
the minds of men who committed atrocities. You're going to
experience their memories from the inside. Not as an observer --
as a participant. That's what telepathy does. You won't be watching
what they did. You'll be feeling what they felt while they did it.
And I am telling you, from experience, that what they felt will not
be what you expect."

"What did you feel? When you --"

Samuel held up a hand. "I don't discuss that. You know I don't.
What I will tell you is this: the hardest thing about reading a
perpetrator's mind is not the cruelty. It's the humanity. The
cruelty you can prepare for. The humanity catches you off guard."

Lena did not fully understand what he meant. She would, by the end
of the third session.


                             III.

The first defendant was Commander Anton Rieve, who had ordered the
orbital bombardment of the colony on Vostok-3, resulting in
approximately 200,000 civilian deaths.

The tribunal chamber was silent. The judges -- seven of them, from
seven different provinces -- sat behind their elevated bench, their
faces professionally neutral. The prosecution and defense counsels
sat at their respective tables. The public gallery was full, the
faces a mosaic of attention, anger, grief, and the particular
hunger that people bring to proceedings where justice is being
attempted for crimes that exceed the capacity of justice to redress.

Rieve sat in the defendant's dock, a glass-walled enclosure designed
to permit telepathic contact while maintaining physical security.
He was fifty-three, lean, with the erect posture and cropped hair
of a career military officer. His face was composed. His hands were
still. He had the bearing of a man who had accepted his situation
and was determined to meet it with the dignity that his uniform,
which he had not been permitted to wear, had once conferred.

Lena sat in the Cognitive Witness chair, three meters from the dock.
She closed her eyes. She opened her mind.

Rieve's consciousness entered hers like water filling a vessel -- not
violently, not with the forced intrusion that untrained minds
sometimes experienced during telepathic contact, but with the
controlled, measured flow of a disciplined mind accustomed to order.
His thoughts were organized, his memories filed with military
precision, his emotional landscape -- and here was the first
surprise -- not the barren wasteland Lena had anticipated but a
terrain of considerable complexity, with peaks and valleys, areas
of dense activity and areas of stillness, a geography that was
recognizably, unmistakably human.

She navigated to the memory the prosecution had specified: the
morning of the bombardment order, fourteen months ago, in the
command center of the assault ship Retribution.

She was inside it now. Not watching -- being. She was Rieve, standing
at the tactical display, looking at the holographic representation
of Vostok-3 rotating slowly in blue light, the colony's population
centers marked in green, the military targets marked in red. She
felt his heartbeat -- elevated, controlled. She felt his breathing
-- shallow, disciplined. She felt his thoughts, the chain of
reasoning that led from intelligence assessment to tactical
evaluation to the decision:

The colony is sheltering enemy forces. The enemy forces are
integrated with the civilian population. Surgical strikes have
failed. The campaign timeline requires resolution of the Vostok-3
situation within seventy-two hours. The only option that meets the
timeline is general bombardment.

The reasoning was cold. Precise. Military. It moved from premise to
conclusion with the logical inevitability of a mathematical proof,
each step following from the last with an efficiency that left no
room for doubt.

Except.

There. In the space between the tactical assessment and the order
itself. In the fraction of a second that separated the decision
from its execution. Lena felt it: a flicker, a tremor, a moment of
something that disrupted the smooth, cold surface of Rieve's
reasoning like a stone dropped into still water.

Hesitation.

Not doubt -- doubt implies a questioning of the conclusion, and
Rieve did not question the conclusion. Not guilt -- guilt implies a
moral judgment, and Rieve's moral framework, at that moment, was
entirely subsumed by the military framework that had shaped his
thinking for thirty years. But hesitation. A fractional pause, a
nanosecond of interior resistance, a moment when something in
Rieve -- some element of his consciousness that was not military,
not strategic, not cold -- recognized what he was about to do and
flinched.

The flinch lasted approximately two-tenths of a second. Then it was
gone, overridden by training, duty, the logic of the situation, the
pressure of the timeline, the weight of command. Rieve gave the
order. The bombardment began. Two hundred thousand people died.

But the flinch had been real. Lena had felt it. In the architecture
of Rieve's mind, in the deep structures where thought and feeling
were not yet separated, something had resisted. Something had known.

She opened her eyes. The tribunal chamber came back into focus: the
judges, the lawyers, the public gallery, the glass-walled dock
where Rieve sat with his composed face and his still hands,
containing within his organized, disciplined mind the two-tenths of
a second of hesitation that was, Lena now understood, the most
important thing she would ever be asked to testify about.


                              IV.

She read eleven more defendants over the following six weeks.

Colonel Vasek, who had commanded the ground forces that carried out
the systematic destruction of settlements on Vostok-2. In his mind:
a moment, just before the order to advance, when he imagined his
own children in the settlements he was about to destroy. The
imagination lasted 0.7 seconds. He suppressed it.

Major Orova, who had overseen the interrogation center where 1,400
prisoners were tortured. In her mind -- Orova was the only woman
among the defendants -- a recurring dream, experienced nightly
during the period of the interrogations, in which the faces of the
prisoners merged with the face of her dead sister. Orova had not
allowed the dream to affect her conduct. She had, in fact, taken
medication to suppress the dreaming. But the dream persisted, and
in its persistence, Lena read the signature of a conscience that
could be silenced but not destroyed.

Captain Lasko, the youngest defendant, who had led a unit that
massacred civilians in a market square on Vostok-4. In his mind:
chaos. The clear, cold reasoning of Rieve's consciousness was
absent; Lasko's mind was a storm of fear, adrenaline, rage, and
confusion. But in the center of the storm, Lena found a memory: a
woman in the market square, holding a child, looking directly at
Lasko in the instant before his soldiers opened fire. The woman's
face was calm. Her eyes were steady. She did not beg. She did not
run. She looked at him, and in that look, Lasko felt -- Lena felt
him feeling -- the full weight of what he was about to do, and for
one instant, one fraction of an instant, he considered stopping.

He did not stop.

In defendant after defendant, Lena found the same thing: the flicker.
The hesitation. The moment of internal resistance, varying in
duration from a fraction of a second to several seconds, varying in
intensity from a faint tremor to a full-body recoil, but present in
every mind she entered. Eleven out of eleven. And she knew, with
the certainty that telepathy conferred -- not the probabilistic
certainty of evidence and inference, but the absolute certainty of
direct experience -- that the remaining defendants would show the
same pattern.

They had all hesitated. Every one of them. In the moment before
the atrocity, something in each of them had recognized what they
were doing and had resisted. Not effectively. Not sufficiently. Not
in a way that changed the outcome. But the resistance had been real,
as real as the orders that followed it, as real as the deaths that
followed the orders.

This was what Samuel had tried to warn her about. Not the cruelty
-- the cruelty was bearable because it was expected, because it
confirmed what the world already believed about the perpetrators,
because it could be filed under the category of evil and processed
accordingly. The hesitation was unbearable because it defied
categorization. It said: these men were not monsters. They were
human beings who contained, within themselves, the recognition of
monstrousness, and chose to proceed.

The question that kept Lena awake at night, that followed her from
the tribunal chamber to her apartment to Dr. Osei's office to her
solitary walks along the canal that ran through the center of
New Geneva, was not a legal question and not a clinical question
but a moral one:

Did the hesitation matter?


                               V.

She asked Samuel.

They were in his office after the twelfth reading -- Commander Bratz,
logistics, who had organized the supply chains that enabled the
prolonged siege of Vostok-1, and in whose mind Lena had found not
a single moment of hesitation but something almost worse: a
continuous, low-level awareness of the human cost of his work,
experienced not as dramatic resistance but as a persistent background
noise that Bratz had learned to ignore the way a person learns to
ignore the hum of a refrigerator.

"They all have it," Lena said. She was sitting in the chair across
from Samuel's desk, holding a cup of tea that had gone cold. Her
hands were steady. Her voice was steady. The steadiness was
professional, maintained by the same disciplined control that had
allowed her to enter twelve perpetrators' minds without losing her
own. Underneath the steadiness, she was not steady at all. "Every
single one. The flicker. The hesitation. The moment when they knew."

Samuel nodded. His face, as always during these debriefings, was
carefully neutral, the face of a therapist who understood that his
own reactions must not contaminate his patient's processing.

"Does it matter?" Lena asked. "The hesitation. The flicker of
conscience. Does it count for anything?"

"What do you mean by 'count'?"

"I mean: does it mitigate? Does a man who hesitates for two-tenths
of a second before ordering a bombardment bear less moral
responsibility than a man who does not hesitate at all? Is the
flicker of conscience -- the recognition that what you're doing is
wrong, even if that recognition doesn't change what you do -- is
that morally significant?"

Samuel was quiet for a long time. Outside, through the office
window, the canal reflected the gray November sky, and a boat
passed slowly, carrying cargo from the eastern districts.

"You're asking two different questions," he said. "The legal
question is whether the hesitation constitutes evidence of knowledge
and intent -- whether it proves that the defendants knew their
actions were wrong, which strengthens the prosecution's case
rather than weakening it. The moral question is whether the
hesitation constitutes a form of -- what? Redemption? Mitigation?
Evidence that the perpetrator retained some connection to the moral
framework they violated?"

"Yes. That."

"I don't know. And I'm not sure it's a question that can be answered
by a telepath or a therapist. It might be a question for a
philosopher. Or a poet."

"I'm not asking a philosopher. I'm asking you."

Samuel leaned forward. His eyes, which were usually guarded behind
the professional neutrality, showed something: the edge of the
experience he would not discuss, the session that had ended his
career.

"When I was practicing," he said, carefully, "I read a man who had
done something -- I won't say what. Something terrible. And in his
mind, I found the same thing you're finding. The hesitation. The
moment of knowing. And I asked myself the same question you're
asking, and the answer I arrived at -- the answer that eventually
made me stop practicing -- was this."

He paused.

"The hesitation makes it worse."

Lena stared at him.

"A man who commits an atrocity without hesitation, without knowing,
without any interior resistance -- that man is a machine. A broken
machine, functioning according to a program that has no moral
content. He is terrible, but he is simple. You can categorize him.
You can say: here is a mind without conscience, and the absence of
conscience explains the action.

"But a man who hesitates -- a man who knows, who feels the wrongness,
who experiences the interior resistance of a functioning conscience
-- and then does it anyway -- that man is not a machine. He is a
human being making a choice. And the choice is worse because it is
made in the presence of the knowledge that it is wrong. The
conscience does not redeem the action. The conscience condemns it
more completely, because it proves that the action was not the
result of ignorance or incapacity but of a deliberate override. The
perpetrator felt the pull of mercy and chose to ignore it. The
hesitation is not the seed of redemption. It is the final proof of
culpability."

Lena sat with this. The tea was cold in her hands. The gray light
from the window fell across Samuel's desk, across the papers and
the books and the small framed photograph of a woman that Lena had
never asked about.

"But if that's true," she said, "then the conscience is just --
what? A witness? A spectator? A part of the self that watches the
other part commit the atrocity and does nothing but register its
objection?"

"Yes."

"And that witnessing has no value?"

"I didn't say that. I said it makes the crime worse. I didn't say
it has no value. It may have enormous value -- for the perpetrator,
for the species, for the long project of understanding what human
beings are capable of. The fact that conscience persists in the act
of atrocity tells us something important about the structure of the
human mind: that moral knowledge and immoral action can coexist in
the same consciousness, that knowing is not the same as doing, that
the gap between recognizing the right and choosing it is the gap in
which all of human evil occurs."

"That's not comforting."

"No. It is not."


                              VI.

On the last day of her testimony, Lena sat in the Cognitive Witness
chair and addressed the tribunal.

She had read all nineteen defendants. She had spent 114 hours inside
their minds. She had felt what they felt: the cold reasoning, the
hot fear, the adrenaline, the discipline, the ideology, the loyalty,
the ambition, and in every case, without exception, the flicker.
The hesitation. The moment of knowing.

The chief judge -- a woman named Adaora Okafor, who had presided
over the tribunal with a gravity and a patience that Lena found
both impressive and, in its steadiness, slightly terrifying -- asked
Lena to summarize her findings for the court.

Lena looked at the judges. She looked at the defendants, seated in
their glass-walled docks, nineteen men and women whose minds she
now knew more intimately than she knew her own. She looked at the
public gallery, where the faces of the survivors and the families
of the dead waited for her to say something that would make sense of
what had been done to them.

"In every defendant I examined," Lena said, "I found a functioning
moral conscience. By this I mean: a component of consciousness that
recognized the wrongness of the actions being undertaken, that
generated a resistance response -- however brief, however ineffectual
-- at the moment of decision. This conscience was not absent. It was
overridden.

"The overriding was accomplished through various psychological
mechanisms: military training, ideological conviction, obedience to
authority, diffusion of responsibility, the psychological momentum
of a situation already in motion. These mechanisms are well
documented in the literature of atrocity, and I will not dwell on
them. What I wish to report to the court is the thing that the
literature does not capture, the thing that only a telepath can
know: what the conscience felt like from the inside, in the moment
of its defeat.

"It felt like grief."

The chamber was silent. Lena heard her own breathing, heard the
faint hum of the environmental systems, heard the amplified silence
of a room full of people waiting.

"In every defendant, the moment of hesitation was accompanied by an
emotion that I can only describe as anticipatory grief. A mourning
for the person they were about to stop being. In the fraction of a
second before the conscience was overridden, each defendant
experienced a loss -- the loss of the self that would not have given
the order, the self that would have chosen differently, the self
that the hesitation represented and that the action destroyed.

"I cannot tell the court whether this grief constitutes mitigation.
That is a legal and moral judgment that exceeds my competence. What
I can tell the court, with the certainty that direct telepathic
observation provides, is that these defendants were not unfeeling.
They were not incapable of moral reasoning. They were not monsters
in the sense that the word is commonly used -- beings fundamentally
different from the rest of us, lacking the interior apparatus of
conscience that prevents most people from committing atrocities.

"They had that apparatus. It was functioning. And they overrode it.

"Whether the presence of a conscience that fails is better or worse
than the absence of a conscience that might have succeeded -- whether
the flicker of mercy in the mind of a man who chooses cruelty
redeems him or condemns him more completely -- these are questions
I cannot answer. I have felt the mercy. I have felt its frequency.
It is the same frequency that operates in every human mind I have
ever read, including my own. The same signal, at the same pitch,
saying the same thing: do not do this.

"In these defendants, the signal was heard. It was not obeyed.

"That is my testimony."


                             VII.

She walked home along the canal after the final session.

It was evening. The sky over New Geneva was the color of an old
bruise -- purple and gray and amber at the edges, the light fading
with the reluctant slowness of a late-autumn sunset. The canal water
reflected the sky and doubled it, so that Lena walked between two
darkening worlds, the real and the reflected, and felt suspended
between them in the way she often felt suspended between minds --
belonging fully to neither, seeing both.

She thought about the frequency.

In her career, she had read thousands of minds. Criminals and saints,
artists and bureaucrats, children and the dying. And in every mind,
without exception, she had found the same signal: the frequency of
conscience, the interior voice that said this is right, this is
wrong, do this, do not do this. It varied in strength. It varied in
clarity. In some minds it was a shout; in others a whisper; in a
few, the merest flicker, barely detectable, like a candle flame in
a hurricane. But it was always there.

The question she had not asked the tribunal, because it was not a
question the tribunal could answer, was the question that would
follow her for the rest of her life:

If the frequency of mercy is universal -- if it exists in every
human mind, including the minds of men who commit atrocities -- then
what is it for?

Not what does it do, because she knew what it did: nothing. Or
nothing sufficient. It hesitated. It flickered. It grieved. And
then it was overridden, and the atrocity proceeded, and the
conscience survived the action that it had failed to prevent, and
the perpetrator carried within him, for the rest of his life, the
knowledge that he had known and had not stopped.

What was it for?

Was it proof that human beings were fundamentally moral creatures
who sometimes failed? Or was it proof that human beings were
fundamentally capable of atrocity and had evolved a conscience not
to prevent the atrocity but to feel bad about it afterward -- a
psychological mechanism for guilt, which was not the same thing
as a mechanism for prevention?

Was the frequency of mercy a promise? Or was it an alibi?

Lena walked. The canal darkened. The lights of New Geneva came on,
one by one, reflected in the water, and the city looked, for a
moment, like a mirror image of itself, inverted, doubled, the same
and not the same.

She thought about Rieve and his two-tenths of a second. She thought
about Orova and her recurring dream. She thought about young Lasko
and the woman in the market square who had looked at him with calm,
steady eyes in the instant before his soldiers opened fire, and
about the part of Lasko that had wanted to stop and the part that
had not stopped and the question of which part was the real Lasko,
the one who hesitated or the one who killed.

Both. That was the answer she had arrived at, and it was the answer
she could not accept, because it meant that the capacity for mercy
and the capacity for atrocity were not opposites but neighbors,
living side by side in the same consciousness, separated by nothing
more substantial than a decision, a moment, two-tenths of a second.

The frequency of mercy was always broadcasting. In every mind she
had ever read, it was there, transmitting its signal, saying do not
do this, saying stop, saying there is another way. And in every
mind, the signal was received. And in most minds, most of the time,
it was obeyed. And in some minds, at some moments, for reasons that
ranged from ideology to fear to simple obedience, it was not.

And the signal continued anyway. That was the thing. Even after
being overridden, even after failing, even after the atrocity was
committed and the dead were dead and the perpetrator had proved,
by his actions, that the signal was insufficient -- it continued.
It went on broadcasting. Do not do this. Stop. There is another way.

A useless signal. A failed warning. A conscience that persisted in
the face of its own defeat.

Or -- and Lena paused on the bridge over the canal, stopped by a
thought that arrived not as a conclusion but as a question, the
kind of question that does not expect an answer but insists on
being asked -- or the most important thing about being human. Not
because it prevented the worst, but because it survived the worst.
Because it was still there, still broadcasting, still saying no,
even when no one was listening. Even when the listening did not
matter. Even when the mercy failed and the cruelty prevailed and
the frequency was nothing but a whisper in the wreckage.

It was still there. It was always there.

Lena stood on the bridge and looked down at the dark water and the
reflected lights and the doubled sky, and she did not know whether
the frequency of mercy redeemed the species or condemned it, and
she suspected she would never know, and she understood, finally,
that not knowing was the point. That the moral life was not a
problem to be solved but a frequency to be maintained -- a signal
transmitted into darkness, without guarantee of reception, without
assurance of effect, but transmitted nonetheless, because the
transmission itself was the thing, the only thing, the irreducible
human thing.

She walked home. She did not resolve the question. She carried it
with her, the way a telepath carries every mind she has ever
entered, the way a conscience carries every failure it has ever
witnessed, the way mercy carries the weight of every cruelty it
has failed to prevent.

The frequency continued. In the dark, on the bridge, in the tribunal,
in the minds of murderers and saints and everyone between: the
same signal, at the same pitch, broadcasting the same impossible,
necessary, undefeated word.

No.

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

COLONEL JAMES "BUCK" STANTON (RET.) spent thirty-one years in the
United States Air Force, flew P-51 Mustangs over Europe, commanded
a fighter wing in Korea, and retired to a ranch in Fredericksburg,
Texas, where he writes military science fiction with the unsparing
honesty of a man who has earned the right to it. His stories do not
celebrate war; they report it, with the precision and the gravity
of an after-action review. "Fictitious Numbers" is, by his own
admission, his most personal story -- a work drawn from experiences
he has never previously discussed in or out of fiction. We asked him
how close the story was to autobiography. His reply: "Close enough
to cost me sleep." It is his eighteenth and, we suspect, his finest
story for these pages, and it is the rawest piece of fiction we
have published. It cost us sleep too.

MARGARET THORNTON lives alone on Orcas Island in the San Juan
archipelago, where the tide pools and the old-growth forests
continue to provide the ecological sensibility that has defined
her fiction since her debut in these pages fifteen years ago. A
marine biologist by training, she writes about alien ecologies with
the precision of a scientist and the beauty of a poet, and her
work has grown steadily darker and more urgent as the environmental
movement she champions confronts the indifference she fears.
"Ecology of Fear" is her darkest story -- a meditation on a world
where terror is not the enemy of life but its engine. We asked
her if the story was a metaphor. She said: "All ecology is
metaphor. That's what makes it ecology." It is her twenty-ninth
story for "Tales," and it left us profoundly unsettled, which is
exactly what she intended.

JULIAN ST. CROIX is a Cambridge-educated novelist, literary
provocateur, and the most divisive writer on our roster. His
baroque prose, his structural daring, and his insistence that
science fiction can and must engage with the full resources of
literary modernism have divided our readers since his debut in
Issue #53, and the division shows no sign of healing. He lives in
Bloomsbury, dresses like a man who has wandered out of an Edwardian
garden party, and maintains that champagne is an essential tool of
the creative process. "Dreamers' Republic" is his most psychedelic
story and, we believe, his most moving -- a work about the
seduction of perfection and the courage required to choose the
imperfect real. He calls it "a love letter to waking up." It is
his twentieth story for "Tales."

THEODORE CAIN is the backbone of this magazine and will remain so
as long as he continues to write, which we devoutly hope will be
forever. The most prolific contributor in our history, with forty-
six stories to his name, he is a former autoworker, a Battle of
the Bulge veteran, and a man who writes every evening from eight
to midnight in a converted bedroom in Dearborn, Michigan, producing
work of quiet, consistent excellence that we have come to rely on
the way a building relies on its foundation. "Unlicensed Feeling"
is among his finest -- a story about what happens when you give
people back the emotions that a well-meaning system took away.
We asked him where the idea came from. He said: "I was watching
my wife laugh at something on television, and I thought: what if
that laugh needed a prescription?" It is his forty-sixth story
for these pages, and it proves once again that Theodore Cain is
better than he thinks he is.

OSCAR LENNOX is a professor of history at Boston University, a
scholar of counterfactual reasoning, and the finest alternate
history writer in science fiction. He lives in a cluttered apartment
in Brookline surrounded by maps, timelines, and the accumulated
evidence of roads not taken, and his fiction explores the branching
paths of possibility with the rigor of a historian and the
compassion of a novelist. "Librarian of Ruins" is his most somber
story -- a work set in a timeline where the Cuban Missile Crisis
ended in nuclear war, and where a librarian in the ruins must
defend the value of books against a community that sees knowledge
as both treasure and poison. We asked him why he wrote it. He
said: "Because I needed to remember what libraries are for. And
I suspected I was not the only one." It is his twentieth story
for "Tales."

MIRIAM BLACKWELL grew up in Greenwich Village, studied clinical
psychology at Barnard and Columbia, and writes fiction that
explores the interior landscape of consciousness with an intimacy
and a precision that no other writer in this magazine -- or any
magazine -- can match. Her stories are journeys into the spaces
between thought and feeling, between self and other, between the
mind's surface and its depths. "Frequency of Mercy" is her most
morally challenging work -- a story about a telepath who reads
the minds of war criminals and finds, in every one, the flicker
of conscience that makes their crimes not lesser but greater. It
is the story we have argued about most in the three years of this
editorial partnership, and we have not stopped arguing. It is her
seventeenth story for "Tales," and it is, we believe, a
masterpiece.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Editors,

Margaret Thornton's "Communes of Ganymede" in Issue #69 was the
finest ecological science fiction I have read since her own
"Succession." She writes about ecosystems the way other writers
write about people -- with attention, with respect, and with the
understanding that complexity is not a problem to be solved but a
condition to be honored. More Thornton, always.

                              -- Dr. Catherine Haldane
                                 Department of Ecology
                                 University of Wisconsin, Madison

Dear Dr. Haldane -- Thornton returns in this issue with "Ecology
of Fear," which we believe is her most powerful story to date.
It may also be her most disturbing. We hope you will tell us
what you think.                                            -- D.F.

Dear Mr. Sterling and Miss Foxworth,

I am a Vietnam veteran, recently returned. I want you to know that
Colonel Stanton's stories are the only fiction I can read right now.
Not because they are about war -- I have had enough of war -- but
because they are honest about war in a way that nothing else I have
encountered is honest. He writes about the confusion, the
bureaucracy, the gap between what the brass says is happening and
what is actually happening, and he does it without sentimentality
and without rage. Just truth.

I don't know if the Colonel has been to Vietnam. His stories
suggest he understands it, even if his wars are set in space.

                              -- PFC David Hernandez
                                 San Antonio, Texas

Dear Mr. Hernandez -- Welcome home. The Colonel leads this issue
with a story that we believe you will find speaks directly to your
experience. We will say no more, except: thank you for your
service, and thank you for reading.                        -- M.S.

---

Dear Editors,

I have been reading Julian St. Croix since his debut, and I want
to report that "Prismatic" has ruined me for all other fiction.
Nothing else seems adequate after the experience of reading St.
Croix at full power. Is this a compliment or a complaint? I
honestly cannot tell.

                              -- Gerald Fitzpatrick
                                 Bookseller
                                 Charing Cross Road, London

Dear Mr. Fitzpatrick -- We sympathize. St. Croix has that effect.
His new story, "Dreamers' Republic," is his most accessible work
and possibly his most beautiful. Whether this will repair the
damage to your reading life or worsen it, we cannot predict.  -- D.F.

---

Dear Editors,

Miriam Blackwell's "The Empathy Hypothesis" frightened me more
than any horror story I have ever read. The idea that genuine
empathy -- really feeling what another person feels -- might be
worse than isolation is one I cannot stop thinking about. She
writes about consciousness the way Koslov writes about physics:
as though it were the most important and most dangerous frontier
there is.

Has she written anything else? I need more.

                              -- Alice Yamamoto
                                 Graduate Student, Psychology
                                 University of California, Berkeley

Dear Miss Yamamoto -- Blackwell closes this issue with "Frequency
of Mercy," which explores the territory where empathy meets justice.
It is the most morally challenging story we have published. We
think you will find it unforgettable. We did.               -- M.S. & D.F.

---

Dear Editors,

I am a librarian, and I was moved by the mention in your last issue
of a story involving the preservation of knowledge. In these
troubled times, I find myself thinking more and more about the
fragility of the institutions we take for granted -- libraries,
universities, the free press -- and wondering whether science
fiction might have something to say about what happens when those
institutions fail.

                              -- Helen Marchand
                                 Public Library
                                 Portland, Oregon

Dear Mrs. Marchand -- Oscar Lennox has written exactly the story
you are looking for. "Librarian of Ruins," in this issue, is
about a librarian preserving books in the aftermath of nuclear
war, and it is about everything you describe: the fragility of
knowledge, the politics of preservation, and the irreplaceable
value of the work you do every day. We hope you will read it
and write to us again.                                     -- D.F.

                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

THE EINSTEIN INTERSECTION by Samuel R. Delany
(Ace Books, 1967, $0.40)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Delany continues to astonish. Following the remarkable
"Babel-17," he has produced a novel that is at once a mythic quest
narrative, a meditation on the relationship between form and
content, and the most musically written science fiction since
Bradbury's best work. The premise -- aliens inhabiting the
abandoned Earth, wearing human forms and human myths like
ill-fitting clothes -- is handled with a poetic density that
rewards every rereading.

The novel's ambition occasionally exceeds its reach: there are
passages where the symbolism becomes opaque and the narrative
threads tangle in ways that seem unintentional rather than
designed. But these are minor complaints against a work of
genuine originality by a writer who is, at twenty-five, already
one of the most important voices in the genre.

Highly recommended, with the caveat that readers who prefer their
science fiction straightforward may find the experience
disorienting. This is not a criticism. Disorientation is
sometimes the point.

CAMP CONCENTRATION by Thomas M. Disch
(Rupert Hart-Davis, 1968, 25s)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Disch has written a novel that is angry, brilliant, and
deliberately unpleasant -- a book that grabs the reader by the
collar and refuses to let go until it has said what it means to
say about war, intelligence, power, and the uses to which a
government will put its citizens when it decides that national
security outweighs human dignity.

The premise -- a conscientious objector imprisoned in a military
camp where prisoners are injected with a syphilis-derived drug
that dramatically increases intelligence while inevitably killing
the subject -- is handled with a literary sophistication that
elevates it far above the level of mere cautionary tale. The
novel's journal-entry format gives it an immediacy and an intimacy
that make the horror personal rather than abstract, and the
intelligence of the prose -- which increases in complexity as the
narrator's enhanced mind develops -- is a technical achievement of
the first order.

This is not a comfortable book. It is not meant to be. In a year
when the relationship between government power and individual
conscience is on every thinking person's mind, it is essential
reading.

LORD OF LIGHT by Roger Zelazny
(Doubleday, 1967, $4.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Mr. Zelazny's extraordinary novel -- in which the crew of a
colonization ship have established themselves as the gods of the
Hindu pantheon, ruling their descendants through technology
disguised as divine power -- is the most ambitious and the most
fully realized science fiction novel of the past year, and possibly
of the decade.

The scope is immense: an entire civilization, with its politics, its
theology, its art, and its revolutions, rendered with the mythic
grandeur and the stylistic precision that are Zelazny's twin
signatures. The prose is magnificent -- dense, allusive, and
beautiful in the way that language becomes beautiful when it is
being used at the absolute limit of its capacity. The characters
are complex, the ideas are profound, and the narrative, despite
its mythic framework, moves with a thriller's momentum.

We argued about this book for three days. We agreed on everything
except whether it is the best novel of 1967 or merely the most
important. We settled on both.

Highest possible recommendation.

Issue #75 -- May 1968

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue, which
we hope will reach you as spring arrives and as the world, which
has been a difficult place lately, offers whatever renewal the
season permits:

"STELLAR ARCHAEOLOGY" by Dr. Vincent Koslov -- A research team

star was deliberately killed. By whom, and why, are questions that
Koslov answers with the rigor and the beauty that have made him
the gold standard of hard SF.

"THE BORDER ITSELF" by Dolores Reyes -- A woman who can walk between
parallel versions of the same city discovers that the border between
realities is not a boundary but a place, and that people live there.
Reyes at her most lyrical and her most politically charged.

"INHERITANCE TAX" by Oscar Lennox -- In a timeline where inheritance
includes not just wealth but memories, a young woman must decide
whether to accept her grandfather's bequest -- and the life he
lived. Lennox's wittiest and most personal story.

"LAST MECHANIC" by Harold "Hal" Mercer -- A space station engineer
discovers she is the last person alive who understands the station's
original systems. Mercer's final story for these pages, and a
fitting farewell.
