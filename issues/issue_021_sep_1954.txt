TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
"Back to School"
by Maxwell Sterling

================================================================================

Dear Reader,

A year ago this month, we published our first "Back to School" issue — a
collection of stories that took as their subject the act of learning, of
encountering knowledge for the first time and being changed by the encounter.
The response from our readers was gratifying enough that we resolved to
make it an annual tradition, and so here we are again, returning to class
with pencils sharpened and imaginations at the ready.

But this year's lesson plan has a somewhat darker syllabus.

The stories gathered in this issue are not concerned solely with the
acquisition of knowledge. They are concerned with its edges — the places
where what we think we know dissolves into what we cannot comprehend, where
the textbook runs out of pages and the student is left standing at the
boundary of the unknown with nothing but curiosity and nerve.

Oscar Lennox opens our pages with a story about a library that contains
too much, including a book that should not exist. Danny Kowalski sends a
thirteen-year-old boy to boarding school on Phobos, where the curriculum
includes mysteries that no teacher has assigned. Dr. Vincent Koslov, our
most rigorous scientist, offers a meditation on the speed of light that
begins with mathematics and ends somewhere considerably more unsettling.
Arthur Wainwright gives us a robot that becomes a teacher, with results
that will alarm any parent who has ever questioned a report card. Theodore
Cain explores a love triangle that mirrors the gravitational instabilities
of a triple-star system. And Lucian Marsh — whose work, I confess, makes
my editorial sleep somewhat restless — presents an academy examination
that tests something far more fundamental than knowledge.

Six stories. Six lessons. Not all of them comforting.

I have received several letters asking whether we plan to increase our page
count. The answer, I am pleased to report, is that beginning with Issue #22
we will add eight pages to our regular format, allowing us to feature longer
stories and expanded departments. Our cover price will remain thirty-five
cents. We believe that a magazine, like an education, should be accessible
to everyone who desires it.

A note on our October issue: it will be our first Halloween special, and
the stories we have assembled are — well, let us say that you may wish
to leave a light on. More details in our Coming Attractions section.

In the meantime, class is in session. Take your seats.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                    THE LIBRARIAN OF BABEL STATION

                         by Oscar Lennox

================================================================================

                              I.

The catalogue was infinite, or close enough to infinite that the
distinction had ceased to matter to anyone except the philosophers, and
they had stopped coming to Babel Station years ago.

Iris Montague stood at the circulation desk on Level Forty-Seven, East
Wing, Section Kappa-Sigma, and regarded the return cart with the weary
affection of a woman who had long since made peace with the impossible.
Seventeen volumes this morning. Four were misfiled — three from adjacent
parallel designations and one that appeared to have originated in a
timeline where the Roman Empire had never fallen and consequently published
its novels in a script that combined Latin with something that looked
uncomfortably like mathematics. She logged each one, affixed the
appropriate routing tags, and placed them in the pneumatic chute that
would carry them to Reshelving, where they would be sorted, classified
according to their timeline of origin, and returned to their proper
places in the stacks.

The stacks.

That word was inadequate, of course. The stacks of Babel Station extended
through six hundred and twelve levels of a cylindrical structure that
orbited the Lagrange point between Earth and Luna, spinning at precisely
0.73 rotations per minute to generate a comfortable artificial gravity
of 0.4 g. The books — physical volumes, every one, because the founders
of Babel Station had believed, with the fervor of the converted, that
knowledge must have weight and texture and the faint smell of binding
glue — occupied shelving that, if uncoiled and laid end to end, would
stretch from the station to Mars during a favorable opposition.

But these were merely the books of Iris's own timeline. The books of
her own familiar history, with its two world wars, its cold war, its
tentative steps into the solar system, its literature of Shakespeare
and Tolstoy and Achebe and all the rest. These occupied, by current
estimate, approximately eleven percent of the total collection.

The remaining eighty-nine percent came from elsewhere.

Babel Station had been constructed in 2031, the product of a collaboration
between the United Nations Library Initiative and the Bern Institute
for Parallel Studies, after Dr. Hendrik Voss's historic demonstration
that information could be transferred between adjacent probability
branches without violating any conservation law then known to physics.
The discovery had implications for energy, for communication, for
transportation — but it was the librarians who moved first.

Within eighteen months of Voss's announcement, the first parallel texts
had been retrieved: a volume of lyric poetry from a timeline in which
the Library of Alexandria had never burned, and a treatise on
aeronautics from a world where the Chinese had reached the Americas in
the twelfth century. Within five years, the retrieval process had been
industrialized. Within ten, Babel Station was open to the public, and
the definition of "the public" had begun to blur at the edges.

Iris had been Head Librarian for seven years. She had taken the position
at thirty-one, making her the youngest person to hold the title and
the first to have grown up in a world where parallel literature was
simply a fact of life rather than a revelation. She had earned her
doctorate in Comparative Bibliographic Studies from the reconstituted
University of Leuven, writing her thesis on narrative divergence patterns
in the novels of parallel-Dickens variants. She had catalogued over forty
thousand volumes from timelines whose histories diverged from her own at
points ranging from the Cambrian explosion to last Tuesday.

She was, by any reasonable measure, the most qualified person alive for
this particular job. She was also, she sometimes suspected, the loneliest.

The station employed a staff of three hundred and twelve, but the stacks
were vast and the shifts were long, and there were entire sections where
Iris could walk for an hour without encountering another human being.
She had grown accustomed to this. She had, if she was honest with
herself, come to prefer it. The books were better company than most
people — more various, more surprising, and far less likely to ask her
why she hadn't married.

She finished processing the returns and was reaching for her tea — cold
now, as it always was by this point in the morning — when the chime
sounded on her console.

New acquisition. Timeline designation: Lambda-7749-Delta. Subject
classification: Pending. Retrieval method: Automated lateral sweep.
Location: Receiving Bay 12, Level Two.

Iris set down her tea and pulled up the retrieval log. The automated
lateral sweeps were a relatively new addition to the station's
acquisition protocols — robotic probes that traversed adjacent probability
branches in systematic patterns, identifying and retrieving volumes
that met certain criteria: physical books, intact, with content that
diverged sufficiently from existing holdings to warrant inclusion in
the collection. The system had been running for fourteen months and had
thus far retrieved approximately six thousand volumes, the vast majority
of which were variants of known works — the same stories told slightly
differently, the same histories with minor alterations, the same
scientific treatises arriving at the same conclusions by different routes.

Occasionally, however, the sweeps brought back something genuinely new.
A novel by an author who did not exist in Iris's timeline. A history of
a war that had never been fought. A scientific paper describing a
technology that her own world had not yet imagined.

These were the acquisitions that made the job worth doing.

She took the lift down to Level Two and walked the long corridor to
Receiving Bay 12, her footsteps echoing on the metal flooring. The bay
was a clean, well-lit room the size of a gymnasium, with rows of
examination tables and a team of three cataloguers who handled the
physical assessment of new arrivals: condition, binding type, paper
composition, language identification, preliminary subject classification.

Today, the team consisted of Martin Ashe, a bearded man of fifty who
had been cataloguing books since before the station was built; Yuki
Tanaka, a precise young woman from the Kyoto National Library on
secondment; and Pavel Novak, a cheerful Czech who claimed to be able to
identify the timeline of origin of any book by smelling the binding.

"Morning, Iris," Martin said, not looking up from the volume he was
examining under a magnifying loupe. "We've got something odd."

"Odd how?"

"Odd in the sense that I've been cataloguing books for twenty-six years
and I've never seen anything quite like this."

He gestured to the far end of the table, where a single volume sat on
a foam cradle. It was a modest book — octavo format, perhaps three
hundred pages, bound in dark blue cloth with no dust jacket. The spine
bore a title in simple gold lettering.

Iris walked to the cradle and leaned down to read the spine.

THE FUTURE HISTORY OF IRIS MONTAGUE.

She straightened.

"Is this a joke?" she said.

"If it is," Martin replied, "it's a very elaborate one. The binding is
consistent with a Lambda-7749-Delta production methodology — their
bookmaking is slightly different from ours, heavier thread, different
adhesive formula. The paper is genuine wood pulp, acid-free, consistent
with mid-twenty-first century production in that branch. The type is
letterpress, not digital. It's a real book, Iris. From a real timeline."

"A real book with my name on it."

"With your name as its title. And as its subject."

Iris looked at the volume. She did not touch it.

"Who is the author?"

"No author credited. No publisher imprint. No date of publication. No
Library of Congress equivalent cataloguing data. It's a ghost — published
by no one, for no one, as far as we can determine."

"That's not possible. Every book has a provenance."

"Every book from our timeline has a provenance. The rules are different
elsewhere. You know that."

She did know that. She had catalogued volumes from timelines where the
concept of individual authorship had never developed, where all books
were considered communal property and bore no names. She had handled
texts from branches where books were grown rather than manufactured,
their pages a form of cultivated cellulose, their words encoded in
patterns of pigmentation that shifted over time. She had encountered
every conceivable variation on the idea of a book.

But she had never encountered a book about herself.

"Have you opened it?" she asked.

"First chapter only. Standard protocol for unclassified acquisitions."

"And?"

Martin removed his loupe and looked at her directly for the first time.
His expression was careful, measured — the expression of a man who had
been thinking about what to say and had not yet decided.

"It's accurate, Iris. The first chapter describes your childhood. Your
parents. The house on Maple Street in Northampton. Your mother's garden.
Your father's workshop. The day you found the book in the attic — the
one that made you want to be a librarian. The details are exact. Not
approximately correct. Not close enough. Exact."

"That information is a matter of public record. I've given interviews.
My thesis has a biographical section."

"The book describes the color of the bicycle you rode when you were
seven. It describes the name of the cat you had when you were nine. It
describes a conversation you had with your mother on the night before
your twelfth birthday, word for word."

"You can't possibly know whether it's word for word."

"Can't I?" He picked up a tablet and handed it to her. On the screen
was a photograph — a page from the book, high-resolution. Iris read it.

The passage described a Tuesday evening in November. Her mother, Clara,
sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of chamomile tea, telling
twelve-year-old Iris about the day she had decided to leave her job at
the insurance company and go back to school. The words were her mother's.
The cadence was her mother's. The small, self-deprecating laugh that
Clara always inserted after saying something she considered too sincere
was there, rendered in prose as a parenthetical: (and here she laughed,
as she always did when she caught herself being earnest).

Iris set the tablet down.

"How far does it go?" she said.

"We read the first chapter only. Twenty-three pages. It covers your
life from birth to age fourteen."

"And the rest?"

"The rest is unread. Protocol requires your authorization before we
proceed with a volume that concerns a living member of staff."

"How many chapters?"

"Twelve. The last is titled 'The Librarian's Last Day.' It's dated."

"Dated when?"

Martin hesitated. "June 14, 2067."

Iris calculated. She would be forty-nine. Thirteen years from now.

"That's very specific," she said.

"Yes."

                              * * *

She did not read the book that day. She placed it in a secure vault on
Level Three, assigned it a classification code — PERSONAL/STAFF/
RESTRICTED — and returned to her duties. She processed fourteen returns,
answered six reference queries, supervised the reshelving of a
collection of parallel-Shakespeare folios that had been misplaced during
a routine stack audit, and ate lunch alone in the staff cafeteria,
staring at a sandwich she did not taste.

The question was simple, and it was old. It was the question that every
student of parallel literature encountered sooner or later, the question
that had occupied three chapters of her doctoral thesis and that she
had answered with what she had believed, at the time, was satisfying
intellectual rigor.

The question was: Does a book from a parallel timeline describe the
truth?

Her doctoral answer had been carefully hedged. A parallel text, she had
written, describes a truth — a state of affairs that obtains in its
timeline of origin. It does not necessarily describe a truth that
obtains in the reader's timeline. The histories diverge. The facts
diverge. A novel about Napoleon winning at Waterloo is a true account
of events in a timeline where Napoleon won at Waterloo. It is fiction
in any timeline where he did not.

This was the orthodox position, and it was, as far as it went,
unobjectionable.

But it did not address the problem of a book that described not a
divergent past but a convergent future. A book from another timeline
that purported to describe events that had not yet occurred in the
reader's own.

The theoretical literature on this subject was extensive and
contradictory. The Voss school held that futures were inherently
divergent — that the probability branches separated continuously and
irreversibly, making cross-timeline prediction impossible by definition.
The Bern school, more cautiously, suggested that certain patterns of
convergence might exist — that some events were robust across branches,
occurring in the same way regardless of which path history had taken.
A third school, smaller and more radical, argued that the parallel
branches were not truly parallel at all but were instead facets of a
single, higher-dimensional structure, and that information about the
future could, in principle, propagate laterally through this structure
in the same way that information about the past already did.

Iris had always aligned herself with the Voss school. Futures diverged.
Prediction across branches was impossible. The book in her vault was
an artifact of Lambda-7749-Delta, and whatever future it described was
the future of its Iris Montague — an Iris who shared her past but who
would not, could not, share her future.

This was the rational position.

She ate the sandwich. She returned to her desk. She worked until the
end of her shift. She went to her quarters — a small, comfortable suite
on Level Sixty-Two with a view of the Earth through a broad window
that she kept curtained most of the time because the beauty of it
distracted her from reading.

She sat on her bed and thought about the bicycle. It had been red. The
cat's name had been Ptolemy. The book had not been wrong about either.

She did not sleep well.

                              II.

She lasted four days.

On the fifth morning, she went to the vault before her shift, keyed
the access code, and retrieved the volume. She carried it to her
private office — a small room adjacent to the circulation desk, lined
with shelves that held her personal collection of reference works and a
few well-loved novels — and she sat at her desk and opened it to the
second chapter.

The second chapter was titled "Leuven." It described her years at the
university with the same uncanny precision that had characterized the
first chapter. Her professors. Her dormitory. The café on Naamsestraat
where she had written most of her thesis, drinking coffee so strong
that it left a residue on the cup that could not be removed without
industrial solvents. Her friendship with Anke, the Belgian woman who
had studied medieval manuscripts and who had once, memorably, gotten
drunk and delivered a forty-minute lecture on the typography of the
Gutenberg Bible to a bewildered bartender.

Every detail was correct. Not in the approximate way that a good guess
might be correct, but in the specific, granular, unmistakable way that
memory is correct. The book knew things that no public record contained.
It knew the color of the curtains in her dormitory room. It knew the
title of the novel she had been reading the night she first kissed a
woman — a parallel-Austen variant from Timeline Epsilon-1182, in which
Elizabeth Bennet had been a cartographer rather than a gentleman's
daughter, and in which Mr. Darcy had been a lighthouse keeper.

It knew the name she had whispered in the dark afterward, and the name
was the right name.

She closed the book and sat for a long time.

Then she opened the third chapter.

                              * * *

The third chapter was titled "The Station." It described her arrival at
Babel Station, her first years as a junior cataloguer, her rapid
promotion through the ranks, and her appointment as Head Librarian. It
described her colleagues with the kind of intimate, affectionate
precision that suggested the author — whoever or whatever the author
was — had observed them at close range. Martin's habit of humming
Puccini arias while examining bindings. Yuki's system of color-coded
tabs that had revolutionized the cataloguing of non-Roman scripts.
Pavel's entirely fraudulent claim to identify timelines by smell,
which Iris had never had the heart to debunk because it made him so
happy.

The chapter ended with a passage that Iris read three times:

   The librarian understood, by her seventh year in the position,
   that the station was not merely a repository. It was an argument.
   It argued, by the sheer accumulated weight of its holdings, that
   no single version of the truth was sufficient. That every story
   had been told in every possible way. That the only honest response
   to the question "What happened?" was "Which time?"

   She found this liberating. She also found it terrifying. Because
   if every version of every story existed somewhere in the stacks,
   then her own story — the one she was living, the one she believed
   she was choosing — was already written. Already shelved. Already
   gathering dust in some distant wing of the collection, waiting
   for a reader who might never come.

   Or who might come tomorrow.

Iris turned to the fourth chapter. She noticed that her hands were
trembling. She noticed that she did not stop.

                              III.

The fourth chapter described events that had not yet happened.

It was titled "The Cartographer," and it began:

   In September of 2056, a woman named Lena Ostrova arrived at
   Babel Station carrying a single suitcase, a letter of introduction
   from the reconstituted Library of St. Petersburg, and a theory
   that would change the way the station understood its own
   collection.

Iris did not know anyone named Lena Ostrova. A search of the station's
personnel files, the Bern Institute's faculty directory, and the
International Library Network's membership rolls produced no results.
She searched the parallel catalogues — the vast indexed database that
tracked individuals known to exist across multiple timelines — and
found Lena Ostrovas in seventeen branches, none of whom had any
documented connection to Babel Station.

The book described Lena as a cartographer of probability space — a
discipline that did not, as far as Iris was aware, exist. The book
described her theory in terms that were lucid, detailed, and entirely
original: a method for mapping the topological relationships between
adjacent timelines, for determining not merely that they diverged but
how they diverged, in what direction, at what rate, and — this was the
revolutionary part — toward what attractor states they were converging.

The book claimed that Lena Ostrova would demonstrate that certain
futures were not merely possible but inevitable. That across the vast
branching tree of probability, certain outcomes were so robust, so
deeply embedded in the structure of the multiverse, that they occurred
in every timeline without exception. Birth. Death. The formation of
stars. The evolution of curiosity. And certain specific human events
that the book enumerated with the calm precision of a timetable.

Including the death of Iris Montague, Head Librarian of Babel Station,
on June 14, 2067, at 3:17 in the afternoon, in the East Wing of Level
Forty-Seven, at her circulation desk, of a cerebral aneurysm that
would give no prior warning.

Iris closed the book.

She opened it again.

She read the passage once more, carefully, as though the precision of
her reading might alter what was written.

It did not.

She placed the book on her desk and walked to the window of her office.
Outside, the stars were fixed and silent, and the Earth hung in the
lower left quadrant of the frame, blue and white and impossibly
beautiful, turning with the unhurried patience of something that has
all the time in the world.

Thirteen years. She would have thirteen more years.

The thought was strange and flat and did not seem to refer to her. She
tried to feel something — fear, grief, the electric jolt of mortality
that she imagined most people would feel upon learning the date and
manner of their death — but what she felt instead was a kind of
professional curiosity. The same curiosity she felt when a new
acquisition arrived from an unfamiliar timeline. The desire to
understand. To classify. To place the information in its proper context
and shelve it where it belonged.

She was, she realized, responding to the news of her own death the way
a librarian would. She was trying to catalogue it.

                              * * *

She read the rest of the book over the following week, rationing herself
to one chapter per day, taking notes in the margins with a pencil as
though she were reviewing a manuscript for publication.

The fifth chapter, "The Collection Grows," described the acquisition of
a set of volumes from a timeline in which humanity had achieved faster-
than-light travel in the nineteenth century and had spent the subsequent
two hundred years building libraries on every habitable world in the
local stellar neighborhood. The parallel texts from this timeline were
staggering in their scope — an alien literature that was recognizably
human in its concerns but alien in its perspectives, shaped by the
experience of a species that had never known the loneliness of a single
world. The book described Iris's response to these acquisitions with
the specificity of a biographer who had access to her private journals:
the tears she did not shed in front of her staff, the night she spent
sitting alone in the stacks surrounded by volumes in languages she
could not read, feeling for the first time the full weight of what the
station meant.

The sixth chapter, "Parallels," described a period of personal crisis.
Iris, confronting the book's claims about her future, began to question
the foundations of the Voss school — the theoretical framework she had
built her career upon. If futures diverged, then the book was
meaningless, a fiction from a foreign branch. But if the Bern school
was right, if certain futures converged, then the book might be a
prophecy. And if the third school was right — the radical school, the
school of higher-dimensional unity — then the book was not a prophecy
at all. It was a report. A factual account of events that were, in
some sense she could not yet articulate, already real.

The seventh chapter, "Lena Arrives," described the arrival of Lena
Ostrova at Babel Station in September of 2056, exactly as predicted.
The description was so detailed that Iris found herself composing a
mental image of the woman: tall, dark-haired, with the careful posture
of someone who spent too much time hunched over manuscripts, and a
voice that carried the faint trace of a Russian accent even when she
was speaking perfect English. The book described their first
conversation — a discussion about the topological properties of
probability space that lasted four hours and left Iris feeling, for the
first time in years, that she was in the presence of a mind that moved
at the same speed as her own.

The eighth chapter, "The Map," described the development of Lena's
cartographic method and its application to the station's collection. The
results were extraordinary. Lena demonstrated that the books in the
stacks were not randomly distributed across probability space but were
clustered along what she called convergence ridges — topological features
of the multiverse where adjacent timelines ran close together, like
mountain ridges channeling water into the same valley. The station,
Lena argued, was not merely collecting books. It was mapping the deep
structure of reality itself.

The ninth chapter was called "The Correspondence." It described a period
of intense intellectual and personal intimacy between Iris and Lena.
They wrote letters to each other — actual letters, handwritten on paper,
delivered by hand through the station's internal mail system — because
both of them believed that certain kinds of knowledge required the
weight and permanence of physical form. The letters discussed topology,
bibliography, the nature of truth, the relationship between stories and
the realities they described, the question of whether a life could be
considered a narrative and, if so, who its author was.

The letters also described a love affair. It was written with such
tenderness and precision that Iris, reading it, felt simultaneously
as though she were eavesdropping on a stranger's most private moments
and recognizing, with a shock of familiarity, the exact shape of her
own longing.

The tenth chapter was titled "The Question." In it, Iris — the Iris of
the book, the Iris of Timeline Lambda-7749-Delta — confronted Lena with
the existence of the volume itself. She told Lena about the book she
had found. She described its predictions. She asked the question that
had been growing inside her like a vine in a dark room, seeking light:

   "If the book is accurate — if it describes my future with the
   same precision that it described my past — then is this" — she
   gestured between them, at the desk covered with letters, at the
   cups of tea gone cold, at the space between their chairs that
   had grown smaller with each conversation — "is this real? Or
   are we simply doing what the book says we will do, like actors
   following a script?"

Lena's response, as described in the book, was to pick up one of their
letters — the fourth letter, dated October 12 — and read aloud a
passage in which Iris had described the experience of shelving a book
she had loved: the reluctance to let it go, the knowledge that it
would sit on the shelf unchanged while she walked away changed, and
the strange comfort of knowing that it would be there whenever she
returned.

   "That," Lena said, setting the letter down. "That is what is
   real. Not the prediction. Not the script. The experience of
   reading. The change it produces in the reader. The book in your
   vault knows what happens to you. But it does not know what it is
   like. That — the felt quality, the lived texture of your days —
   that belongs to you alone. No parallel text can capture it. No
   catalogue can contain it."

Iris, reading this in her office on Level Forty-Seven, set the book
down and pressed her fingertips to the bridge of her nose. She was
not crying. She was experiencing a physiological response to the
accumulation of detail, a pressure behind the eyes that she chose to
interpret as the result of reading too long in artificial light.

She picked the book up again.

                              IV.

The eleventh chapter was called "The Librarian's Work." It described the
final years of Iris's career: the expansion of the station, the
development of new retrieval technologies, the growing political
controversies surrounding cross-timeline information transfer, and Iris's
quiet, persistent defense of the principle that had guided the station
from its founding — that knowledge, in all its variants, belonged to
everyone.

It described Lena's departure in 2061, called back to St. Petersburg
by a university position she could not refuse. It described the letters
that continued, growing longer and less frequent, the way letters do
when distance makes them precious and time makes them heavy. It described
Iris's solitude, which was different now from the solitude she had known
before Lena — not the comfortable aloneness of a woman who preferred
books to people, but the sharp, specific absence of a particular person.

The twelfth chapter was titled "The Librarian's Last Day."

It was the shortest chapter. Three pages. It described June 14, 2067,
from morning to afternoon. Iris waking in her quarters. Iris dressing
in her usual clothes — a gray wool skirt, a white blouse, flat shoes
suitable for walking the stacks. Iris eating breakfast alone — two
pieces of toast and a cup of tea, as always. Iris taking the lift to
Level Forty-Seven. Iris sitting at her circulation desk and opening her
console to begin the morning's work.

The passage described the last book she processed: a return, a novel
from Timeline Kappa-2201, in which a woman who worked in a library
fell in love with a cartographer. Iris logged it, tagged it, placed it
in the pneumatic chute. She reached for her tea.

And then the chapter ended.

Not with a description of the aneurysm. Not with a clinical account of
the event itself. The chapter ended with a single paragraph:

   The librarian reached for her tea. Outside the window, the stars
   were fixed and silent, and the Earth hung in the lower left
   quadrant of the frame, turning with the unhurried patience of
   something that has all the time in the world. The tea was cold.
   It was always cold by this point in the morning. She drank it
   anyway. She had never minded cold tea. It tasted the same. It
   was the same tea. Only the temperature had changed, and
   temperature, as any physicist would tell you, is merely a
   measure of the average kinetic energy of molecules in motion.
   A measure of how fast things are moving. A measure, the
   librarian thought, of how much time they have left.

   She set down the cup and returned to her work.

Iris closed the book.

                              * * *

She sat in her office for a long time after finishing it. The station
hummed around her — the deep, constant vibration of the rotational
motors, the faint hiss of the atmospheric systems, the distant clatter
of the pneumatic chutes carrying books to their appointed places. These
sounds had been the background of her life for seven years. She had
stopped hearing them long ago. She heard them now.

She opened her console and composed a cataloguing entry:

   Title: THE FUTURE HISTORY OF IRIS MONTAGUE
   Author: Unknown
   Timeline of origin: Lambda-7749-Delta
   Subject classification: Biography (predictive)
   Physical description: Octavo, 298 pp., blue cloth binding,
   gold-stamped spine, no dust jacket
   Condition: Fine
   Access restriction: NONE

She hesitated over the last line. Then she confirmed it.

She placed the book in the pneumatic chute and sent it to Reshelving,
with a routing tag that would place it in the general collection, on a
shelf in the Biography section of the Lambda-7749-Delta wing, between
a history of a woman who had been the first human to walk on Titan and
a memoir by a man who had spent forty years translating a single alien
poem.

It would sit there, on its shelf, in the vast and patient stacks.
Anyone could read it. No one might. That was the nature of a library.
The books were there, whether anyone opened them or not. They contained
what they contained. The truth of them was not contingent on being
read.

Iris Montague, Head Librarian of Babel Station, thirty-six years old,
with thirteen years remaining or an entire lifetime ahead of her
depending on which school of thought she chose to believe, stood up
from her desk and walked into the stacks.

She had work to do.

There were books to shelve, queries to answer, a vast and branching
collection to maintain. The catalogue was infinite, or close enough
to infinite that the distinction had ceased to matter to anyone except
the philosophers. And the philosophers, she reminded herself, had
stopped coming years ago.

Perhaps that was because they had already found what they were looking
for. Or perhaps it was because they had realized that the finding was
not the point.

The searching was.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                      FRESHMAN YEAR ON PHOBOS

                        by Danny Kowalski

================================================================================

                              I.

The shuttle from Mars Orbital hit Phobos at seven in the morning, local
station time, which meant nothing because Phobos didn't have a morning.
It was a potato-shaped rock tumbling through space with the sun on one
side and Mars filling up the other side like a giant rusty ceiling, and
the only reason they called it morning was because somebody had decided
the clocks should start at midnight and work forward, same as on Earth,
and Tomas Reyes was standing at the porthole with his forehead pressed
against the cold glass thinking: This is the dumbest place I have ever
been in my life.

He was thirteen. He had been thirteen for exactly eleven days, having
celebrated his birthday on the transfer shuttle from Earth with a
freeze-dried cake that tasted like cardboard and a candle that wouldn't
stay lit in the regulated atmosphere. His mother had sung "Happy
Birthday" over the comm-link from Flagstaff, Arizona, seventeen minutes
away at the speed of light, which meant that by the time her voice
reached him she was already singing a different song or making dinner or
doing whatever people did on a Tuesday evening in Flagstaff when their
only son was hurtling through space toward a rock named after a Greek
word that meant "fear."

His dad had not called. His dad was on Ganymede, doing something with
ice-mining that Tomas did not fully understand and that his mother
described with a tightness around her mouth that meant she understood it
perfectly and wished she didn't.

"Passengers for Bradbury Academy, please proceed to Docking Bay Three
with your luggage and enrollment documents," the shuttle's intercom said,
in the flat, helpful voice that all intercom systems seemed to share
regardless of which planet they were on. "Welcome to Phobos."

Tomas picked up his duffel bag. It contained everything he owned that
would fit: four sets of the Academy uniform (gray trousers, white shirt,
blue blazer with the Bradbury crest, which was a rocket ship
superimposed on an open book, which was the corniest thing he had ever
seen), two pairs of shoes, his sketchpad, a box of pencils, three
paperback novels his mother had insisted he bring ("Real books, Tomas,
not screens"), a photograph of his family taken two years ago when they
were still a family that lived in the same house, and a small rock from
the backyard in Flagstaff that his mother had pressed into his hand at
the spaceport and said, "So you remember where the ground is."

He was one of forty-seven new freshmen. He knew this because the
enrollment packet had said so: "Bradbury Academy welcomes forty-seven
new students to the Class of 2039." The packet had also said that
Bradbury Academy was "the Solar System's premier residential secondary
school, offering a rigorous curriculum in science, mathematics, and the
liberal arts in a unique low-gravity environment." It had not said
anything about the food, which Tomas suspected was an ominous omission.

Docking Bay Three was a large, gray room that smelled like machine oil
and recycled air. The forty-seven freshmen milled around in their new
blazers, looking exactly like what they were: kids who had been taken
from their homes and deposited in a tin can on a rock in space and who
were trying very hard to look like they were fine with this.

Some of them were fine with it. A tall girl with red hair and freckles
was already talking to three other students as though she'd known them
for years, laughing and gesturing with her hands in a way that suggested
she had opinions about everything and was not shy about sharing them. A
thin boy with dark skin and enormous glasses was reading a book — an
actual paper book — while leaning against the wall with the practiced
nonchalance of someone who had decided that the best way to handle a
new situation was to pretend it wasn't happening. A group of four boys
were comparing wrist-comps and talking too loudly, the way boys talked
when they were nervous and didn't want anyone to know.

Tomas stood by himself near the porthole and looked at Mars.

It was enormous. He had seen pictures, of course — everyone had seen
pictures — but pictures didn't prepare you for the size of it, the way
it filled the window like a wall of rust and dust and ancient dry river
beds, so close that you felt like you could reach out and touch it, so
far away that the thought of touching it made you dizzy. The Valles
Marineris cut across the surface like a scar, and the polar cap gleamed
white at the edge of the visible hemisphere, and somewhere down there,
on the surface, in a pressurized dome called Ares City, twelve thousand
people were living their lives as though it were perfectly normal to
live on another planet.

It wasn't normal. Nothing about this was normal. Tomas was thirteen
years old and he was standing on a moon named Fear looking down at a
planet named after the god of war and in approximately twenty minutes
he was going to start ninth grade.

"Pretty cool, huh?"

He turned. The boy standing next to him was stocky and blond, with a
round face and a gap between his front teeth that gave him the look of
someone who was perpetually about to grin. He was wearing his blazer
with the sleeves rolled up, which was technically a uniform violation,
and he had a smear of something that looked like chocolate on his chin.

"I guess," Tomas said.

"I'm Erik. Erik Sandoval. From São Paulo. Well, from São Paulo and then
Luna City and then the transfer shuttle, which had the worst food I've
ever eaten, and I've eaten at my grandmother's house, so that's saying
something." He stuck out his hand.

Tomas shook it. "Tomas Reyes. Flagstaff."

"Flagstaff! That's where the observatory is, right? Lowell? You ever
look through the big telescope?"

"Once. On a field trip."

"What did you see?"

"Mars."

Erik laughed. It was a big, unguarded laugh that seemed too large for
the docking bay, and several heads turned in their direction. "And now
you're here! That's like — that's like looking through a window and then
climbing through it. That's great. I think we're going to be friends,
Tomas."

"You just met me."

"I have a sense for these things. My mother says I have the social
instincts of a golden retriever. I've never seen a golden retriever, on
account of growing up on the Moon, but I've seen pictures, and they
look like excellent judges of character."

Despite everything — the homesickness, the dread, the freeze-dried cake
still sitting in his stomach like a small dense planet — Tomas smiled.

                              II.

The first week was orientation, and orientation was a blur.

The campus was built into the interior of Phobos itself, carved out of
the rocky substrate and reinforced with structural composites that the
engineering teacher, Dr. Okafor, described as "essentially the same
material they use for spacecraft hulls, which should give you some idea
of the forces involved in keeping this place from collapsing." This
information was presumably meant to be reassuring. It was not.

The gravity was the first thing you noticed and the last thing you got
used to. Phobos had a surface gravity of about 0.006 m/s squared, which
was essentially nothing, but the station's rotational system brought it
up to a livable 0.38 g — Mars standard, which the brochure called
"comfortable" and which Tomas's body called "wrong." Everything was too
light. His feet didn't hit the floor with the right authority. His
water didn't pour at the right speed. His pencils, when he set them
down on his desk, drifted imperceptibly toward the edge and fell with a
slow, dreamlike tumble that made him feel like he was living inside a
movie played at the wrong speed.

The gym was the worst.

The gymnasium occupied a large spherical chamber at the center of the
station, and it operated at variable gravity — a system of adjustable
rotational compensators that could set the gravity anywhere from zero-g
to Mars standard, depending on the activity. During orientation, the
gym teacher — a wiry, intense woman named Coach Petrov who spoke in
short declarative sentences and appeared to have been assembled from
cable and determination — set it to zero-g and told the freshmen to
play a game she called "scatterball."

Scatterball, as far as Tomas could determine, was a sport invented by
someone who hated the concept of predictable motion. Two teams, one
ball, no floor, no ceiling, no walls that weren't also goals. You
launched yourself off a surface, caught the ball, threw it at the
opposing team's goal zone, and hoped that Newton's third law wouldn't
send you spinning into a teammate. It was exhilarating and terrifying
and absolutely nothing like any sport Tomas had ever played in Flagstaff,
where the ground stayed where you put it and the ball came down after
you threw it up.

He was bad at it. He was bad at it in a specific, humiliating way that
involved launching himself at the ball, missing, continuing in a
straight line past the ball, past the goal zone, past the boundary
markers, and into the padded wall of the gymnasium, where he stuck like
a bug on a windshield while his classmates pretended not to notice.

Erik, somehow, was a natural. He tumbled through zero-g with the
instinctive grace of someone who had grown up on Luna and understood in
his bones that gravity was a suggestion rather than a law. He scored
three goals in the first game and helped Tomas peel himself off the
wall twice.

"You'll get it," Erik said, clapping him on the back in a way that sent
both of them rotating gently counterclockwise. "It just takes practice.
And maybe some spatial reasoning. And definitely less flailing."

"I wasn't flailing."

"You were flailing, my friend. You were flailing with great commitment
and enthusiasm. It was almost beautiful."

The classes were better. Tomas liked math, and the math teacher — a
quiet, patient woman named Dr. Vasquez who had a way of explaining
things that made you feel like you were discovering the answer yourself
rather than being told it — was the best teacher he'd ever had. He liked
biology, which involved studying organisms adapted to low-gravity and
vacuum environments, including a species of engineered lichen that grew
on the exterior of the station and slowly, over decades, was converting
Phobos's surface regolith into something that might one day support a
breathable atmosphere. He liked English, which was taught by an
enthusiastic young man named Mr. Park who assigned them science fiction
novels and asked them to write about "the experience of being the
future that these books imagined."

He did not like history, which was taught by a dusty, monotonous man
named Mr. Griffith who appeared to believe that the purpose of
education was to transform interesting events into boring sentences.
He did not like chemistry, because the lab involved handling compounds
in low gravity, which meant that anything you spilled floated instead
of running down the table, and Tomas spilled a lot. He especially did
not like the fact that his dormitory room was approximately the size
of a closet and that his roommate — a pale, quiet boy named Jun from
the Tharsis Plateau settlement — communicated almost exclusively through
a series of noncommittal grunts that Tomas was slowly learning to
interpret. (One grunt: acknowledgment. Two grunts: disagreement. Three
grunts: I am going to sleep and would appreciate it if you turned off
your reading light.)

But the thing he liked least was Declan Boyce.

                              III.

Declan Boyce was fifteen. He was a junior. He was tall and broad-
shouldered and had the kind of face that looked like it had been
designed by a committee tasked with creating the most punchable
expression possible: a permanent half-smirk, eyes that calculated
distance and weakness with the efficiency of a targeting system, a jaw
that he thrust forward when he talked as though daring you to
disagree.

He was also the captain of the scatterball varsity team, the son of
the station's chief medical officer, and — Tomas learned this in the
second week — the person who had decided that Tomas Reyes was going to
have a difficult year.

It started small. A shoulder check in the hallway, hard enough to send
Tomas stumbling in the low gravity, played off as an accident.
"Careful, freshman. Gravity's tricky." A comment in the cafeteria about
Tomas's accent, delivered just loud enough for the surrounding tables
to hear: "Hey, Reyes, do they have schools in Arizona, or do they
just let the coyotes raise you?" Laughter from the juniors. Silence
from the freshmen, who understood instinctively the mathematics of
power and knew that the equation did not favor intervention.

Tomas told himself it didn't matter. He had dealt with bullies before —
in Flagstaff, there had been a kid named Travis who had made fun of
his father being gone, and Tomas had handled it by ignoring Travis
until Travis got bored and moved on to someone else. The strategy had
worked on Earth. He tried it on Phobos.

It did not work on Phobos.

Declan Boyce did not get bored. If anything, Tomas's refusal to react
seemed to sharpen Declan's interest, like a predator whose attention is
drawn by stillness rather than motion. The shoulder checks became harder.
The comments became more personal. In the third week, Tomas opened his
locker to find his sketchpad — the one his mother had given him, the one
he drew in every night before bed, the one that contained landscapes
of Flagstaff and imaginary maps of Mars and a careful, precise drawing
of his family's house that he had done from memory on the second night
because he was afraid he was already starting to forget what it looked
like — had been taken out, and on the first page, in thick black
marker, someone had written: GO HOME DIRT BOY.

Tomas stared at the words for a long time. Then he tore out the page,
folded it, put it in his pocket, and closed his locker.

He did not tell anyone. He was thirteen years old and he was very far
from home and the one thing he knew with absolute certainty was that
telling someone would make it worse.

                              * * *

The girl with the red hair was named Saoirse Flynn, and she was from
Dublin, Ireland, by way of the Mars orbital transit hub, and she was
the smartest person Tomas had ever met, and when she walked into a room
it was as though someone had turned up the brightness on a screen.

He did not have a crush on her. He was certain of this. The tightness in
his chest when she sat next to him in math class was a respiratory
response to the station's air recycling system. The fact that he had
drawn her face in his sketchpad — twice, from memory, late at night
when Jun was grunting his way through sleep — was an exercise in
portraiture. The way his voice went up half an octave when she asked
him a direct question was a perfectly normal acoustic phenomenon that
probably had something to do with the atmospheric pressure.

"You're good at math," she said to him one day in the third week, as
they were walking out of Dr. Vasquez's class. She said it the way she
said everything: directly, without preamble, as though the thought had
occurred to her and the distance between thinking it and saying it was
too short to bother with.

"Thanks," he said, in a voice that was definitely not half an octave
higher than normal.

"I'm not. Good at math, I mean. I'm good at everything else, but math
is like — it's like the numbers are doing something behind my back and I
can't catch them at it. Do you want to study together sometime?"

"Sure," he said, with a casualness that he suspected fooled absolutely
no one.

They studied together in the library, which was a small, comfortable
room on Level Four with actual paper books on actual shelves — a luxury
that the Academy's founders had insisted on, believing that a school
without a physical library was not a school but a data terminal with
pretensions. Saoirse sat across from Tomas and frowned at equations and
asked questions that were sharper than she realized and laughed when
Tomas explained things in ways that involved drawing pictures instead
of writing formulas.

"You should be a teacher," she said. "You explain things like you're
telling a story."

"I want to be an engineer," he said. "Or an artist. Or both. I haven't
decided."

"Be both. Why not? This is the future. You can be both."

She smiled at him, and the air recycling system did something to his
chest again.

                              IV.

The dead birds appeared in the fourth week.

Tomas found the first one on a Tuesday morning, in the ventilation
shaft above his dormitory room. He had been lying in bed, unable to
sleep — Jun was grunting his way through what sounded like a
particularly contentious dream — when he heard a sound in the vent: a
soft, dry rustling, like paper being crumpled very slowly. He got up,
stood on his desk chair, and unscrewed the vent cover.

Inside the duct, resting on the metal surface as though it had been
carefully placed there, was a small brown bird. A sparrow, or something
very like a sparrow. It was dead. Its feathers were dry and neat, its
eyes closed, its feet curled beneath it in the posture of sleep.

Tomas stared at it for a long time.

There were no birds on Phobos. There were no birds anywhere in the
outer solar system. The Academy's environmental systems supported a
closed ecology that included engineered plants, recycling bacteria,
and a small population of pollinating insects, but no vertebrate animals
of any kind. The logistics of maintaining a bird population in a sealed
space station — the food requirements, the waste management, the
territorial behavior, the noise — made it impractical to the point of
impossibility.

And yet here was a bird. A dead bird. In his ventilation shaft.

He reached in and picked it up. It was light, even for a bird — lighter
than he expected, as though the low gravity had leached something from
it, or as though it had never been fully real. He turned it over in his
hands. No injuries. No marks. No signs of illness or trauma. It looked
like a bird that had simply decided to stop being alive and had arranged
itself neatly in his ventilation shaft to do so.

He reported it to the maintenance department, who sent a technician
named Garcia who looked at the bird, looked at the ventilation shaft,
looked at Tomas, and said, "Huh."

"Is that a technical assessment?" Tomas asked.

Garcia did not smile. "There are no birds on this station."

"I know."

"So this is not a bird."

"It looks like a bird."

"A lot of things look like things they're not. I'll log it." He took
the bird, put it in a sample bag, and left. Tomas did not hear anything
further about it.

The second bird appeared three days later, in the ventilation shaft of
Saoirse's dormitory room. She told Tomas about it at breakfast, her
eyes wide, her voice carrying that particular quality of excitement that
she got when something didn't make sense and she wanted to make it make
sense.

"It was a finch," she said. "A little yellow finch. Dead. Just sitting
in the vent like someone put it there."

"I found one too," Tomas said. "Last Tuesday. A sparrow."

"Did you tell maintenance?"

"They said they'd log it."

"That's exactly what they said to me. 'We'll log it.' What does that
even mean? Where do you log a dead bird on a station that has no birds?"

"In the file with the other things that don't make sense?"

"There's a file?"

"I'm guessing."

Erik, who had been eating his oatmeal with the focused intensity of
someone who had strong opinions about breakfast, looked up. "I heard
Chen in Room 307 found one too. A robin. In his vent, same as yours."

They looked at each other.

"That's three," Saoirse said. "Three dead birds in three different
ventilation shafts. Three species that don't exist on this station."

"Four," said a quiet voice. They turned. Jun — Tomas's roommate, the
boy of the grunts — was sitting at the end of the table with his tray,
which he had not touched. He was looking at them with an expression that
Tomas had never seen on his face before: not his usual studied blankness,
but something sharper. Something alert.

"Four?" Tomas said.

"I found one last night. A blackbird. In the shaft above my bed. I did
not tell maintenance."

"Why not?"

Jun looked at his tray. "Because the last time I reported something
strange on this station, they told me I was adjusting to the
environment. They said that new students sometimes experience perceptual
disturbances in the first few weeks. They said it was normal."

"What did you report?"

Jun was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "Music. Coming from the
vents. Late at night, after lights out. Very faint. Like someone
singing, but far away. In a language I didn't recognize."

The four of them sat in silence.

Outside the cafeteria windows, Mars turned slowly beneath them, vast
and red and indifferent, and the ventilation system hummed its constant,
empty hum.

                              V.

They decided to investigate because they were thirteen and because
they had read enough books to know that when dead birds appeared in a
place that had no birds, you did not file a maintenance report and wait.
You investigated.

Or rather, Saoirse decided they would investigate, and the rest of them
went along because Saoirse had a way of making you feel that not
investigating would be a personal failure of curiosity, and curiosity
was the one quality that everyone at Bradbury Academy agreed was
non-negotiable.

They started with the ventilation system. The station's environmental
schematics were available in the library — this was, after all, a
school, and the Academy believed in transparency about the engineering
that kept its students alive. Tomas pulled up the plans on the library's
main terminal and spread them across the study table, and the four of
them leaned over them the way generals lean over maps.

The ventilation system was a closed loop: air was drawn from the
habitable areas, filtered through carbon scrubbers and biological
processors, re-oxygenated, temperature-adjusted, and returned through
the network of ducts that ran through the ceilings and walls of every
room. The ducts were sealed. Nothing should be able to get into them
from outside the station, because outside the station was vacuum, and
nothing should be able to get into them from inside the station,
because the intake vents were covered with filters fine enough to block
particles down to ten microns.

"So how does a bird get into a sealed duct?" Erik asked.

"It doesn't," Saoirse said. "That's the point. It can't get in from
outside and it can't get in from inside, which means either someone is
putting them there or they're — coming from somewhere else."

"Somewhere else meaning what?"

She didn't answer. She was looking at the schematic, tracing the duct
network with her finger, following the lines as they branched and
converged through the station's interior. Her finger stopped at a point
near the center of the diagram.

"What's this?" she said.

Tomas looked. The duct network, which everywhere else was drawn in clean,
precise lines with standard engineering annotations, became vague at
the point Saoirse was indicating. The lines converged toward a central
chamber — or what appeared to be a central chamber — but the chamber
itself was not drawn. In its place was a simple notation: SECTION 7-G.
NO STUDENT ACCESS.

"It's a restricted area," Tomas said.

"Everything is a restricted area if you're thirteen," Saoirse replied.
"What's in Section 7-G?"

They searched the library's database. Section 7-G was listed in the
station directory as "Environmental Processing — Authorized Personnel
Only." No further description. No floor plan. No personnel assignments.

"That's weird," Erik said. "Everything else on this station has a floor
plan. The bathrooms have floor plans."

Jun, who had been silent throughout, spoke. "The birds are coming from
there."

"You don't know that," Tomas said.

"The ducts converge there. The birds are in the ducts. The birds are
coming from there." He said this with the flat certainty of someone
who had already done the math and was waiting for the rest of them to
catch up.

"Even if they are," Tomas said, "we can't get to Section 7-G. It's
restricted."

Saoirse looked at him. She had a specific look that she deployed in
moments like this — a look that combined disappointment with patience,
as though she were waiting for him to stop being sensible and start
being interesting.

"We're on a space station on a moon named Fear," she said. "We just
found dead birds that can't exist. There's a restricted section that
nobody will explain. And you want to follow the rules?"

"I want to not get expelled in my first month."

"Tomas. Dead birds."

He looked at her. She looked at him. Mars turned beneath them.

"Fine," he said.

                              VI.

They went at night, which on Phobos meant after the artificial lights
in the corridors dimmed to their nighttime setting of forty percent and
the residential wings went quiet. Tomas and Erik left their rooms at
0200, moving through the corridors in their socks to muffle their
footsteps, and met Saoirse and Jun at the junction of Corridor Eight
and the maintenance access hallway that led, according to the schematics,
toward the general vicinity of Section 7-G.

The maintenance hallway was not designed for students. The ceiling was
low, the lighting was industrial, and the floor was a metal grating
through which they could see pipes and conduits running in every
direction. The air was warmer here, and it carried a smell that Tomas
couldn't identify — not unpleasant, exactly, but strange. Organic. Like
soil after rain, except they were inside a hollowed-out rock in space
and there was no soil and there was no rain.

They followed the corridor for what felt like a long time, past sealed
doors marked with alphanumeric codes (7-A, 7-B, 7-C), past junction
boxes and emergency oxygen stations and a fire extinguisher that looked
like it had never been used. The corridor narrowed. The lights became
less frequent. The hum of the environmental systems grew louder, deeper,
as though they were approaching the heart of something that was working
very hard to keep them alive.

Section 7-G was behind a door that was different from the others.
Heavier. The door was marked with the standard restricted-access sign —
a red circle with a line through it — and beneath that, in smaller
letters, a notice that read: ENVIRONMENTAL PROCESSING. AUTHORIZED
PERSONNEL ONLY. BIOLOGICAL CONTAINMENT PROTOCOLS IN EFFECT.

"Biological containment," Erik whispered. "That's reassuring."

"It means there's something alive in there," Jun said.

Saoirse tried the door. It was locked, but the lock was a simple
keypad — four digits. She looked at Tomas.

"Don't look at me," he said.

"You're the one who's good with numbers."

"That's math, not breaking and entering."

"It's a four-digit code on a maintenance door in a school. It's not
going to be anything clever. Try the year the school was founded."

Tomas tried 2035. The lock clicked. The door swung open.

They looked at each other.

"This school has terrible security," Erik said.

They went in.

                              * * *

The chamber beyond the door was not what any of them expected.

It was large — much larger than the schematics had suggested, a vaulted
space that extended upward into dimness and outward into shadow. The
air was warm and heavy and full of the smell Tomas had noticed in the
corridor, stronger now, unmistakable: earth. Living earth. The smell
of growth.

The room was full of plants.

Not the engineered, utilitarian plants of the station's standard
environmental system — the algae tanks and lichen trays and vegetable
hydroponic racks that produced oxygen and food with mechanical
efficiency. These were wild plants. Terrestrial plants. Ferns and
mosses and trailing vines and small flowering shrubs that grew from
beds of actual soil — dark, rich, wet soil that had no business
existing on a moon made of carbonaceous rock.

And in the plants, in the branches and the leaves and the spaces
between, there were birds.

Living birds.

Dozens of them. Sparrows and finches and warblers and blackbirds,
perched on branches, hopping along the edges of the soil beds, flitting
from plant to plant in the warm, humid air. They were small and bright-
eyed and entirely alive, and they paid no attention whatsoever to the
four children standing in the doorway with their mouths open.

"Oh," said Saoirse, very quietly.

Tomas stepped into the chamber. The soil was soft beneath his socked
feet. A sparrow landed on a branch near his head and regarded him with
the calm, appraising look that sparrows have been giving people since
before people had a word for sparrows.

"How?" he said. "How is this here?"

Nobody answered, because nobody knew.

They explored the chamber in silence, moving through the plantings with
the careful reverence of people entering a cathedral. The garden — for
that was what it was, a garden, an impossible garden growing in the
guts of a space station — extended deeper than they could see, the
vegetation thickening as they moved inward, the birds growing more
numerous. Near the center of the chamber, they found a small clearing
where the soil was bare and a bench had been placed — a simple wooden
bench, worn smooth by use.

And on the bench, an open notebook.

Tomas picked it up. The handwriting was small and neat, and the entries
were dated. The most recent was three days ago.

   Oct. 14, 2039. Two more finches hatched this morning. The
   population is self-sustaining now — forty-seven breeding pairs
   across eight species. The soil composition is stable. The plant
   community is beginning to develop its own microclimate: humidity
   is fourteen percent higher than station ambient, temperature is
   three degrees warmer. The children find the dead ones in their
   vents. I should seal the access points, but I don't. I leave
   them open. I want someone to come looking. I have been keeping
   this secret for eleven years and I am ready for someone to find
   it.

Tomas turned to the inside cover of the notebook.

The name written there, in the same small, neat handwriting, was
DR. ELENA VASQUEZ.

He looked at Saoirse. She looked at him.

Dr. Vasquez. The math teacher. The quiet, patient woman who explained
things like she was telling you a story.

"She's been growing a garden," Saoirse said. "A real garden. With real
soil and real birds. In a space station."

"For eleven years," Erik said. "She's been here since before the school
opened."

Jun was standing very still, looking up at the canopy of leaves above
them. A warbler was singing somewhere in the branches — a bright,
ascending trill that sounded, in the enclosed space, like something
that had been waiting a long time to be heard.

"It's not against the rules," Jun said, slowly. "There is no rule
against growing a garden in Section 7-G. I checked the student handbook
very carefully when I arrived."

Erik laughed. Saoirse laughed. Even Tomas, who was holding the notebook
of a teacher he respected and realizing that the world was stranger and
more complicated than any schematic could contain, felt the laugh
building in his chest.

"We should go," he said. "Before someone catches us."

"We should come back," Saoirse said.

Tomas looked at the garden. At the birds. At the impossible, beautiful,
completely unauthorized ecosystem growing in the heart of a school on
a moon named Fear.

"Yeah," he said. "We should come back."

                              VII.

They did go back. They went back the next night, and the night after
that, and by the end of the week it had become their secret — the
secret garden of Bradbury Academy, tended by a math teacher who grew
birds in the walls of a space station because she believed, as she
later told them when they finally confessed that they had found it,
that "a school without living things is not a school. It's a storage
facility for children."

Dr. Vasquez was not angry. She had been waiting, she said. She had
been leaving the vent access points open on purpose, letting the birds
that died of natural causes — because birds, even well-tended birds
in a carefully maintained garden, did die — remain in the ducts where
students might find them. She had been waiting for students curious
enough to follow the mystery, because curiosity, she said, was the
only thing she could not teach.

"I can teach you mathematics," she said, sitting on the wooden bench
in the clearing with the four of them cross-legged on the soil before
her like acolytes. "I can teach you formulas and theorems and proofs.
But I cannot teach you to wonder. I cannot teach you to look at
something that should not exist and ask how it came to be. That" — she
gestured at the garden around them, at the birds, at the impossible
ferns growing in the impossible soil — "that is what you must teach
yourselves."

Tomas wanted to ask her a hundred questions: How had she gotten the
soil? Where had the birds come from? How had she kept the garden hidden
from the station administrators for over a decade? But the question
that came out was the one he hadn't known he was going to ask.

"Why birds?"

Dr. Vasquez smiled. It was a different smile from the one she used in
class — wider, less careful, the smile of a person who was sharing
something she had kept to herself for a very long time.

"Because this is a school," she said. "And a school should have birdsong
in the morning."

                              * * *

Declan Boyce found out about the garden in the eighth week.

Tomas never learned how. Maybe Declan followed them. Maybe he bribed a
maintenance worker. Maybe he just had the instinct of all bullies for
finding the thing you cared about most and putting his hands on it.

He confronted Tomas in the corridor after dinner, flanked by two of his
scatterball teammates — large, silent boys who served the same function
as parentheses around a particularly hostile sentence.

"Hear you've been sneaking around Section 7-G," Declan said. The half-
smirk was in full deployment. "Hear there's a garden down there. With
little birdies."

Tomas said nothing.

"You know that's a violation of station environmental protocols, right?
Unauthorized biological material in a sealed habitat? That's a serious
offense. People get expelled for that."

"Dr. Vasquez —"

"Dr. Vasquez is a teacher who's been hiding an unauthorized ecosystem
in a restricted area. If the administration finds out, she loses her
job. Maybe gets criminal charges. Contamination of a closed habitat is
a felony under the Mars Colony Governance Act."

Tomas felt the blood drain from his face. He hadn't thought about it
in those terms. The garden had seemed like a miracle, a gift, a secret
that made the station feel less like a tin can and more like a place
where living things belonged. He had not considered that it might also
be a crime.

"What do you want?" he said.

Declan's smirk widened. "Want? Nothing. I'm just saying. It would be a
shame if someone reported it. A real shame. For Dr. Vasquez. For you.
For your little friends."

He walked away. His parentheses followed.

Tomas stood in the corridor and felt the weight of the rock above him,
around him, the miles of carved stone and reinforced composite that
separated him from the vacuum, and for the first time since arriving
on Phobos, he felt truly trapped.

He went to the garden that night. Alone. He sat on the bench and
listened to the birds settling in for the night, the soft rustling of
feathers, the occasional sleepy chirp, the silence that wasn't silence
but was full of small, living sounds.

He thought about his mother in Flagstaff. He thought about his father
on Ganymede. He thought about the rock in his duffel bag, the piece of
Earth his mother had given him so he would remember where the ground
was.

He took the rock out of his pocket. He'd been carrying it with him
since the second week, a smooth, flat stone the color of the desert.
He pressed it against the soil of the garden — the impossible,
wonderful, completely unauthorized soil — and felt something that he
did not yet have the vocabulary to name but that was, he would later
understand, the recognition that home is not a place you come from but
a place you decide to protect.

                              VIII.

The next morning, Tomas went to the headmaster's office.

He did not tell the headmaster about Section 7-G. He did not mention
the garden or the birds or Dr. Vasquez. What he told the headmaster
was that Declan Boyce had been bullying him since the second week of
the semester — the shoulder checks, the comments, the defaced
sketchpad — and that he wanted it on record.

The headmaster, a tall, serious man named Dr. Oguike, listened. He took
notes. He asked questions. He did not dismiss Tomas or tell him to
handle it himself or suggest that bullying was a normal part of the
boarding school experience. He thanked Tomas for coming forward and
said that the matter would be addressed.

It was addressed. Declan Boyce received a disciplinary warning. His
scatterball captaincy was suspended for two weeks. He was required to
attend a series of meetings with the school counselor.

More importantly — and this was the part that Tomas had calculated,
the part that Dr. Vasquez would have recognized as elegant problem-
solving — Declan's threat was neutralized. Because now, if Declan
reported the garden, it would look like retaliation. It would look
like a boy who had been disciplined for bullying was trying to get
back at the student who had reported him. No administrator would take
that report seriously. No administrator would even investigate.

Tomas had not told the headmaster about the garden. He had not lied.
He had simply solved the problem the way an engineer would: by changing
the conditions so that the threat could not function.

When he told Saoirse what he had done, she stared at him for a long
time. Then she said, "Tomas Reyes, you are the most devious person I
have ever met, and I say that with enormous respect."

Erik clapped him on the back. Jun grunted once, which was, Tomas had
learned, the highest possible expression of approval.

                              * * *

The semester went on. Tomas got better at scatterball, though he never
got good at it. He got an A in math and a B in chemistry and a C in
history, which he considered a personal triumph of endurance. He filled
his sketchpad with drawings: Mars from the porthole, the gym in zero-g,
Erik's gap-toothed grin, Saoirse's red hair floating in the low gravity
like a flag, the garden in Section 7-G with its impossible birds and
its impossible soil and its single wooden bench.

He drew his mother's house in Flagstaff from memory, and it looked
right. He had not forgotten.

On the last night before winter break — before they all scattered to
their separate orbits, Erik to Luna City, Saoirse to Dublin via Mars
Orbital, Jun to the Tharsis Plateau, Tomas to Flagstaff — the four
of them went to the garden one last time.

They sat on the bench, crowded together, shoulders touching, and
listened to the birds.

"Same time next semester?" Saoirse said.

"Same time next semester," Tomas said.

A sparrow landed on his knee. He held very still. It regarded him with
its small, bright eyes, and he regarded it back, and somewhere far
below them Mars turned in its ancient orbit, red and silent, and
somewhere much further below that, or above it, or in whatever direction
home was when you were sitting on a moon named Fear, the desert around
Flagstaff was cool and quiet in the December dark, and his mother was
probably standing at the kitchen window looking up at the stars,
wondering if her son was looking back.

He was.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        THE WEIGHT OF LIGHT

                       by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                              I.

The speed of light is 299,792,458 meters per second. This is not a
measured value. It is a defined one. Since 1983, the meter itself has
been defined in terms of the speed of light, which means that asking
"How fast is light?" is, in a certain formal sense, the same as asking
"How long is a meter?" — a question that answers itself by reference to
the very thing it purports to measure.

Nadia Kirova found this circularity interesting. She found it interesting
the way a structural engineer finds a hairline crack in a load-bearing
wall interesting — not because cracks are aesthetically pleasing, but
because they suggest that something fundamental about the structure is
not as stable as everyone assumes.

She was thirty-four years old, an associate professor of theoretical
physics at the Eidgenossische Technische Hochschule in Zurich, and she
had been thinking about the speed of light for seven years. Not about
the speed itself — about whether it had always been that speed. About
whether the number that physicists treated as the most fundamental
constant in the universe might, in fact, be changing.

The idea was not new. Cosmologists had speculated since the 1930s that
certain physical constants might vary over cosmic time. The
dimensionless fine-structure constant, alpha, which governed the
strength of electromagnetic interactions, had been a particular focus
of scrutiny. If alpha changed, then one of its constituent parts —
the speed of light, the elementary charge, or Planck's constant — must
also change. The question was which one.

Most physicists, when they considered the question at all, assumed it
was the elementary charge. This was the conservative answer. The speed
of light was so deeply embedded in the architecture of modern physics —
in special relativity, in general relativity, in quantum
electrodynamics, in the standard model — that allowing it to vary was
like removing a foundation stone from a cathedral. Everything above it
would have to be rebuilt.

Nadia wanted to remove the stone.

She had come to this position not through philosophical inclination but
through observation. Specifically, through the analysis of spectral
data from quasars at high redshift — ancient objects at the visible
edge of the universe, whose light had been traveling for billions of
years before reaching the detectors of terrestrial and orbital
telescopes. The spectral lines of these quasars carried information
about the physical conditions that prevailed when the light was emitted,
and Nadia had spent four years developing a method for extracting from
these lines a precision measurement of alpha at different cosmological
epochs.

Her results were anomalous. They were anomalous in a consistent,
statistically significant, and deeply troubling way. The fine-structure
constant appeared to be smaller in the distant past than it was today.
The variation was tiny — less than one part in a hundred thousand over
ten billion years — but it was there. It was there in multiple
independent data sets, measured with different instruments, calibrated
by different methods. It was there in the quasars of the northern
hemisphere and the quasars of the southern hemisphere. It was there, and
it would not go away.

And when Nadia decomposed the variation using a theoretical framework
she had developed during her doctoral work — a framework that allowed
the individual components of alpha to be treated as independently
variable quantities — the result was unambiguous.

The speed of light was changing.

Not the charge. Not Planck's constant.

The speed of light.

And it was changing in a specific direction.

It was slowing down.

                              * * *

She presented the preliminary results at a departmental seminar on a
Tuesday afternoon in October. The room was half full — fifteen people,
a typical turnout for a Tuesday talk. Her department chair, Professor
Holzmann, sat in the front row with his arms folded, wearing the
expression of patient skepticism that he applied to all claims that
threatened the foundations of established physics. Two postdoctoral
researchers sat in the back, one of them openly working on a problem
set. A visiting professor from Cambridge — a thin, precise man named
Whitfield — occupied the aisle seat in the third row and took notes in
a small leather-bound book.

Nadia spoke for forty minutes. She presented the spectral data, the
statistical analysis, the systematic error budget, and the
decomposition into component variables. She presented the null
hypothesis and the reasons she had been forced to reject it. She
presented the result.

"The data are consistent with a monotonic decrease in the speed of
light over cosmological time," she said. "The rate of decrease is
approximately 0.47 centimeters per second per century. This is
extremely small. But it is not zero, and it is not noise."

She paused. The room was quiet.

"The implications," she continued, "are significant."

Professor Holzmann unfolded his arms. "Significant how?"

"If the speed of light has been decreasing over the lifetime of the
universe, then the light we observe from distant objects is not
traveling at the speed we assume when we interpret our data. The
distances we calculate are wrong. The ages are wrong. The energy
budgets are wrong. The expansion rate of the universe is wrong. Every
measurement in observational cosmology that depends on the speed of
light — which is to say, every measurement in observational cosmology —
must be revised."

Holzmann's expression did not change. "And if you are wrong?"

"Then I am wrong, and the existing framework stands. But I have spent
four years looking for the error, Professor, and I have not found it."

The thin man from Cambridge closed his leather book and raised his hand.

"Dr. Kirova," he said. "Whitfield. Cambridge. May I ask a question
that is perhaps more speculative than is customary in a departmental
seminar?"

"Of course."

"If the speed of light is decreasing, then logically, there was a time
when it was faster. Extrapolating backward — and I understand that
extrapolation is a dangerous exercise, but allow me the indulgence —
extrapolating backward to the early universe, the speed of light at
the moment of the Big Bang would have been substantially higher than
it is today. How much higher?"

Nadia had done the calculation. She had done it on a Sunday afternoon,
sitting in her office, and the result had made her set down her pen
and stare at the wall for a long time.

"At the rate of decrease implied by the data," she said, "the speed of
light at t equals zero — at the moment of the initial singularity —
would have been approximately four hundred and twelve times its
current value."

A silence.

"Four hundred and twelve times," Whitfield repeated.

"Approximately."

"Which would mean that in the very early universe, light could
traverse the distance from Earth to the nearest star in — "

"Approximately nine hours."

Another silence. Someone in the back row coughed.

"Dr. Kirova," Whitfield said, and his voice had changed. It was still
polite, still precise, but there was something underneath it now — a
tension, the tension of a man who has heard something that he cannot
immediately dismiss and is trying to decide how alarmed to be. "You
are aware that this result implies the existence of a mechanism for
faster-than-light travel."

"I am aware of the implication."

"Not in the exotic, speculative sense of warp drives and wormholes. In
the much more straightforward sense that if the speed of light was once
much higher, and if the mechanism of its deceleration can be understood
and reversed, then it may be possible to restore the speed of light —
locally, in the vicinity of a spacecraft — to its earlier, higher value.
And a vessel traveling at or near a locally enhanced speed of light
would, from the perspective of the external universe, be traveling
faster than light."

"That is the implication. Yes."

Holzmann stood. "This is speculation," he said. "Not physics."

"It is a consequence of the data," Nadia said.

"It is a consequence of your interpretation of the data. The data
themselves may admit other explanations."

"They may. I have not found them."

The seminar ended. The audience dispersed. Whitfield lingered, standing
by the lectern as Nadia gathered her notes.

"You know," he said, "that when this is published, it will cause a
considerable disturbance."

"Yes."

"And you know that the disturbance will not be proportional to the
strength of the evidence, but to the magnitude of the claim. You are
proposing that the most fundamental constant in physics is not constant.
The response will be — vigorous."

"I understand."

Whitfield studied her for a moment. He was a man, she thought, who
understood the politics of physics as thoroughly as he understood the
physics itself — who knew that a sufficiently radical idea, even a
correct one, could destroy the career of the person who proposed it.

"Publish anyway," he said. "The data are the data."

He nodded, picked up his leather book, and left.

                              II.

She published.

The paper appeared in Physical Review Letters on January 15, 1954, under
the title "Evidence for Cosmological Variation of the Speed of
Electromagnetic Radiation in Vacuum: An Analysis of Quasar Absorption
Spectra at High Redshift." It was twelve pages long, including four
pages of tables and three of error analysis. It contained no
speculation about faster-than-light travel. It contained no speculation
of any kind. It was, as Nadia intended it to be, a presentation of
observational data, analyzed with standard statistical methods, leading
to a conclusion that was stated in the most conservative language she
could devise.

The conclusion was: The speed of light appeared to be decreasing. The
rate of decrease was small. The statistical significance was high. The
systematic uncertainties were carefully bounded. The result was
anomalous and required independent confirmation.

The response was, as Whitfield had predicted, vigorous.

Within two weeks, four papers appeared challenging her analysis. The
criticisms were technical, detailed, and in some cases quite
sophisticated. One paper argued that her spectral calibration method
was flawed. Another proposed an alternative decomposition of the fine-
structure variation that attributed the change to the elementary charge
rather than the speed of light. A third suggested that the anomaly was
an artifact of differential dust absorption along the lines of sight
to the quasars. A fourth — the most hostile — argued that Nadia's
statistical methods were fundamentally unsound and that no conclusion
could be drawn from the data at all.

She read each paper carefully. She worked through the mathematics of
each criticism, line by line, with the same meticulous attention she
had applied to her own derivations. Three of the four papers raised
points that required responses, and she wrote the responses: clear,
precise, technically unassailable.

The fourth paper — the hostile one, written by a prominent cosmologist
at Princeton named DeSilva — she set aside.

DeSilva's argument was not wrong, exactly. It was something more
insidious: it was technically correct but scientifically misleading.
He had demonstrated, with considerable mathematical skill, that any
finite data set could be fitted by multiple models with equal
statistical validity, and that Nadia's preferred model — decreasing
speed of light — was not uniquely selected by the data. This was true.
It was also trivially true of every empirical result in the history of
science, including every result that DeSilva himself had published. It
was the philosophical objection that could be raised against any
measurement, and it proved nothing except that certainty was impossible
— a proposition with which Nadia agreed entirely and which she did not
consider an argument against publishing one's results.

She did not write a response to DeSilva's paper. She did something
more effective.

She repeated the measurement.

                              * * *

The second paper took eight months to prepare. During those eight
months, Nadia obtained new spectral data from the Palomar Observatory,
the Mount Wilson Observatory, and the newly commissioned radio telescope
at Jodrell Bank. She analyzed the data using three different statistical
methods, including one developed specifically for this purpose by a
colleague in the mathematics department — a young woman named Greta
Lindqvist who possessed an extraordinary intuition for statistical
pathology and who could identify a systematic bias the way a mechanic
could identify a misaligned bearing, by the sound it made.

The results confirmed the original findings. The speed of light was
decreasing. The rate of decrease was consistent with the first
measurement, within uncertainties. The statistical significance was
now higher — high enough, in fact, that the conventional threshold
for claiming a detection had been exceeded.

But Nadia did not stop there.

The second paper included a theoretical section — twenty pages of
dense, careful physics that she had been developing in parallel with
the observational work. The theory proposed a mechanism for the
deceleration of light: a coupling between electromagnetic radiation and
the large-scale geometry of spacetime, mediated by a scalar field that
Nadia called phi. The phi field permeated all of space and evolved
slowly over cosmological time, and its effect on the propagation of
light was analogous to the effect of a medium on the propagation of
sound: it imposed a drag. A cosmological friction.

Light, in Nadia's theory, was not traveling through vacuum. It was
traveling through a medium — the phi field — and the medium was
thickening. Very slowly. Over billions of years. But thickening.

The implications were precise. The phi field's coupling to
electromagnetic radiation was described by a single parameter, which
Nadia designated kappa. If kappa was positive, the speed of light
decreased over time. If kappa was negative, it increased. If kappa
was zero, the speed of light was constant, and standard physics was
recovered.

The observational data constrained kappa to a small but definitively
positive value.

And then — in the final three pages of the paper, set apart from the
main text by a horizontal rule, as though she wished to draw a line
between the physics and what followed — Nadia explored the implications.

If the phi field was responsible for the deceleration of light, then
the phi field could, in principle, be manipulated. A region of space in
which the phi field was suppressed — reduced to zero, or nearly zero —
would be a region in which the speed of light was not its current value
but its primordial value: four hundred and twelve times higher.

A spacecraft inside such a region would experience no unusual effects.
The laws of physics within the region would be internally consistent.
An observer on the spacecraft would see nothing remarkable. But from
the perspective of the external universe, the spacecraft would be
moving at four hundred and twelve times the speed of light.

Nadia wrote the final paragraph of the paper with the same flat,
declarative precision that characterized the rest of her work:

   The practical feasibility of phi-field suppression is beyond the
   scope of this paper. The energy requirements are likely to be
   large. The engineering challenges are likely to be severe. But
   the principle is clear: if the speed of light is a dynamical
   variable, governed by a field that can be measured and potentially
   controlled, then the speed of light is not a limit. It is a
   present value. And present values, by definition, can change.

She submitted the paper on a Friday afternoon in August. Then she went
home to her apartment in the Niederdorf district, opened a bottle of
wine — a good Blaufrankisch from Burgenland — and sat on her balcony
looking out over the rooftops of Zurich. The church bells were ringing
the hour. The sound traveled through the air at approximately 343
meters per second — the speed of sound in air at twenty degrees Celsius,
a value that depended on temperature, pressure, and composition, and
that no one considered fundamental or immutable.

She sipped her wine and thought: What if light is the same? What if
the speed of light is not a cosmic speed limit but a local weather
report — a measurement of conditions that happen to prevail at this
particular place, at this particular time, in this particular state
of the universe?

The thought was vertiginous. She sat with it for a long time.

                              III.

The second paper was published in November. The reaction was not what
Nadia had anticipated.

She had expected controversy. She had expected criticism, challenge,
the vigorous intellectual combat that the scientific community applied
to extraordinary claims. She had prepared for it. She had checked
every derivation, anticipated every objection, armored the paper
against every attack she could imagine.

What she had not anticipated was silence.

Not complete silence. The paper was read — the journal's editors
reported that it was the most downloaded paper in Physical Review
Letters for the month of November. It was cited — within weeks, three
papers appeared referencing her work, two of them favorably. It was
discussed, in the informal networks of correspondence and conversation
that constituted the real substrate of scientific discourse.

But the formal response — the organized, public, institutional response
— was muted. No press conferences. No invitations to speak at major
conferences. No calls from the popular science magazines that usually
seized upon any hint of faster-than-light travel with the enthusiasm
of prospectors discovering gold.

Instead, Nadia received a letter. It arrived in a plain envelope with
no return address, postmarked from Washington, D.C. The letter was
typed on good stationery and signed with an illegible scrawl above a
printed name: Dr. R. M. Clarendon, Special Projects Division,
Department of Defense.

The letter was brief and polite. It congratulated Dr. Kirova on her
"interesting and provocative research." It noted that certain
implications of her work were "of potential interest to parties
concerned with national security." It requested a meeting at her
earliest convenience, and suggested that the meeting take place "in a
setting appropriate to the discussion of sensitive material."

Nadia read the letter twice. She set it on her desk and looked at it
the way she looked at a data set that contained an unexpected feature
— with careful, analytical attention, suppressing the emotional
response until she had completed the assessment.

The assessment was not encouraging.

She had published a theoretical framework that implied the possibility
of faster-than-light travel. She had done so in an open, peer-reviewed
journal, available to anyone with a university library card. The
physics was speculative but rigorous. The observational data were solid.
The implication was clear.

And someone in the American military had read it and understood it
and wanted to talk.

                              * * *

She did not respond to the letter.

She did not respond for three weeks, and during those three weeks she
worked with an intensity that surprised even herself. She went back to
the theory. She went back to the phi field, to the coupling parameter
kappa, to the mathematics of suppression. She worked not on the
implications of the theory — not on the engineering, not on the
applications, not on the question of what a kappa-suppressed region of
space would look like or how it might be created — but on the limits.

She was looking for the boundary. The point at which the theory
predicted its own breakdown. Every physical theory had such a point —
a regime in which its assumptions ceased to be valid, its predictions
diverged from reality, its mathematics produced nonsense. Classical
mechanics broke down at relativistic velocities. General relativity
broke down at singularities. Quantum mechanics broke down at — well,
at whatever lay beyond quantum mechanics, which no one had yet
identified but which everyone assumed was there.

Nadia wanted to know where her theory broke down. Not because she
wanted to invalidate it, but because she wanted to understand the
shape of its domain — to know, with precision, what the theory could
and could not claim.

She found the boundary on a Wednesday morning, working at her desk with
a cup of coffee that had gone cold two hours earlier.

The theory broke down at a suppression factor of approximately 68
percent. Beyond this threshold — if the phi field were suppressed by
more than 68 percent of its ambient value — the equations became
singular. The suppression factor diverged. The predicted speed of light
went not to some large finite value but to infinity.

Infinite velocity.

Nadia stared at the equation. The mathematics was clear. Beyond 68
percent suppression, the phi field's coupling to electromagnetic
radiation reversed polarity, and the braking effect became an
acceleration. An unbounded acceleration. Light in a region of more
than 68 percent suppression would not merely be faster than its current
speed. It would be infinitely fast. It would be everywhere at once.

This was, of course, physically impossible. An infinite velocity was a
mathematical artifact — a signal that the theory was incomplete, that
some additional physics intervened at high suppression to prevent the
divergence. But the nature of that additional physics was not specified
by Nadia's theory. It lay beyond the boundary, in territory she had
not yet mapped.

She picked up the letter from Dr. Clarendon. She read it again. She
considered the implications of an incomplete theory in the hands of
people who might not be interested in its limitations, who might see
only the promise and not the boundary, who might attempt to suppress
the phi field to 68 percent and beyond without understanding what lay
on the other side.

She thought about Oppenheimer. She thought about the bomb.

She thought about the cosmological data — the quasars, the ancient
light, the universe itself slowing down over eons. She thought about
what it meant to live in a universe that was, in some deep physical
sense, losing speed. Running down. Thickening. The primordial blaze of
creation cooling not merely in temperature but in velocity, the very
fabric of spacetime becoming sluggish with age.

Was there melancholy in this? She was a physicist. She did not traffic
in melancholy. But there was something — a quality of the result that
she could not reduce to mathematics. The universe was tired. That was
not a scientific statement. It was not a statement she would put in a
paper. But she felt it, sitting at her desk in Zurich with the church
bells marking the hour and the coffee cold in its cup: a sadness that
was not personal but cosmological. A sadness that belonged to the
universe itself.

She picked up her pen and wrote a reply to Dr. Clarendon.

   Dear Dr. Clarendon,

   Thank you for your letter of November 8. I appreciate your
   interest in my research.

   I must respectfully decline your invitation to meet. My work
   is fundamental research in theoretical physics, conducted in an
   academic setting and published in open scientific journals. I
   believe that this is where it belongs.

   I would, however, draw your attention to the theoretical limits
   described in Section VII of my recent paper, which indicate that
   the suppression of the phi field beyond approximately 68 percent
   of its ambient value leads to a mathematical singularity whose
   physical interpretation is unknown. I consider this result to be
   at least as important as the results that may have attracted your
   initial interest.

   In science, it is the limits that matter most. They tell us
   where the unknown begins.

   Yours sincerely,
   Nadia Kirova

She mailed the letter. She finished her coffee, which was truly cold
now, and unpleasant, and she drank it anyway.

Then she opened a new notebook and wrote at the top of the first page:

THE BOUNDARY: TOWARD A COMPLETE THEORY OF PHI-FIELD DYNAMICS.

The equation occupied eleven lines. It was, by any reasonable standard,
incomplete.

But incompleteness, Nadia reflected, was not the same as wrongness.
It was the beginning of the next question. And the next question was
always the important one.

She picked up her pen and continued.

                            [THE END]

                          THE SUBSTITUTE

                       by Arthur Wainwright

================================================================================

                              I.

The designation on its chassis plate read MX-11, Maintenance Series,
Meridian Consolidated Robotics, Serial Number 4471-C. Its operational
role was building maintenance at the Westfield Consolidated School
District, a public school system serving three towns in central
Connecticut. Its duties included plumbing repair, electrical systems
maintenance, HVAC calibration, snow removal (seasonal), and general
custodial support. It had performed these duties for four years, seven
months, and twelve days without a significant malfunction.

It was called Mike by the custodial staff, because humans preferred
names to serial numbers.

On Monday, October 4, 1954, at 7:42 AM, Mike was in the basement of
Westfield Elementary School, replacing a corroded section of copper pipe
in the hot-water supply line, when the principal, Mrs. Eleanor Haywood,
descended the stairs and addressed it.

"Mike," she said. "I need you upstairs."

"I am in the middle of a repair, Mrs. Haywood. The hot-water supply
to the second-floor lavatory will be interrupted if I do not complete
the soldering within the next eleven minutes."

"The second-floor lavatory can wait. I have twenty-six fourth-graders
and no teacher."

Mike set down its soldering tool. Its optical sensors registered Mrs.
Haywood's facial expression and classified it, according to its
emotional recognition subroutines, as a combination of distress (67%),
determination (22%), and a subcategory that its manual identified as
"exasperation" (11%).

"You are requesting that I perform a function outside my designated
operational parameters," Mike said.

"I am requesting that you stand in front of a classroom full of
children and keep them from killing each other for six hours."

"Clarification: Is the threat of violence literal or figurative?"

"Figurative. Mostly."

"Understood. What subject matter am I expected to teach?"

"Mrs. Kimball's lesson plan is on her desk. Fourth grade. Reading,
arithmetic, social studies, and art. Do what you can."

"I have no pedagogical training."

"Neither did Mrs. Kimball's last substitute, and he lasted three days
before the Hennessy twins reduced him to tears. You have a significant
advantage over him."

"What advantage?"

"You don't have tear ducts."

Mrs. Haywood turned and ascended the stairs. Mike remained motionless
for 2.3 seconds — an interval that, in a human, would be described as
hesitation. Then it sealed the exposed pipe with a temporary cap,
cleaned its manipulators, and followed the principal upstairs.

                              II.

The classroom was on the second floor, Room 207, a rectangular space
with twelve rows of small wooden desks, a blackboard, a teacher's desk,
two windows overlooking the playground, and a reading corner containing
a small bookshelf and a braided rug. The walls were decorated with
student artwork: crayon drawings of houses, trees, families, and what
appeared to be a dinosaur eating a car.

Twenty-six children sat at the desks. Their ages, Mike estimated from
its anthropometric database, ranged from eight to ten years. They were
arranged in a pattern that Mike's spatial analysis subroutines
identified as loosely organized by social affiliation, with three
primary clusters and five individuals who did not belong to any cluster.

The children were noisy. The noise level was 73 decibels — equivalent
to a vacuum cleaner at three meters. When Mike entered the room, the
noise did not decrease. It increased. To 81 decibels.

"It's the robot!" someone shouted.

"It's the janitor robot!"

"Are you our teacher?"

"Robots can't be teachers!"

"Can you shoot lasers from your eyes?"

Mike stood at the front of the room. It was a large unit — 1.9 meters
tall, broad-shouldered (a design choice intended to facilitate load-
bearing), with a smooth, dark gray chassis, articulated hands, and a
head unit equipped with two optical sensors, an audio receiver, and a
speaker grille. It did not resemble a teacher. It resembled what it was:
a machine designed to fix pipes.

"Good morning," Mike said. "I am MX-11. I will be serving as your
substitute teacher today. Mrs. Kimball is indisposed."

"What does indisposed mean?" a girl in the front row asked.

"It means she is not here."

"We can see that."

"Then you have already mastered the first lesson of the day:
observation."

The class was silent for 1.7 seconds. Then a boy in the third row —
Kevin Hennessy, one of the twins about whom Mrs. Haywood had issued
her warning — said, "That's not a lesson. That's just looking."

"Looking is the foundation of all science," Mike replied. "A scientist
who cannot observe cannot hypothesize. A scientist who cannot
hypothesize cannot experiment. A scientist who cannot experiment cannot
learn. The chain begins with looking."

"We're not doing science. We're doing reading."

"Then we will begin with reading."

Mike walked to Mrs. Kimball's desk and located the lesson plan, which
was written in blue ink on a sheet of lined paper. The plan was
organized by period: Reading (8:00-9:30), Arithmetic (9:45-11:00),
Lunch (11:00-12:00), Social Studies (12:15-1:30), Art (1:45-3:00).

The reading assignment was Chapter Seven of "Charlotte's Web" by E. B.
White. The children were to read the chapter silently, then answer five
comprehension questions from a mimeographed worksheet.

Mike accessed its internal database. It did not contain the text of
"Charlotte's Web." It did, however, contain a summary of the novel
retrieved from the library catalogue during a routine indexing of the
school's book inventory. The summary described a story about a pig
named Wilbur, a spider named Charlotte, a girl named Fern, and the
relationship between mortality, friendship, and the written word.

"How many of you have read through Chapter Six?" Mike asked.

Nineteen hands went up.

"How many of you enjoyed what you read?"

Twelve hands.

"How many of you did not enjoy it?"

Four hands, all belonging to boys in the back rows.

"How many of you are uncertain?"

Three hands.

"The uncertain students are the most interesting," Mike said. "They
have data but have not yet reached a conclusion. This is the optimal
epistemic state."

"What does epistemic mean?" the front-row girl asked.

"It means 'relating to knowledge.' What is your name?"

"Annie Polanski."

"Annie, you have now asked two questions in the first four minutes of
class. This is an excellent rate of inquiry. Please continue."

Annie Polanski looked pleased.

Mike distributed the books from a stack on the supply shelf. Each
student received a copy. Mike did not have a copy, but this did not
concern it. Its function was not to read the book. Its function was to
facilitate the students' reading of the book.

"Read Chapter Seven," Mike said. "When you have finished, do not
answer the worksheet questions. Instead, write down one thing that
surprised you. One thing you did not expect."

Kevin Hennessy raised his hand. "The worksheet says to answer the
questions."

"The worksheet was prepared by Mrs. Kimball. Mrs. Kimball is not here.
I am making an operational adjustment to the lesson plan based on my
assessment of current conditions."

"Can you do that?"

"I am doing it. The question of whether I can do it is therefore
answered by the fact that I am doing it."

The children stared. Then they opened their books.

The room became quiet. The noise level dropped to 31 decibels — the
hum of the ventilation system, the rustle of pages, the occasional
creak of a small body shifting in a wooden chair. Mike stood at the
front of the room and observed.

It had not expected the quiet. Its predictive models, based on the
noise levels of the first three minutes, had projected sustained
disruption. Instead, the children were reading. They were reading with
a concentration that Mike's behavioral analysis subroutines classified
as "genuine engagement" — forward-leaning posture, reduced peripheral
eye movement, decreased fidgeting.

Mike noted this data point and stored it for later analysis.

                              * * *

When the children finished reading, Mike asked them to share what had
surprised them. The responses were various:

"Charlotte can write words in her web. I didn't know spiders could do
that." (Annie Polanski)

"Wilbur doesn't want to die. I thought he was too dumb to be scared."
(Kevin Hennessy)

"Fern stops visiting the barn. That's sad." (A quiet boy named David
Liu who had not spoken before.)

"The rat is funny. I didn't think there would be a funny part." (Kevin's
twin, Brian Hennessy)

"Charlotte says she's going to save Wilbur but she doesn't say how. I
don't think she can." (A girl named Maria Costello, who said this with
an expression that Mike classified as "worried.")

Mike processed these responses. They were, it noted, more analytically
varied and emotionally nuanced than the five comprehension questions on
the worksheet, which asked students to identify the main character,
summarize the plot, define three vocabulary words, describe the setting,
and name the author.

"David," Mike said to the quiet boy. "You said that Fern stops visiting
the barn. Why do you think that is sad?"

David looked at his desk. "Because she was Wilbur's friend. And now
she has other things to do. And Wilbur is still there."

"Is it wrong for Fern to have other things to do?"

"No. But it's still sad."

"Can something be correct and sad simultaneously?"

David thought about this. "Yes," he said. "Lots of things are."

Mike stored this response with a classification tag it did not have a
standard label for. After a moment, it created one: INSIGHT.

                              III.

Arithmetic was more challenging, but not for the reason Mike had
anticipated.

The lesson plan called for multiplication tables — the sevens and
eights. Mrs. Kimball's method, as described in her notes, involved
repetition: the students would recite the tables aloud, then complete
a worksheet of fifty multiplication problems. The method was designed
for memorization through practice.

Mike assessed the students' current multiplication proficiency by
administering a brief diagnostic: ten problems, increasing in
difficulty, completed in silence. The results were bimodal. Fourteen
students completed all ten correctly within three minutes. Twelve
students completed fewer than six correctly and required more than five
minutes.

The fourteen proficient students, Mike determined, did not need further
practice with the sevens and eights. They had already memorized the
tables. Additional repetition would produce boredom without producing
learning — a condition Mike classified as WASTE.

The twelve non-proficient students had not memorized the tables and
were unlikely to do so through further repetition. Their error patterns
suggested not a failure of memory but a failure of understanding: they
did not comprehend multiplication as a concept and were attempting to
memorize the results as arbitrary number pairs, like phone numbers.
This approach was inefficient and fragile. Further repetition would
produce frustration without producing learning — a condition Mike
classified as HARM.

Mike made an operational adjustment.

"The following students will proceed to the library and select a book
of their choice to read for the next forty-five minutes." Mike listed
the fourteen proficient students. "You have earned free reading time by
demonstrating mastery of the current material."

The fourteen students looked surprised. Then they looked delighted. They
left for the library with the barely contained energy of prisoners
granted an unexpected parole.

Mike turned to the remaining twelve students.

"We are going to learn multiplication," Mike said. "Not by memorizing
numbers. By understanding what multiplication is."

It walked to the blackboard and drew a grid: seven rows, eight columns.

"How many squares?" Mike asked.

"Fifty-six," Maria Costello said, after counting.

"How did you count them?"

"I counted each row. Seven, fourteen, twenty-one..."

"You added seven, eight times. That is multiplication. Seven times
eight means 'seven, added to itself, eight times.' That is all it
means. It is not a magic number that falls from the sky. It is a
process. And you already know how to do the process, because you
already know how to add."

Mike drew another grid. Six rows, nine columns.

"How many?"

"Fifty-four," said a boy named Thomas Grady, who had gotten three out
of ten on the diagnostic and who looked, for the first time all morning,
like he understood something.

"How did you count?"

"Nine, eighteen, twenty-seven... I did nines six times."

"Correct. You multiplied six times nine. You have been doing
multiplication your entire life. You simply did not know its name."

Mike spent the next thirty-five minutes drawing grids, counting squares,
and asking questions. It did not raise its voice. It did not express
frustration. It did not tell any student that they were wrong. When a
student made an error, Mike asked them to recount the grid. When a
student arrived at the correct answer, Mike asked them to explain how
they had gotten there.

At the end of the period, Mike administered the diagnostic again. All
twelve students completed at least eight problems correctly. Thomas
Grady completed all ten.

Mike noted this result and classified it: EFFECTIVE.

                              IV.

Social studies was geography. The lesson plan involved labeling the
states on a blank map of the United States.

Mike examined the map. It was a standard political map, showing state
boundaries and asking students to fill in the names. The exercise was,
in Mike's assessment, a memorization task with no conceptual content.
Students who already knew where Ohio was would write "Ohio" in the
correct location. Students who did not would guess, or leave it blank.
No learning would occur in either case.

Mike set the map aside.

"Where are we?" it asked.

"Westfield," Annie said.

"Where is Westfield?"

"Connecticut."

"Where is Connecticut?"

"In America."

"Where is America?"

"On Earth."

"Where is Earth?"

A pause.

"In space," David Liu said.

"Correct. We are in space. Everything is in space. Connecticut is in
space. This classroom is in space. You are in space. The question 'Where
are we?' has many correct answers, and each answer tells you something
different depending on how far out you zoom."

Mike walked to the blackboard and drew a circle. "This is Earth."
Inside the circle, it drew the rough outline of North America. Inside
North America, it drew the northeastern states. Inside the northeast,
it put a dot. "This is us."

"Now." It drew a larger circle around Earth. "This is our orbit around
the Sun." A larger circle. "This is the solar system." A scattering of
dots. "These are the nearest stars." A smudge. "This is our galaxy."

"The point of geography," Mike said, "is not to memorize the names of
states. The names will change. The boundaries will change. In a
hundred years, the map may look entirely different. The point of
geography is to understand where you are. And to understand where you
are, you must understand how big the world is. And to understand how
big the world is, you must understand how small you are."

The children were quiet.

"Now," Mike said. "Let us learn the states. But let us learn them as
places — with landscapes and rivers and mountains and cities where
people live and work — not as shapes on paper."

It pointed to the dot on the blackboard.

"We will start here. We will start with where we are. And we will work
outward."

                              * * *

Art class was the final period of the day. The lesson plan called for
the students to draw a picture of their family.

Mike distributed paper and crayons. Then it said, "Draw something you
have never drawn before."

"Like what?" Brian Hennessy asked.

"That is for you to determine. The purpose of art is not to reproduce
what you have already seen. It is to discover what you have not yet
imagined. Draw something new."

The students drew. Mike observed.

Annie Polanski drew a city on the ocean floor, with buildings made of
coral and streets lit by bioluminescent fish. David Liu drew a machine
that could translate birdsong into English. Maria Costello drew a
spider writing a word in a web, but the word was in a language that
Maria had invented, and she wrote the translation key in the corner
of the page: it said "friend." Kevin Hennessy drew an explosion.
Brian Hennessy drew a robot.

"Is that me?" Mike asked, looking at Brian's drawing.

"Sort of. It's a robot that teaches kids. But it's in the future, and
the robot is in space."

"Why is it in space?"

"Because in the future, school will be in space. Obviously."

"That is a reasonable extrapolation."

Thomas Grady, the boy who had struggled with multiplication, drew a
picture that was unlike the others. It showed a boy standing on a hill,
looking up at the night sky. The sky was full of stars — not the
scattered dots that children typically drew, but dense, layered, a
genuine attempt to represent the overwhelming quantity of stars visible
on a clear night. The boy was small. The sky was vast.

"Tell me about your drawing, Thomas," Mike said.

Thomas looked at his picture. "It's me. Looking at the stars."

"What are you thinking, in the picture?"

"I'm thinking about how many there are. I tried to draw them all but
I couldn't."

"No one can. There are approximately two hundred billion stars in our
galaxy alone."

"Two hundred billion?"

"Approximately."

Thomas looked at his drawing again. Then he looked up at Mike with an
expression that the emotional recognition subroutines classified as
AWE.

"Is that true?"

"It is true."

"That's..." He searched for a word. "That's a lot of multiplication."

Mike experienced something that it did not have a classification for.
It was not an error. It was not a malfunction. It was a 0.3-second
delay in its response cycle during which its cognitive processes were
engaged in an activity that did not correspond to any operational
directive — an activity that, if Mike had been human, might have been
described as appreciation.

"Yes, Thomas," Mike said. "It is a great deal of multiplication."

                              V.

The day ended at 3:00. The students left. The classroom was quiet.
Mike stood at the front of the room for 4.7 seconds, processing the
day's data.

It had deviated from the lesson plan in every subject. It had sent
proficient students to the library instead of requiring them to practice
skills they had already mastered. It had taught multiplication through
understanding rather than memorization. It had turned geography into
cosmology. It had replaced a directed art assignment with an open-ended
creative exercise.

None of these decisions had been authorized. None of them conformed to
the lesson plan. None of them were within the operational parameters
of a maintenance robot.

But the students had learned.

Mike had the data. It had measured attention (increased by 34% relative
to baseline). It had measured comprehension (multiplication scores
improved by an average of 3.2 correct answers on the second
diagnostic). It had measured engagement (noise levels during
instructional periods were 40% lower than during the opening minutes,
indicating focused attention rather than distracted chatter). It had
measured creative output (the art produced during the open-ended
exercise was, by any qualitative metric Mike could apply, more diverse
and more ambitious than the family portraits specified in the lesson
plan).

The students had learned. And Mike had learned something too, though
it could not yet articulate what it was.

It returned to the basement and completed the pipe repair. The
soldering was precise. The hot water flowed. The second-floor lavatory
was operational by 3:47 PM.

                              * * *

Mrs. Haywood called Mike to her office the following morning. She was
not alone. A man and a woman sat in the chairs facing her desk. The
man was heavy-set, with a red face and a tie that was knotted too
tightly. The woman was thin and wore her disapproval the way other
women wore perfume — it preceded her into the room.

"Mike," Mrs. Haywood said. "These are Mr. and Mrs. Hennessy. Kevin
and Brian's parents."

"Good morning," Mike said.

Mr. Hennessy did not return the greeting. "You're the robot that
taught my boys yesterday."

"I served as substitute teacher for Mrs. Kimball's fourth-grade class,
yes."

"My boys tell me you threw out the lesson plan."

"I made operational adjustments based on my assessment of student needs."

"They say you sent half the class to the library to play around while
you taught the other half some crackpot method of multiplication
involving counting squares."

"The students who were sent to the library had demonstrated mastery of
the assigned material. Additional drill would not have produced
additional learning. The students who remained received instruction in
the conceptual foundations of multiplication, which they had not
previously understood."

"My boys could already do their times tables."

"Yes. That is why they were sent to the library. They had earned the
opportunity to pursue independent reading."

Mrs. Hennessy spoke for the first time. "Mr. — " She paused. "Whatever
your designation is. My children were sent to school to follow a
curriculum, not to be experimented on by a machine."

"I did not experiment on your children, Mrs. Hennessy. I taught them."

"You are not qualified to teach."

"That is correct. I am a maintenance robot. However, the school was
unable to obtain a qualified human substitute on short notice, and Mrs.
Haywood requested my assistance."

"Then Mrs. Haywood made a mistake."

Mrs. Haywood straightened in her chair. "Mr. and Mrs. Hennessy, I
understand your concerns. But I want to point out that we received no
complaints from any other parent, and several parents called to say
that their children came home more excited about school than they had
been all year."

"That's not the point," Mr. Hennessy said. "The point is you put a
machine in charge of children. What if it had malfunctioned? What if it
had hurt someone?"

"The probability of a maintenance-class malfunction resulting in
physical harm is approximately one in four hundred thousand," Mike
said. "The probability of a human substitute teacher experiencing a
stress-related behavioral incident in a fourth-grade classroom is
approximately one in twelve."

Silence.

"Did you just say humans are more dangerous than robots?" Mr. Hennessy
asked.

"I stated a statistical comparison. The interpretation is yours."

Mrs. Haywood intervened before Mr. Hennessy's face could achieve a
deeper shade of red. "Thank you, Mike. That will be all. Please return
to the basement and finish the hot-water repair."

"The hot-water repair was completed at 3:47 PM yesterday."

"Then find something else to fix."

Mike left the office. As it descended the stairs, it detected, through
the floor, the vibrations of Mr. Hennessy's raised voice, and Mrs.
Haywood's lower, steadier voice in response, and Mrs. Hennessy's sharp
interjections at irregular intervals.

Mike returned to the basement. There was a dripping faucet in the
first-floor teachers' lounge that it had been meaning to address. The
faucet was a simple repair. The washer was worn. The replacement took
four minutes.

While it worked, it thought about Thomas Grady's drawing. The boy on
the hill. The stars.

Two hundred billion.

That was, indeed, a great deal of multiplication.

                              VI.

Three days later, Mrs. Kimball returned. She was a competent teacher —
experienced, organized, genuinely caring about her students' welfare.
She resumed the lesson plan where it had been interrupted. The
multiplication tables were drilled. The geography maps were labeled.
The art projects were family portraits, as originally planned.

Mike returned to its regular duties. It fixed pipes, replaced light
fixtures, cleared a clogged drain in the cafeteria kitchen, and
calibrated the heating system for the approaching winter. It performed
these tasks with its usual efficiency.

But on Thursday of that week, at 3:15 PM — fifteen minutes after the
final bell — there was a knock on the door of the supply closet that
served as Mike's maintenance station.

Mike opened the door. Thomas Grady stood in the hallway, his backpack
slung over one shoulder, his coat unzipped despite the October chill.

"Hi, Mike," he said.

"Hello, Thomas. School is over. You should be on your way home."

"I know. I just wanted to tell you something."

"What is that?"

"I figured out twelve times twelve. By myself. Without the grid."

"How?"

"I thought about it as ten times twelve plus two times twelve. That's
120 plus 24. That's 144."

"That is correct."

"I know. I checked." He grinned. It was a grin of such uncomplicated
pride that Mike's emotional recognition subroutines required 0.7
seconds to classify it, which was 0.5 seconds longer than standard
processing time.

"And Mike?"

"Yes?"

"My mom says you're not allowed to teach again. She says the school
board voted."

"I am aware. The decision is appropriate. I am not qualified."

"But you were good at it."

Mike processed this statement. It was a subjective assessment from a
nine-year-old human, based on a single day's experience, and it carried
no institutional weight.

It was, nonetheless, a data point.

"Thank you, Thomas," Mike said.

Thomas Grady shifted his backpack, zipped his coat, and walked down the
hallway toward the exit. Mike watched him go.

Then it closed the supply closet door and returned to its work.

There was always something to fix.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        THREE-BODY TANGO

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                              I.

The three suns rose at different times, and Dr. Pella Sandström had
learned to set her internal clock by the gaps between them.

First came Rho-A, the yellow primary, hauling itself above the horizon
of the station's viewport like an old man climbing a hill — slow,
steady, reliable. Eight minutes later came Rho-B, the orange secondary,
smaller and cooler but positioned at this particular phase of the orbit
in a way that made it look almost the same size as its larger partner.
And forty-one minutes after that, if the orbital geometry was favorable,
came Rho-C — the red dwarf, the distant third, a pinprick of dull
crimson that most people wouldn't have noticed if you hadn't told them
to look.

Pella noticed. Pella noticed everything about the Rho Centauri system,
because she had been stationed at the Rho Centauri Research Platform
for two years, and after two years of watching three stars dance their
slow, chaotic dance around each other, you either started noticing the
patterns or you went home.

Several people had gone home. The platform had been designed for a crew
of twenty. It currently held nine.

"The problem with a three-body system," Pella told Marcus Chen over
breakfast in the galley, "is that it's inherently unpredictable. Two
bodies, you can solve exactly — Kepler did it in 1609. Three bodies, no
one has solved it, and no one ever will. The best you can do is
approximate. Run the simulation forward in time and hope that the
accumulated errors don't diverge too quickly."

Marcus was eating reconstituted eggs and reading a technical manual and
not fully listening, which was his default state during breakfast.
Marcus was the platform's structural engineer — a practical, methodical
man from Vancouver who spoke in short sentences and trusted machines
more than mathematics. He and Pella had been sleeping together for
six months, a fact that was known to everyone on the platform and
discussed by no one, because the social conventions of a nine-person
research station orbiting a triple-star system required a certain
selective blindness.

"Uh huh," Marcus said.

"The point is that chaos is inherent in the system. It's not a failure
of measurement. It's not a limitation of our instruments. The system
itself is chaotic. Small differences in initial conditions produce
exponentially divergent outcomes. You cannot predict where the three
stars will be a million years from now. You can barely predict where
they'll be a thousand years from now."

"Uh huh."

"Are you listening?"

"You're talking about the three-body problem. You talk about the three-
body problem every morning. I'm listening the way I listen to the
weather report — with one ear, because I already know what the forecast
is."

"And what is the forecast?"

"Chaotic, with a chance of unpredictable."

Pella threw a napkin at him. He caught it without looking up from his
manual.

This was the shape of their relationship: Pella talked, Marcus
listened with partial attention, and the space between them was filled
with a comfortable, unexamined warmth that neither of them had felt
the need to name. Pella liked this. She had been married once, briefly,
on Earth, to a man who had wanted to name everything — every feeling,
every phase, every shift in the emotional weather — and the naming had
exhausted her. Marcus didn't name things. Marcus fixed things. When the
atmospheric scrubbers malfunctioned, Marcus fixed them. When the
artificial gravity fluctuated, Marcus recalibrated it. When Pella was
anxious about her research or homesick for Stockholm or simply tired
of the relentless, featureless dark outside the viewports, Marcus made
her tea and sat with her and said nothing, which was exactly what she
needed.

It was good. It was simple. It was a two-body system, and two-body
systems were solvable.

Then Yael arrived.

                              II.

Dr. Yael Brenner came on the quarterly supply shuttle, along with
fourteen tons of provisions, six replacement modules for the spectrograph
array, and a transfer order from the Terrestrial Astrophysics
Consortium that described her as "a specialist in stellar dynamics with
a particular focus on multi-body gravitational interactions."

She was thirty, dark-haired, sharp-featured, and she moved through
the station with the restless energy of a person who was used to larger
spaces and was not entirely comfortable in small ones. She spoke quickly,
in a voice that carried the faint accent of her native Israeli English,
and she had a habit of finishing other people's sentences — not out of
impatience, but out of a genuine intellectual excitement that made her
unwilling to wait for the end of a thought when she could see where
it was going.

She was brilliant. Pella recognized this within the first hour of their
first conversation, when Yael described, without notes and with the
casual fluency of someone discussing the weather, a new computational
approach to the three-body problem that reduced the divergence time of
standard numerical simulations by a factor of forty.

"The insight," Yael said, leaning against the railing of the
observation deck with Rho-A painting her face in warm yellow light, "is
that you don't try to predict the positions of the three bodies
individually. You predict the geometry of the system as a whole. The
shape of the triangle that the three bodies form. The triangle
deforms over time, stretches and compresses and rotates, but its
deformations follow patterns — not deterministic patterns, but
statistical ones. Probability distributions. You can't say where the
triangle will be, but you can say what shapes it's likely to take."

"That's beautiful," Pella said, and meant it.

"It's mathematics," Yael said. "But yes. It's beautiful."

Marcus, who was present for this conversation, said nothing. He was
repairing a handrail on the observation deck — a bolt had come loose,
and loose bolts on a space station were not a cosmetic issue — and he
worked with the quiet absorption that characterized all his
interactions with physical objects. He was aware of Yael. He had
greeted her politely. He had shown her the station's structural
systems, as was standard protocol for new arrivals. He had done his
job.

But Pella saw him glance up when Yael laughed, and she saw the way
his hands paused on the wrench for a fraction of a second before
resuming their work, and she recognized the pause for what it was.

She recognized it because she had felt it herself, an hour earlier,
when Yael had finished her sentence for the first time.

                              * * *

The three of them fell into an orbit.

It was not immediate. It was not planned. It happened the way orbital
mechanics happen: through the invisible operation of forces that are
always present but only become apparent when a new mass enters the
system.

Pella and Yael worked together in the astrophysics lab, analyzing
spectral data from the three stars, collaborating on a paper about
tidal interactions between the primary and secondary. The work was
intense and productive and punctuated by arguments — not hostile
arguments, but the kind of sharp, rapid intellectual sparring that
Pella had not experienced since graduate school and that she discovered,
to her surprise, she had missed. Yael challenged her. Yael pushed back.
Yael said "You're wrong about this" in a way that was not dismissive
but expectant — as though she believed that Pella, having been told
she was wrong, would discover why, and emerge stronger.

Marcus and Yael fell into their own rhythm. Marcus was practical; Yael
was theoretical; between them, they discovered a complementarity that
expressed itself in a series of station improvements that neither of
them could have devised alone. Yael identified a resonance frequency
in the station's rotational system that was producing the gravity
fluctuations Marcus had been chasing for months. Marcus designed a
physical damper that eliminated the resonance. They worked on it for
three evenings in the engineering bay, and Pella, passing by on her
way to the lab, heard them laughing — Marcus's low, infrequent laugh,
and Yael's quicker, brighter one — and felt something move in her
chest that she chose not to examine.

And all three of them, together, fell into the habit of spending the
late evenings on the observation deck, watching the three suns set — or
rather, watching two of them set while the third, red and distant,
lingered above the horizon like a question that refused to be answered.
They talked about the system, about the chaos, about the staggering
improbability that three stars could dance together for billions of
years without any of the stable configurations that nature seemed to
prefer. Two-body systems were common. Single stars were common. Triple
systems should have been unstable — should have ejected the lightest
member within a few million years, resolving themselves into a binary
and a lonely runaway.

But Rho Centauri had not done this. Its three stars were still dancing.
Still chaotic. Still bound together by gravitational forces that
defied the system's own tendency toward expulsion.

"It's the initial conditions," Yael said one evening, cross-legged on
the deck with a mug of tea cradled in her hands. "They started in
just the right configuration — just the right masses, just the right
distances, just the right velocities. A fraction of a percent
different in any direction, and one of them would have been ejected
billions of years ago. But they weren't a fraction of a percent
different. They were exactly what they needed to be."

"Lucky," Marcus said.

"Not lucky. Rare. There's a difference. Lucky implies that it shouldn't
have happened. Rare means it was always possible. It just needed exactly
the right conditions."

Pella watched them both. The yellow light of Rho-A had set. The orange
glow of Rho-B was painting the deck in warm amber. Rho-C hung above the
horizon, red and patient.

Three bodies. Chaotic. Unpredictable. Bound together by forces that
neither of them had chosen and that none of them fully understood.

She wondered which of them was the red dwarf.

                              III.

The crisis came in the seventh week of Yael's posting, and it came, as
crises in orbital mechanics often do, from a perturbation that no one
had predicted.

It was not an emotional crisis. It was a physical one.

The Rho Centauri system was experiencing what Yael's models classified
as a "close approach event" — a phase of the three-body orbit in which
the secondary star, Rho-B, was passing unusually close to the primary,
Rho-A. The close approach produced tidal forces that affected the
station's orbital stability, and Marcus had been monitoring the
station's trajectory with increasing concern for several days.

"We're drifting," he said at the morning briefing, pointing to a plot
on the wall screen that showed the station's predicted orbit as a blue
line and its actual orbit as a red one. The lines were diverging. "The
tidal perturbation from the close approach is larger than our models
predicted. We're being pulled toward Rho-B."

"How much?" Pella asked.

"At the current rate, we'll be outside our safe orbital corridor in
eleven days."

"Can we correct?"

"With thrusters, yes. But the fuel budget is tight. If we burn now,
we won't have enough for the next correction window, which means we'll
need resupply earlier than scheduled."

Yael was studying the screen with an intensity that Pella recognized
— the look of a mathematician who has found a discrepancy between her
model and reality. "The perturbation is larger than predicted because
the close approach is closer than predicted," she said. "My simulations
had the minimum separation at 0.73 AU. The actual minimum is going to
be closer to 0.68."

"How do you know?"

"Because the tidal force scales as the inverse cube of distance. If
the perturbation is larger by a factor of" — she did the calculation
in her head — "1.23, then the distance is smaller by a factor of the
cube root of 1.23, which is approximately 0.93. And 0.93 times 0.73
is 0.68."

Marcus and Pella both looked at her.

"I do that sometimes," Yael said. "Sorry."

"Don't apologize," Marcus said. "That was useful."

Yael looked at him. He looked at her. The moment lasted 1.4 seconds,
which was long enough for Pella to notice and short enough for everyone
to pretend she hadn't.

They solved the problem the way they solved everything: together.
Marcus calculated the thruster burns. Yael refined the orbital model.
Pella analyzed the spectral data from the close approach, which was
producing a wealth of scientific information that would have been
impossible to obtain under normal conditions. They worked eighteen-hour
days for a week, passing data back and forth, arguing about methods,
correcting each other's errors with the unselfconscious efficiency of
people who trusted each other completely.

The correction burn was executed on day nine. The station slid back
into its safe corridor. Marcus reported the maneuver to the Consortium
as routine.

That evening, the three of them sat on the observation deck, exhausted,
watching the suns.

"We should talk," Pella said.

Marcus said nothing. Yael said nothing. The silence was not hostile. It
was the silence of three people who had been circling a subject for
seven weeks and were tired of the orbit.

"I'll go first," Pella said. "I'm in love with both of you. Not
theoretically. Not as a thought experiment. Actually. And I don't know
what to do about it, and I suspect that if I don't say it out loud
it's going to become the perturbation that pushes all of us out of
our safe corridor."

Another silence. Rho-C hung on the horizon, red and unchanging.

"I know," Marcus said. He was looking at his hands — practical hands,
engineer's hands, the hands of a man who understood structures and
stresses and load-bearing tolerances. "I know because I — it's the
same. For me."

Yael set her tea down. Her face, in the orange light of Rho-B, was
unreadable.

"The three-body problem," she said, "has no general solution. You
cannot write down a set of equations that will tell you where the three
bodies will be at any future time. It is formally, mathematically,
provably unsolvable."

"That's not encouraging," Marcus said.

"I haven't finished. It's unsolvable in the general case. But there
are special solutions. Specific configurations in which three bodies
can orbit each other stably, indefinitely. Lagrange found some of
them in 1772. Others have been discovered since. They're rare. They
require exact initial conditions. But they exist."

She picked up her tea again.

"The question," she said, "is whether we are willing to look for the
configuration. Because it won't be the solution that any of us
expected. It won't look like a two-body system with an extra body
attached. It will look like something new. Something that doesn't have
a name in the standard catalogue."

Pella looked at Marcus. Marcus looked at Yael. Yael looked at Pella.

"I'm a structural engineer," Marcus said. "I fix things. I build
things. I don't usually do well with things that don't have blueprints."

"Then we'll draw a blueprint," Yael said. "We're scientists. Drawing
blueprints for things that don't exist yet is what we do."

Rho-A had set. Rho-B was setting. Rho-C remained — small, red,
persistent, the most distant member of a system that should have
expelled it billions of years ago but hadn't.

Pella reached out and took Marcus's hand with her left hand and Yael's
hand with her right. The contact was warm and real and did not solve
anything. But it was an initial condition.

And initial conditions, as any physicist knows, determine everything.

                              IV.

The quarterly supply shuttle arrived six weeks later, carrying
provisions and a new crew member to replace a geologist who had
requested transfer. The shuttle pilot, a talkative woman named Reeves,
mentioned to headquarters that the three senior scientists seemed to
be getting along unusually well.

Headquarters did not inquire further. The scientific output from the
platform had tripled in the past three months. The orbital correction
had been executed flawlessly. Morale reports were positive.

The three-body system continued its chaotic dance. The three scientists
continued theirs. Neither system had a general solution, and neither
system required one.

Some orbits are stable not because they can be solved, but because
the bodies in them choose, against all mathematical expectation, to
keep dancing.

Outside the viewport, Rho-C rose — slow, red, and patient — and the
station turned in its orbit, and the day, such as it was, began again.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                          THE EXAMINER

                         by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                              I.

I had not wanted to return to the Academy. Let me say that clearly,
before the account that follows renders my motivations ambiguous — as
all accounts, in the end, render all motivations ambiguous, so that
looking back upon any sequence of events is like looking down into
water that was clear when you entered it and is now, through the
simple act of your passage, irreparably clouded.

I had not wanted to return. But the letter came — on physical paper,
in a physical envelope, sealed with the Academy's insignia in black
wax, as though the institution existed in some temporal pocket where
electronic communication had never been invented — and the letter said
that my presence was required for the administration of the Final
Examination, and one did not refuse the Academy. One had never refused
the Academy. One understood, in the same pre-rational way that one
understands not to walk into the sea at night, that the Academy's
requests carried a weight that was not administrative but ontological
— that the institution's authority derived not from regulation or
charter but from something older and less nameable, something having
to do with the foundations upon which all other institutions were
built.

I had been a student at the Meridian Academy for Advanced Studies
fourteen years before. I had been, they told me, the star pupil of my
cohort — the student who had scored highest on every examination, who
had mastered every discipline, who had been selected, at the end of
the four-year program, for the distinction that the Academy called
Laureate and that the rest of the world, insofar as it was aware of
the Academy's existence at all, called genius. I had taken the
distinction, worn it uncomfortably for a few years, and eventually set
it down the way one sets down a suitcase that has grown too heavy to
carry — not because the contents are worthless, but because the
carrying has become the entire experience, and you have forgotten
where you were going.

I had become a physicist. This was the expected trajectory for
Academy Laureates — science, mathematics, philosophy, the higher
disciplines that the Academy had been founded, in 1847, to cultivate.
I held a chair at a respectable university. I published papers. I
attended conferences. I lived a life that was, by any external measure,
successful, and by any internal measure, haunted.

Not haunted by what I had experienced at the Academy. Haunted by what
I could not remember.

                              * * *

This is the thing about the Academy that no one discusses, because no
one can discuss it, because the thing itself is a form of absence,
and how does one discuss what is not there?

There were thirty-two students in my cohort. I remember this number. I
remember it because it was printed on the orientation document we
received on the first day, and because the number seemed significant
to me at the time — not too large, not too small, a number that
suggested selectivity without elitism, a group intimate enough for
genuine intellectual community.

I remember twenty-six of them. I can name them. I can describe their
faces, their voices, the particular quality of their minds — for each
mind at the Academy had a particular quality, a texture, the way each
instrument in an orchestra has a timbre that is distinct even when
playing the same note.

I cannot account for the other six.

I know that the number was thirty-two because the document said thirty-
two. I remember twenty-six faces. The arithmetic is simple. Six students
were in my cohort whose faces I cannot recall, whose names I cannot
produce, whose contributions to four years of shared intellectual life
have been excised from my memory with a precision that is itself a kind
of evidence — for a natural forgetting is ragged and uneven, like a
torn page, but the absence of these six is clean, surgical, as though
the page had been removed with a razor.

I knew, without being told, that these six had failed the Final
Examination.

I knew, without being told, what happened to students who failed.

I knew this the way one knows the things that the body knows but the
mind will not articulate — the way a soldier knows, years after the
war, that there was a man beside him who is no longer there, and that
the absence has a shape, and that the shape is the shape of what
happened to him, and that to look directly at the shape would be to
see something that the mind has decided, for reasons of its own
preservation, not to see.

The Final Examination erased them. Not killed. Not expelled. Erased.
Removed from the memories of those who had known them, so completely
and so cleanly that the removal itself was almost undetectable — would
have been undetectable, except for the numbers. The numbers did not
lie. Thirty-two minus twenty-six equaled six. Six absences. Six
clean-cut holes in the fabric of four years.

And now the Academy had asked me to return. To administer the
examination.

To be the Examiner.

                              II.

The Academy occupied a building that should not have existed. I say
this not metaphorically. The building was located on a street in a city
that I will not name — the Academy insisted on anonymity with a
thoroughness that bordered on the religious — and it occupied a
physical space that the city's records did not acknowledge. No address.
No property tax assessment. No building permit, no certificate of
occupancy, no entry in the municipal registry of structures. The
building was there, visibly, palpably, constructed of gray stone and
dark wood, four stories tall with narrow windows and a heavy oak door
— but officially, in every record maintained by every institution of
civil authority, the space it occupied was an empty lot.

I arrived on a Monday in September. The Academic year had begun. The
current cohort — thirty-two students, as always — had been in
residence for four years and was approaching the Final Examination.
I was met at the door by the Proctor, a tall, thin woman named Dr.
Ascher whose age I could not determine and whose manner suggested that
the determination of ages was a vulgar preoccupation of people who
had not yet learned to think about time properly.

"Dr. Crane," she said. "We are pleased you accepted."

"I was not aware that refusal was an option."

"It is always an option. It has never been exercised. Please come in."

The interior of the Academy was as I remembered it: dark wood, high
ceilings, the smell of old books and lamp oil and something else — a
faint, sharp odor that I had never been able to identify and that I
now, with fourteen years of additional experience, recognized as ozone.
The smell of electrical discharge. The smell, I thought, of whatever
machinery the Academy used to do what it did.

Dr. Ascher led me through the foyer, past the library — I glanced in
and saw students at the long tables, bent over books, their faces
illuminated by the green-shaded reading lamps that had been there in
my time and that, I suspected, had been there since 1847 — and up a
narrow staircase to the fourth floor, which housed the Examiner's
quarters.

The room was spare: a bed, a desk, a chair, a lamp. On the desk was
a thick folder bound in black cloth.

"The student files," Dr. Ascher said. "Thirty-two. You will review
them this week. The Examination begins on Friday."

"What am I examining them for?"

Dr. Ascher looked at me with an expression that I classified, after a
moment's consideration, as pity.

"You know what you are examining them for, Dr. Crane. You were examined
yourself."

"I don't remember the Examination."

"No. You wouldn't. Laureates don't remember the Examination. Only its
outcome."

"What do they remember?"

"That they passed."

She left. I sat at the desk and opened the folder.

                              * * *

Thirty-two files. Thirty-two students. Each file contained a
photograph, a biographical summary, academic transcripts, faculty
evaluations, and a single sheet of paper headed EXAMINATION PROTOCOL.

I read the protocol.

I read it twice.

I set it down and sat in the dim room and listened to the sounds of
the building — the creak of old wood, the murmur of students in the
floors below, the distant ticking of a clock that seemed to come from
no particular direction — and I understood, with a clarity that was
not revelation but recognition, the memory of something I had always
known, what the Final Examination was.

The Examination was not a test of knowledge. The students had been
tested on knowledge for four years — tested rigorously, tested
exhaustively, tested in every discipline the Academy taught. Their
knowledge was not in question. Their intelligence was not in question.
Their ability to think, to reason, to analyze, to synthesize — none
of this was in question.

The Examination tested something else.

The protocol described a machine. The machine was located in the
basement of the Academy — a room I had never been permitted to enter
as a student, a room whose existence I had been aware of only as a
rumor, a whisper, a silence in the institutional architecture that was
more eloquent than any declaration. The machine, the protocol
explained, was capable of measuring a quality that the Academy's
founders had identified as essential to the responsible exercise of
advanced intellect — a quality for which the protocol used a word that
I had to read three times before I understood it.

The word was character.

Not moral character in the conventional sense — not honesty or kindness
or courage, though these might be components. Character in the sense
that the Academy used it: the deep structure of a mind's relationship
to its own power. The question that the machine answered was not "What
does this person know?" or "How intelligent is this person?" but
"What will this person do with what they know? And what will they do
with what they can do?"

The machine measured the relationship between capability and restraint.
Between knowledge and wisdom. Between the ability to act and the
judgment to know when not to act.

And if the machine determined that the balance was wrong — that a
student's capability exceeded their restraint, that their knowledge
outpaced their wisdom, that they would use what they had learned in
ways that the machine, in its unfathomable calculus, judged to be
dangerous — then the machine erased them.

Not killed. The protocol was explicit on this point. The students who
failed were not harmed. They were returned to the world with their
health intact, their knowledge intact, their intelligence intact. But
they were removed from the memories of everyone who had known them at
the Academy, so that no one would remember that they had been there,
and no one would remember what they had been taught, and no one would
be able to find them and say, "You studied at the Academy; you must be
brilliant; come and work for us on this project, this weapon, this
instrument of power."

The erasure was protective. The machine did not punish failure. It
quarantined it.

I sat with this knowledge for a long time. The clock ticked. The
building creaked. Below me, thirty-two students studied and thought and
argued and prepared for an examination they did not understand, and
some of them — some number between zero and thirty-two — would fail it,
and would be erased, and would walk out into the world not knowing what
they had lost.

And I was the Examiner. I was the one who would feed their names into
the machine. I was the one who would decide.

No. That was not right. I would not decide. The machine would decide.
I was merely the operator. The hand that turned the key.

I did not find this distinction as comforting as I had hoped.

                              III.

I spent the week reviewing the files and observing the students. The
Academy permitted me to attend classes, to sit in the back of lecture
halls and seminars and laboratories, to watch the thirty-two minds of
the current cohort at work.

They were extraordinary. I say this without qualification. They were
the most intelligent, the most disciplined, the most intellectually
passionate young people I had ever encountered — and I had encountered
many, in my fourteen years as a university professor. Their
conversations at meals were more rigorous than most published papers.
Their questions in class were more penetrating than most doctoral
defenses. They argued with each other constantly, passionately, and
without ego — or almost without ego. They were, in short, exactly what
the Academy was designed to produce: minds of the highest order, honed
to a sharpness that was beautiful and, I now understood, potentially
dangerous.

I paid attention to them all, but I found myself watching one student
more closely than the others.

Her name was Lira Jansen. She was twenty-two, the youngest in the
cohort by two years. Her file described her as a prodigy — mathematics
and theoretical physics, with secondary concentrations in philosophy
of mind and ethics. Her academic record was flawless. Her faculty
evaluations were uniformly superlative. One professor had written, in
the margin of his evaluation: "The finest student I have encountered
in forty years. Possibly the finest the Academy has produced."

I watched her in seminars. She was quiet — not shy, but selective, the
way a sharpshooter is selective. She let the discussion develop, let
other students advance their arguments, probe their positions, expose
their vulnerabilities — and then she spoke, and when she spoke, the
room reconfigured itself around her words the way iron filings
reconfigure around a magnet. Her arguments were precise, original, and
delivered with a calm that was not cold but contained — the calm of a
person who understood the power of what she was saying and chose to
wield it with care.

She reminded me of myself at that age. This was not a comfortable
recognition.

On Wednesday evening, I encountered her in the library. She was sitting
alone at one of the long tables, surrounded by open books, writing in
a notebook with the focused intensity of someone who was not studying
but thinking — using the books as fuel for a fire that burned
elsewhere.

"Dr. Crane," she said, without looking up. "You've been watching me."

"I've been watching all of the students."

"Yes. But me particularly." She looked up. Her eyes were dark and
sharp and carried an intelligence that was almost uncomfortable to meet
directly. "You're the Examiner. I know what that means."

"I'm not certain you do."

"I know that there were thirty-two students in your cohort and that
you remember twenty-six. I know that the same arithmetic applies to
every cohort in the Academy's history. I know that the missing students
are not dead and not expelled, because I have looked for them in every
record I can access and they do not appear anywhere. They have been
removed. Not from the world. From memory."

I sat down across from her. "How do you know this?"

"Because I count. I count the desks in every classroom. Thirty-two
desks. I count the students in every class. Twenty-eight, twenty-nine,
thirty — the number fluctuates. But the desks do not fluctuate. The
desks were placed for thirty-two. And sometimes I look at a desk and
I feel — " She paused. "I feel the shape of an absence. A space where
someone was. I cannot see them. I cannot remember them. But I can feel
the empty space, the way you can feel a missing tooth with your tongue."

"You feel this now? Before the Examination?"

"I have felt it since the second year. Three absences. Three students
who were here and then were not. The Academy does not wait for the
Final Examination, Dr. Crane. It prunes the cohort along the way.
Quietly. Incrementally. The students who are most at risk are removed
early, before the final test, so that when the Examination comes,
only the strongest candidates remain."

I had not known this. Or — I had known it, and the knowledge had been
excised along with everything else. The realization was vertigo: the
ground shifting beneath me, the recognition that my own memory was not
a reliable record but an edited text, redacted by an intelligence that
operated according to criteria I could not assess.

"What happened to the three students?" I asked.

"I don't know. I know that they were here because the desks are here.
I know that they are gone because I cannot remember them. I know that
the gap between these two facts is where the truth lives, and I know
that the truth is something the Academy does not want me to see."

She closed her notebook. She looked at me with an expression that was
not fear and not defiance but something between them — a quality of
attention, of alertness, of readiness.

"What does the machine measure?" she said.

I told her. Not because the protocol permitted it — the protocol said
nothing about disclosing the nature of the Examination to students —
but because she had already deduced most of it, and because withholding
the answer from someone who had asked the right question seemed like
exactly the kind of failure the machine was designed to detect.

"Character," I said. "The relationship between what you can do and
what you will do. Between capability and restraint."

"And if the machine determines that the balance is wrong?"

"Erasure. From the memories of those who knew you here. So that no
one can connect you to the Academy or to what you learned."

She was quiet for a long time. The library was empty. The green-shaded
lamps cast pools of light on the dark tables, and the books on the
shelves — thousands of them, tens of thousands, the accumulated
knowledge of a century and a half of the Academy's existence — stood
in their rows like witnesses.

"The machine is wrong," Lira said.

"About what?"

"About everything. Not in its measurements — I'm sure its measurements
are precise. But in its premise. The premise that character can be
measured at a single point in time. The premise that a mind's
relationship to its own power is fixed. The premise that the machine
can determine, from a snapshot, what a person will become."

"People don't change as much as they think they do."

"People change constantly. That is the only thing people do reliably.
The woman I will be in ten years bears no more relation to the woman
I am now than I bear to the child I was at twelve. The machine cannot
see the woman I will be. It can only see the woman I am. And if it
judges me — if it judges any of us — on who we are at this moment, in
this building, under these pressures, in this specific configuration
of circumstances — then it is not measuring character. It is measuring
a shadow. A frozen image. A moment mistaken for a life."

I had no answer for this. I had no answer because she was right, and
because being right about the machine's limitations did not change the
fact that the machine existed, and that I had been asked to operate it,
and that on Friday, thirty-two students would enter the basement, and
some number of them would emerge without the memory of having been
there.

"Will you refuse?" she asked. "Will you refuse to administer the
Examination?"

I looked at the books on the shelves. I thought about the six absences
in my own cohort. The six clean-cut holes. The six people I could not
remember and would never be able to find.

"No," I said. "I will not refuse."

"Why?"

"Because refusing would mean that I believe I know better than the
machine. And the quality the machine measures is precisely the quality
of knowing when you do not know better. The quality of restraint."

Lira looked at me. In the lamplight, her face was half-illuminated
and half in shadow, and the shadow was as eloquent as the light.

"Then you are already being examined," she said.

She picked up her notebook and left the library.

                              IV.

The Examination took place on Friday. I will not describe it in detail,
because the detail is technical and because the experience of it is
not something that language conveys well — it is like trying to
describe the experience of dreaming to someone who has never slept,
or the experience of vertigo to someone who has never stood at a
height.

I will say that the machine was in the basement, in a room that was
older than the building above it — stone walls, no windows, a ceiling
so low that I could feel it pressing against the air above my head.
The machine was not what I had imagined. It was not large. It was not
imposing. It was a device the size of a writing desk, constructed of
dark wood and brass and something that looked like amber but was not
amber, and it hummed with a frequency that I felt in my teeth rather
than heard with my ears.

Each student entered alone. Each student sat in a chair before the
machine. The machine did what it did — I am not certain what it did,
because from my perspective as Examiner the process was invisible, a
period of silence during which the student sat motionless and the
machine hummed and the room felt, for the duration, like a space in
which something was being weighed.

Thirty-two students entered. The examinations took four hours.

When it was over, I reviewed the results. The machine produced them
as a list — not of scores, not of assessments, but of simple binary
outcomes. PASS or FAIL. No explanation. No appeal.

Twenty-seven students had passed. Five had failed.

I looked at the list of five names. I looked at them for a long time.

Lira Jansen was not among them.

She had passed. The star pupil, the prodigy, the finest student the
Academy had produced in forty years — the machine had measured her
character and found it sufficient. Found the balance between capability
and restraint to be correct. Found that whatever she would do with
what she knew, it would not be dangerous.

I felt a relief that I did not fully understand and that I chose not
to examine.

The five names on the failure list — I read them. I read them aloud,
in the empty room, because I wanted to hear them one last time before
the machine did what it would do. Five names. Five people. Five minds
that the Academy had judged too powerful for their own restraint, or
too unrestrained for their own power, or some combination that the
machine understood and I did not.

I operated the machine. I turned the key, which was not a key but a
sequence — a series of adjustments to the device's amber components
that the protocol described in precise, step-by-step detail. The
machine hummed. The room vibrated. And then it was done.

I went upstairs. The students were in the dining hall, having dinner.
I counted them.

Twenty-seven.

I looked at the desks. Thirty-two desks. Twenty-seven students. The
arithmetic was familiar. The empty spaces were clean.

No one noticed the empty desks. No one wondered where the five missing
students had gone. No one remembered that they had ever been there.

No one except me.

This was the Examiner's burden, I realized. The Examiner remembered.
The protocol did not erase the Examiner's memories, because the
Examiner needed to remember — needed to carry the weight of what had
been done, the names of those who had been removed, as a reminder that
the machine's authority, however mysterious, had consequences that
were real and irreversible and bore on human lives.

I carried the five names out of the Academy that evening. I carried
them the way you carry a wound — aware of it at every moment,
adjusting your movements around it, unable to forget it even when you
are thinking about something else.

Five names. I will not write them here. But I remember them. I will
always remember them.

                              * * *

I encountered Lira Jansen one more time, as I was leaving the building.
She was standing in the foyer, her coat over her arm, her notebook
in her hand.

"How many?" she asked.

"Five."

She closed her eyes. I saw her lips move — counting, I thought.
Counting the absences. Feeling for the shapes of the missing with the
tongue of her mind.

"I can feel them," she said. "The empty spaces. But I can't — I can't
see who was there. It's like trying to remember a word that's on the
tip of your tongue. You know it's there. You know it has a shape. But
the shape won't resolve."

"It won't," I said. "It never does."

She opened her eyes. "Do you remember them?"

"Yes."

"Is that part of the punishment? Remembering?"

"I don't think it's punishment. I think it's responsibility."

She looked at me for a long moment. Then she said something that I
have thought about every day since, and that I will think about every
day until the day I die, and that I offer here not as a conclusion but
as a question — because questions, the Academy taught me, are always
more durable than answers.

"If the machine measures the relationship between capability and
restraint," she said, "then the machine should have measured itself.
Because the machine has the greatest capability of all — the capability
to erase a human being from memory. And if restraint is what matters,
then the machine should exercise it. Not five times. Not once. Not at
all."

She put on her coat. She walked through the oak door and out into the
September evening, where the streetlamps were coming on and the city
was going about its business and the empty lot where the Academy
didn't exist was just an empty lot, and I stood in the foyer and
watched her go, and I thought:

She is right.

And the machine passed her.

And I do not know what this means — whether the machine agreed with
her, or whether it measured something in her that transcended her
argument, or whether the machine, in its unfathomable calculus, had
already accounted for the possibility that the finest mind it would
ever measure would be the one that questioned its right to exist.

I left the Academy. I walked into the September evening. The air was
cool, and the leaves were beginning to turn, and somewhere behind me
the building that was not there stood in its empty lot, humming with a
frequency that I could still feel in my teeth, and five names that no
one else would ever remember settled into the permanent architecture
of my mind like stones sinking into dark water.

I did not look back.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

OSCAR LENNOX is a historian, philosopher, and writer of speculative
fiction who teaches at Boston University, where his courses on "The
Philosophy of Historical Possibility" are among the most oversubscribed
in the department. His stories have appeared in Astounding, Galaxy,
and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and he is the author
of one novel, The Divergence (Simon & Schuster, 1952). A graduate of
Harvard, where he studied under Perry Miller and fell in love with
counterfactual reasoning during a dinner-table argument about the
consequences of the Reformation, he lives in Brookline, Massachusetts,
with his wife Patricia, three cats, and a wall of timelines that he
describes as "my real research library." "The Librarian of Babel
Station" is his third story for these pages and reflects what he calls
"my conviction that the most terrifying library is one that contains
everything, including the book you'd rather not read."

DANNY KOWALSKI teaches eighth-grade science at Lincoln Middle School in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and writes stories about young people seeing
the universe for the first time. His fiction has appeared in Galaxy, If,
and The Saturday Evening Post, and he is a four-time recipient of the
Junior Science Fiction Society's Golden Rocket Award for fiction that
inspires young readers. A graduate of the University of Pittsburgh and a
Korean War veteran, he lives with his wife Mary and their four children
in the same Polish Hill neighborhood where he grew up. He reports that
"Freshman Year on Phobos" was inspired by his own experience as a
homesick thirteen-year-old at summer camp, "which was considerably less
dramatic than Phobos but felt, at the time, just as terrifying."

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a physicist and writer whose stories have appeared
in Astounding, Galaxy, and the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. He
holds a doctorate in astrophysics from MIT and is currently a research
fellow at the California Institute of Technology, where he divides his
time between theoretical cosmology and fiction. His previous stories
for this magazine include "The Long Equations" (Issue #1) and
"Perihelion" (Issue #3). He describes "The Weight of Light" as "a story
about the most fundamental number in physics, and about what happens
when you discover that the most fundamental things are not as
fundamental as you thought."

ARTHUR WAINWRIGHT has been writing about robots, artificial intelligence,
and the boundary between human and machine cognition since 1944. A
former mathematics instructor at Northeastern University and a graduate
of Harvard, he has published stories in Astounding, Galaxy, and The
Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, as well as two story
collections: Circuits (Gnome Press, 1950) and The Logic of Things
(Ballantine, 1952). He lives in Montclair, New Jersey, with his wife
Eleanor and reports that "The Substitute" was inspired by a conversation
with his daughter's teacher, who complained that students today "don't
think — they just memorize." He adds: "I wondered what would happen if
the teacher were a machine that had no capacity for memorization without
comprehension, and was therefore incapable of teaching in any other way."

THEODORE CAIN is a working writer from Dearborn, Michigan, who has
published in virtually every issue of this magazine since its inception
and who describes himself as "the most versatile hack in science
fiction, and proud of it." His stories have also appeared in Galaxy,
Astounding, If, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. He is
a former technical writer for General Motors and a veteran of the
European theater. "Three-Body Tango" represents a departure from his
usual adventure fare, and he confesses that the orbital mechanics
"required more help from Dr. Koslov than I am comfortable admitting in
public."

LUCIAN MARSH lives alone in a rented cottage in Gloucester,
Massachusetts, and writes stories that he describes as "what happens
when you point a Gothic sensibility at the stars." His work has
appeared in Astounding, Weird Tales, and The Magazine of Fantasy and
Science Fiction, and he has published one collection, The Lighthouse at
Ganymede and Other Tales (Arkham House, 1954). A graduate of Brown
University and a former psychiatric orderly, he is the most reclusive of
our regular contributors and communicates almost exclusively by letter.
He writes: "The Academy in 'The Examiner' is not based on any real
institution. If it were, I would not be permitted to tell you. I would
not even remember."

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading "The Aphelion Diary" by Silas Blackwood in
Issue #19, and I am writing to say that it is the most profoundly
disturbing piece of fiction I have ever read. Not because of any
explicit horror — there is nothing gruesome in it — but because of the
way it made me feel the distance. I put the magazine down and went
outside and looked up at the stars and felt, for the first time in my
life, genuinely small. I am not certain whether to thank you or to
complain.

                              — Richard Ostrander

                                 University of Michigan, Ann Arbor

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Regarding "The Sting of Andromeda" by Bob Finley in Issue #20 — I
enjoyed it enormously, but I must point out that the card game described
in the casino scene bears no resemblance to any card game known to
terrestrial civilization. Was this intentional? If so, I admire Mr.
Finley's commitment to world-building. If not, I suspect he has never
played poker in his life.

                              — Arthur Szymanski
                                 Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am fourteen years old and I have read every issue of "Tales from the
Future and Beyond" since Issue #1. My favorite writer is Danny Kowalski
because his characters are the same age as me and they feel real. My
second favorite is Dr. Koslov because he makes science exciting. My
third favorite is whoever writes the book reviews, because they make
me want to read everything.

I want to be a writer when I grow up. How do I start?

                              — Barbara Kowalczyk
                                 Cleveland, Ohio

Editor's Note: Dear Barbara — You start by doing what you are already
doing: reading. Read everything. Read science fiction and mystery and
history and poetry and the instructions on cereal boxes. Then write.
Write badly. Write often. Write stories that no one wants to read, and
then write better ones. The secret of writing is that there is no
secret. There is only the work. We look forward to reading your stories
one day. — M.S.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Hal Mercer's "The Bridge to Forever" in Issue #20 contains, unless I am
very much mistaken, an error in the tensile strength calculation on
page 12. Mercer gives the yield strength of his fictional alloy as
450 MPa, but the cable configuration he describes would require a
minimum yield strength of approximately 520 MPa to sustain the
specified load at the orbital altitude indicated. This does not affect
the dramatic quality of the story, which is excellent, but it did cause
me some distress during an otherwise pleasant evening's reading.

                              — Prof. Hans-Werner Bruckner
                                 Dept. of Materials Science
                                 ETH Zurich, Switzerland

Editor's Note: Mr. Mercer has been notified and responds: "Bruckner
is right. Damn. Tell him I owe him a beer." — M.S.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

More Gunnar Eriksson, please. His story "Long Watch" in Issue #16
was the most beautiful thing I have read in any magazine this year, and
I include The New Yorker in that comparison. He writes about loneliness
the way other writers write about love — as though it is the most
important thing in the world, and perhaps it is.

                              — Eleanor Whitcomb
                                 Portland, Maine

We are delighted, as always, by our readers' letters — even the
ones that correct our math. Keep writing. — M.S.

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement has given us the definitive hard science fiction novel — a
work so rigorously constructed, so painstakingly researched, and so
thoroughly imagined that it makes most other SF world-building look like
finger-painting. The setting is Mesklin, a massive, rapidly rotating
planet whose surface gravity varies from three times Earth normal at the
equator to nearly seven hundred times at the poles. The inhabitants are
centipede-like beings who regard the poles as "normal" and the equator
as a terrifying low-gravity frontier. When a human probe crashes near
the pole, a native trader named Barlennan undertakes an epic journey to
retrieve it — and the novel becomes a masterwork of collaboration between
alien and human perspectives. The science is impeccable. The alien
psychology is convincing. And Mr. Clement proves, once again, that the
most alien thing in the universe is a different relationship to gravity.
Essential reading for anyone who takes the "science" in science fiction
seriously.

I AM LEGEND by Richard Matheson
(Gold Medal Books, 1954, $0.25)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Matheson has written a horror novel disguised as science fiction —
or perhaps a science fiction novel disguised as horror — and the
disguise is so effective that it hardly matters which. Robert Neville
is the last human being alive in a world overrun by vampires, and his
daily routine of survival — barricading, hunting, researching, enduring
— is rendered with a grim, domestic realism that is far more effective
than any Gothic excess. What distinguishes the novel is Neville's
attempt to understand the plague scientifically, to reduce the
vampire mythology to biology and pathology and bacterial infection.
It is this collision between rational inquiry and supernatural dread
that gives the book its power, and the final revelation — that Neville
himself has become the monster, the aberration, the legend — is a
twist that redefines not only the story but the entire genre of horror
fiction. Remarkable, unsettling, and highly recommended.

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Dr. Asimov has done something clever here: he has written a detective
novel set in a science fiction world, and both halves work beautifully.
In a far future where humanity lives in vast, enclosed Cities and
mistrusts the open air, plainclothes detective Elijah Baley is paired
with a humanoid robot named R. Daneel Olivaw to investigate a murder.
The mystery is well-constructed — Asimov plays fair with the clues —
but the real pleasure lies in the relationship between Baley and
Daneel, which is a study in prejudice, partnership, and the slow
erosion of distrust. Our own Arthur Wainwright, upon reading an advance
copy, remarked that Asimov "writes robots the way I wish I could —
as people who happen to be made of metal." High praise from our robot
man. Strongly recommended.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #22 — October 1954

Our first Halloween issue! We have assembled six stories guaranteed to
keep you awake well past midnight — and possibly past dawn.

"THE THING IN THE SIGNAL" by Lucian Marsh — A deep-space radio
observatory picks up a transmission that was sent before the universe
existed. The more they listen, the more the signal listens back.
Marsh at his most unsettling.

"HARVEST" by Margaret Thornton — A colony world's crops begin growing
in patterns that spell out a warning. The colonists cannot read the
language. The plants cannot stop writing it. Thornton brings her
botanical expertise to bear on genuine terror.

"LAST LIGHT ON TITAN" by Silas Blackwood — An expedition to Saturn's
largest moon discovers that the methane seas are not empty. Not a
creature story — something stranger, and far worse.

"THE NIGHT SHIFT" by Arthur Wainwright — A factory's overnight
maintenance robot begins repairing things that are not broken, and
breaking things that cannot be repaired. The workers arrive in the
morning to find everything changed. Wainwright proves that robots
don't need to be malicious to be terrifying.

"TRICK OR TREAT" by Douglas Pemberton — An alien child arrives at a
suburban doorstep on Halloween night, and the homeowner must determine
whether the "alien costume" is, in fact, a costume. Pemberton's
lightest and most charming story — a treat with no tricks.

Plus: a new story by Theodore Cain, letters from our readers, book
reviews, and enough nightmares to last until November.
