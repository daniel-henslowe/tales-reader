TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

I owe you an apology and a warning.

The apology is this: what follows may cost you sleep. I assembled this
issue over the course of three weeks in August, and by the time the final
manuscript was typeset, I had not slept properly in seven days. Not
because of the work — though the work was considerable — but because of
the stories themselves. They followed me to bed. They stood in the
corners of my room when I turned out the light. They waited.

The warning: they will do the same to you.

October has become our annual tradition of darkness, and I am proud to
say that this, our fourth Halloween issue, is the blackest yet. We begin
with Harrison Blackwood's "Cathedral of Fear," a story I purchased
knowing it would disturb me and discovering, upon reading the final
draft, that "disturb" was an inadequate word. Blackwood has given us a
structure — an alien architecture designed for the sole purpose of
generating terror — and in describing it, he has produced something that
functions, on the page, precisely as the cathedral functions in the
story. You have been warned.

Lucian Marsh follows with "Replacement," a slow-burn horror of identity
that begins with a man coming home to his family and ends — but I will
not tell you where it ends. I will say only that the basement scene kept
me staring at my ceiling until three in the morning. Phyllis Crenshaw,
our reigning queen of temporal logic, brings us "Witch of Waystation
Nine," a ghost story wrapped in a time-travel puzzle wrapped in the
loneliest outpost tale I have ever read. Theodore Cain delivers "Tooth
and Claw," a colony story that begins as a charming Halloween tale and
becomes something else entirely. Agnes Whitfield's "The Passenger"
is, I believe, her finest and most unsettling work — a quiet horror
that creeps in like cold air under a door.

Robert Finley gives us "Dead Satellites Spelling," proof that even our
most action-minded contributor can chill the blood when he sets his mind
to it. And Oscar Lennox closes the issue with "Masque of the Red Shift,"
a story of such cosmic scope and such intimate dread that I found myself,
upon finishing it, unwilling to look at the night sky. That is a
remarkable thing for a science fiction editor to confess, and I confess
it freely.

Seven stories. Seven nightmares. This is the issue that kept me awake
for a week, and I offer it to you with the same mixture of pride and
unease with which one offers a guest a glass of wine that might be
poisoned.

Happy Halloween.

Sleep well.

Yours in the dark,

                         CATHEDRAL OF FEAR

                       by Harrison Blackwood

                               I.

The structure was visible from orbit as a wrongness in the terrain.

Dr. Maren Soloway saw it first on the mapping screens of the survey
vessel Laertes, during the third pass over the northern continent of
Kepler-442b — a world the crew had been calling Acheron, because someone
had read their Virgil and because the planet, with its basalt plains
and sulfur-tinged atmosphere, seemed to deserve a name associated with
the underworld. The continent below was a plateau of dark volcanic rock,
scored by ancient rivers that had dried to pale scars, and the structure
rose from the center of this desolation like a growth — like something
that had erupted from the planet's crust rather than been placed upon it.

"There," Soloway said, pointing. "Grid reference seven-seven by
fourteen-three. Do you see it?"

Cho, the ship's geologist, leaned over her shoulder and looked at the
screen. The topographic overlay showed the structure as an anomaly in
the elevation data — a vertical irregularity approximately four hundred
meters tall, with a footprint that covered nearly a square kilometer.
Its geometry was immediately, viscerally wrong. Not irregular, in the
way that natural formations are irregular. Wrong. The angles did not
correspond to any known geological process. The surfaces, even at this
resolution, appeared to have been shaped with deliberate, inhuman
precision.

"That's not natural," Cho said.

"No."

"How old?"

Soloway ran the spectrographic analysis. The mineral composition of the
structure's surface matched the surrounding basalt in its radioactive
decay profile, which placed it within the same geological epoch as the
plateau itself. "Preliminary estimate: six to eight hundred million
years."

Cho was quiet for a moment. Six hundred million years. Before complex
life had emerged on Earth. Before the Cambrian explosion, before
trilobites, before anything that could be called an eye had opened to
see anything that could be called a world. Something had built this
structure when the most advanced organisms on Earth were mats of
bacteria on a lifeless shore.

"We're going down," Soloway said.

"Obviously," Cho replied.

                               * * *

The landing party consisted of four people: Soloway, Cho, a structural
engineer named Brennan, and the ship's physician, Dr. Ayotunde Osei,
who had insisted on accompanying them with the quietly immovable
authority of a man who had been keeping people alive in deep space for
twenty years and was not about to let them walk into an alien structure
without medical supervision.

They set down on the basalt plain three kilometers from the structure
and approached on foot. The sky above Acheron was a deep amber, tinged
at the horizon with a chemical green where the sulfur compounds in the
upper atmosphere refracted the light of the system's K-type star. The
air was breathable — barely — through their supplemental filters, and
it tasted of metal and ozone, like the air before a thunderstorm that
never arrives.

The structure grew as they walked toward it.

This was, of course, a matter of perspective. They were approaching a
large object across a flat plain, and large objects appear to grow as
one approaches them. Soloway knew this. She had spent twenty-two years
as a xenoarchaeologist, eleven of them in the field, surveying the ruins
of dead civilizations on nine worlds. She had approached alien
structures before. She understood the geometry of approach.

But this was different.

The structure did not merely grow larger. It grew in complexity. At two
kilometers' distance, it appeared to be a single monolithic form — a
spire, perhaps, or a tower, dark against the amber sky. At one
kilometer, she could see that it was not a single form but an
aggregation of forms, interlocking and overlapping, each one distinct
but none of them separable from the whole. At five hundred meters, the
individual forms resolved into surfaces, and the surfaces resolved into
textures, and the textures resolved into patterns, and the patterns —

Soloway stopped walking.

"What is it?" Cho asked.

She did not answer immediately. She was looking at the structure — really
looking at it, for the first time, without the mediation of a screen or
a spectrographic overlay — and what she saw made something clench in
the deepest part of her chest, below the ribs, in the place where fear
lives before it reaches the conscious mind.

The patterns on the surface of the structure were not decorative. They
were not symbolic. They were not the abstract geometries that
civilizations typically used to mark their buildings, their monuments,
their sacred places. They were something else. Something that Soloway's
eyes could see but her mind could not classify, because the patterns
existed in a space between the recognizable and the incomprehensible —
a space that the human visual cortex was not designed to process, and
whose existence, therefore, registered not as perception but as alarm.

"It's wrong," she said, softly.

"What is?"

"The patterns. The angles. All of it. Look at the — the way the surfaces
meet. Look at the proportions. Every ratio is — " She stopped. She did
not have the words. The vocabulary of architecture, of geometry, of
aesthetics, was insufficient. The structure was not ugly. It was not
chaotic. It was, in some terrible way that she could not articulate,
beautiful. But its beauty was the beauty of a thing that should not
exist, and the recognition of that beauty produced, in the human nervous
system, a response that was indistinguishable from dread.

"I see it," Brennan said, quietly. The engineer had stopped beside her,
and his face, behind his filter mask, was pale. "The proportions are
designed. Deliberately. Every visible ratio is — off. Not random. Not
arbitrary. Precisely off. Like someone studied the golden ratio and then
inverted it. Like someone mapped every proportion the human eye finds
harmonious and then calculated its opposite."

"We're not human," Osei said. He had stopped too, and his voice carried
the careful steadiness of a man who is controlling something. "I mean —
whatever built this was not human. These proportions weren't designed
for us."

"No," Soloway said. "But they work on us anyway."

She looked at the structure, rising four hundred meters above the basalt
plain, its surfaces crawling with patterns that her eyes refused to
resolve into meaning, its angles meeting at junctions that made her
visual cortex flinch, its proportions producing in her body a sustained,
low-grade terror that had no object and no name. Six hundred million
years old. Built by something that no longer existed, on a world that
had never known life more complex than the microbial mats they had found
in the dry riverbeds. Built, and left, and waiting.

"We're still going in," she said.

No one argued. But no one moved, either, for a long moment.

                               II.

The entrance was not a door.

It was an absence — a place where the structure's surface folded inward
upon itself, creating a passage that was simultaneously an opening and a
deepening, as though the geometry of the exterior simply continued
inward, carrying the eye and the body with it the way a current carries
a swimmer into depths they had not intended to reach. There was no
threshold. No frame. No demarcation between outside and inside. The
structure simply became interior, and the moment at which this
transition occurred was impossible to identify, which meant that by the
time Soloway realized she was inside, she had been inside for some
time, and could not say precisely when she had crossed over.

This was, she understood later, the first effect.

The interior was vast. The ceiling — if it was a ceiling; the geometry
made it difficult to assign conventional architectural terms — rose to
a height that the floodlights could not reach. The walls were not walls
in any meaningful sense but surfaces that curved and interlocked in ways
that created the impression of enclosure without providing it. There
were spaces within spaces, chambers that opened into other chambers
through apertures that were not quite doorways, corridors that
branched and reconverged according to a logic that was not illogical
but which obeyed rules that the human spatial sense could not decode.

And every surface was covered with the patterns.

Soloway played her floodlight across the nearest wall. The patterns
were carved — or grown, or extruded; the manufacturing process was not
evident — into the dark stone to a depth of perhaps two centimeters.
They were intricate, fractal, recursive: each pattern contained smaller
versions of itself, which contained smaller versions still, down to the
limits of visual resolution and presumably beyond. The effect, viewed up
close, was hypnotic. The eye wanted to follow the pattern inward,
wanted to trace its self-similar involutions deeper and deeper, wanted
to reach the center where the recursion terminated and some final form
would be revealed.

But the recursion did not terminate. The pattern went down and down and
down, and the deeper the eye followed it, the more the surrounding
environment receded from awareness, until there was nothing but the
pattern and the eye and the growing, nauseating sensation that the
pattern was not a design on a surface but a hole — that the fractal
recursions were not carved into the stone but carved through it, and
what lay on the other side of the stone was something that the pattern
was specifically designed to reveal, layer by layer, level by level,
in a controlled and deliberate unveiling that would culminate in —

Soloway tore her eyes away. Her heart was hammering. Her palms were
wet inside her gloves. She had been staring at the wall for — she
checked her chronometer — eleven minutes. Eleven minutes, motionless,
lost in a pattern on a wall, while her heart rate climbed and her
cortisol levels spiked and her hindbrain screamed warnings that her
conscious mind could not interpret.

"Don't look at the walls too long," she said, over the comm.

"Already figured that out," Brennan replied. His voice was tight. "I
was tracking one of the patterns and I — I couldn't stop. It was like
falling. Like the pattern was pulling me in."

"Same," Cho said. "I had to physically turn away."

Osei was checking his medical scanner. "All four of us show elevated
cortisol, elevated heart rate, pupil dilation. Consistent with a
sustained fear response. But there's nothing here to be afraid of. The
air is clean. There's no biological activity. No radiation anomalies.
No movement, no sound. Nothing."

"The structure is the thing to be afraid of," Soloway said. "That's
what it's for."

They looked at her.

"I think," she said, carefully, "that this building was designed to
generate fear."

                               * * *

They moved deeper into the structure, and the fear intensified.

It was not a linear intensification. It came in waves, in surges, in
sudden spikes that made Soloway's breath catch and her muscles lock,
followed by troughs of relative calm that were worse, somehow, than the
spikes, because in the troughs she could think clearly enough to
understand what was happening to her and to anticipate the next surge,
and the anticipation was itself a form of terror.

The architecture controlled it. She became certain of this as they
progressed. The corridors widened and narrowed according to a rhythm
that corresponded to the intensification of the fear response. The
ceiling height varied — sometimes soaring out of sight, producing a
vertiginous agoraphobia; sometimes pressing down until they had to
duck, producing a suffocating claustrophobia. The patterns on the walls
changed character as they moved deeper: the outermost patterns had been
hypnotic, seductive, drawing the eye inward; the deeper patterns were
more aggressive, more dissonant, producing not fascination but
revulsion, a visceral desire to look away that warred with an equally
visceral inability to do so.

And the proportions of the spaces themselves — the ratios of height to
width, of corridor length to chamber diameter, of aperture size to wall
area — were all wrong, in ways that Brennan, who had studied
architecture for fifteen years, described with increasing agitation as
they advanced.

"It's not just inverted aesthetics," he said. They were standing in a
chamber that was roughly oval, its ceiling lost in darkness, its walls
covered in patterns that seemed to shift and writhe at the edge of
peripheral vision. "It's more sophisticated than that. Every proportion
in this room is calibrated to produce a specific neurological response.
The height-to-width ratio triggers the agoraphobic response. The wall
curvature interferes with spatial orientation — you can't tell how far
away the walls are, which triggers a threat-assessment loop in the
amygdala. The patterns are designed to capture and hold visual
attention, which prevents the prefrontal cortex from overriding the
fear response with rational assessment. It's — " He paused. "It's a
machine. The whole building is a machine. A fear-generating machine."

"Built by whom?" Osei asked. He was monitoring their biosigns with an
expression of professional concern that did not quite mask his own fear.
"And for what purpose?"

"I don't know," Soloway said. "But I know it works."

It worked. On all of them. Despite their training, despite their
rationality, despite the knowledge that they were in an empty building
on a dead world and that nothing in the building could harm them, the
fear was real and it was escalating. Cho, the steadiest of them, had
developed a tremor in his hands. Brennan's voice had taken on a high,
tight quality. Osei was sweating through his suit. And Soloway herself
felt, beneath the professional detachment she was fighting to maintain,
a growing conviction — irrational, sourceless, absolute — that they
were being watched. That something in the structure was aware of them.
That the empty chambers were not empty but occupied by a presence so
vast and so patient that their four small human bodies, creeping through
its corridors with their pathetic floodlights, were beneath its notice
— and that the moment it chose to notice them, something irreversible
would happen.

She knew this was not true. She knew the building was empty. Her
instruments confirmed it. There was nothing here but stone and geometry
and the ancient, terrible artistry of a civilization that had understood
fear — that had understood it so thoroughly and so intimately that they
could encode it in architecture, could make the walls themselves a
delivery system for dread.

But knowing it was not true did not make it go away.

                               III.

They found the central chamber after four hours.

Four hours of corridors and chambers, each one more disturbing than the
last, each one more precisely calibrated to dismantle the defenses of
the rational mind. Soloway catalogued them as they went, her voice
recorder running continuously, her words coming in the clipped,
professional cadence that she used when she was frightened and did not
want anyone to know.

There was the chamber of vertigo, where the floor was a transparent
material — not glass; something harder, colder — beneath which the
structure dropped away into a shaft of unknowable depth, and the
patterns on the transparent floor created the illusion that the surface
was tilting, slowly, inexorably, threatening to spill them into the
abyss. They crossed it on hands and knees, and Cho vomited twice.

There was the corridor of sounds, where the geometry of the walls
created resonances from nothing — from the movement of air, from their
own footsteps, from the vibrations of their own bodies — and these
resonances combined into a sound that was not a sound but a frequency,
a vibration that bypassed the ears entirely and acted directly on the
structures of the inner ear, producing a dizziness and a disorientation
that was accompanied, inexplicably, by grief. They moved through this
corridor as quickly as they could, and all four of them were weeping
when they emerged, and none of them could say why.

There was the chamber of the mirror, where the walls were surfaced with
a material of such perfect reflectivity that it created an infinite
regression of reflections — reflections of reflections of reflections,
receding in every direction to infinity — and the patterns inscribed on
this surface created distortions in the reflections that were subtle,
almost imperceptible, so that each reflected self was not quite right:
the proportions slightly off, the posture slightly wrong, the face
bearing an expression that the original face was not wearing. Soloway
looked at her reflection and saw herself looking back with an expression
of terror that she was not — she was certain she was not — actually
displaying. And then she realized that she was.

"I want to turn back," Cho said, in the corridor beyond the mirror
chamber. His voice was flat. "I am registering this formally. I want
to turn back."

"Noted," Soloway said. "We're close to the center. I can see the
geometry converging. One more chamber."

"You don't know that."

"I do. Every corridor we've taken has been spiraling inward. The
acoustic properties of the walls are changing — the resonances are
getting more complex, which means the wall thickness is increasing,
which means we're approaching the structural core. One more chamber."

"And if the one more chamber is worse than what we've been through?"

Soloway looked at him. His face was gray, his eyes red-rimmed, his
hands clenched at his sides. She suspected she looked no better.

"It will be," she said. "But we came here to see what's at the center,
and I'm going to see it."

Cho stared at her. Then he nodded, once, sharply.

They went on.

                               * * *

The central chamber was the size of a cathedral.

Soloway's first thought, stepping through the final aperture, was that
the word was inadequate. Her second thought was that it was not. The
space was precisely the size and shape of a cathedral — not any specific
cathedral, not Notre-Dame or Chartres or Cologne, but the Platonic ideal
of a cathedral, the fundamental spatial archetype from which all human
cathedrals were derived. A vast nave, soaring upward into darkness. A
sense of enclosure that was simultaneously protective and threatening.
An axis of symmetry that drew the eye forward, toward a focal point
that the architecture insisted was the most important place in the
building, the place where the purpose of the structure would be
revealed.

Except that this cathedral had not been built by human beings, and its
proportions were not human proportions, and the focal point toward
which the geometry converged was not an altar or a pulpit or a window
but something else — something that Soloway's eyes could see but her
mind could not process, because it occupied a place in her perceptual
field that was reserved for things that should not be there.

She walked forward. Her boots echoed on the dark stone floor, and the
echoes propagated upward into the invisible ceiling and returned
transformed — not diminished, not diffused, but changed in timbre and
pitch, so that her footsteps came back to her as something that was
almost, but not quite, a voice.

"Maren," Osei said, behind her. "Your heart rate is one hundred and
forty-two. Your cortisol is three times baseline. Your amygdala
activity — "

"I know."

"You need to stop."

"I need to see what's at the center."

She walked forward, along the nave of the cathedral of fear, toward the
focal point that the architecture demanded she approach. The walls rose
on either side of her, covered in patterns that were denser and more
intricate than anything they had seen, patterns that seemed to move in
her peripheral vision — not the illusion of movement produced by
complex static patterns, but actual movement, a slow, deliberate
shifting of the carved lines, as though the patterns were alive, were
breathing, were adjusting themselves in response to her presence.

She told herself this was impossible. The building was six hundred
million years old. The patterns were carved in stone. Stone does not
move.

But her peripheral vision was insistent, and her peripheral vision was
the oldest and most reliable part of her visual system, the part that
had evolved to detect predators in the tall grass, and it was telling
her, with a certainty that no rational argument could override, that
the walls were moving.

She reached the focal point.

It was a space. An absence. A place where the floor dropped away into
a circular opening, perhaps ten meters in diameter, and the opening was
deep — the floodlight could not find the bottom — and the walls of the
opening were smooth and featureless, utterly unlike the pattern-covered
surfaces of the rest of the structure. They were simply dark. Simply
stone. Simply a hole in the floor of the cathedral, going down.

Soloway stood at the edge and looked down. Her floodlight penetrated
perhaps thirty meters before the darkness consumed it. There was nothing
to see. No markings. No artifacts. No evidence of purpose. Just a shaft,
perfectly circular, perfectly smooth, perfectly empty, descending into
the body of the planet.

And from the shaft, rising like heat from a vent, came fear.

Not the fear she had been experiencing — not the calibrated, controlled,
architecturally generated fear that the building's surfaces and
proportions and patterns had been producing. This was something else.
This was raw. This was the substrate. This was the fear that the
building was designed to refine, to amplify, to focus — the way a
telescope focuses light, the way a radio antenna focuses signal, the
way a church focuses faith. The building was a mechanism for collecting
and concentrating fear, and this shaft was where the fear was gathered,
and it rose from the darkness below in a continuous, silent, invisible
column that struck Soloway in the center of her chest and filled her
body with a terror so pure and so absolute that she could not move.

She understood.

Standing at the edge of the shaft, paralyzed, her mind dissolving
under the pressure of a fear that had been engineered by a civilization
dead for six hundred million years, Soloway understood what the
cathedral was. Not a weapon. Not a prison. Not a laboratory. A place
of worship.

The civilization that had built this structure had worshipped fear.

Not the things that caused fear — not predators, not death, not darkness,
not the void. Fear itself. The emotion in its purest form, stripped of
object and context and cause, reduced to its neurological essence: the
activation of the amygdala, the flood of cortisol, the paralysis of
the higher functions, the total, annihilating awareness that something
is wrong and that the wrongness cannot be escaped. They had worshipped
this. They had built a cathedral to it. They had designed every angle,
every surface, every proportion to generate it with increasing
intensity, leading the worshipper inward, chamber by chamber, through
escalating gradations of terror, toward this central point where the
fear became absolute — where the worshipper stood at the edge of the
shaft and felt the raw, unmediated presence of the thing they adored.

And the beauty of the building — because it was beautiful; even
paralyzed with terror, even as her consciousness fragmented under the
pressure, Soloway could see that it was beautiful — the beauty was
inseparable from its function. The fear was the beauty. The beauty was
the fear. The civilization that had built this place had not distinguished
between the two, because for them, the two were the same: the sublime,
the transcendent, the experience that lifted the worshipper out of the
mundane and into the presence of something vast and incomprehensible
and sacred.

They had found, in terror, their god.

And they had built this place to be in its presence.

                               IV.

Osei pulled her back.

She did not remember him approaching. She did not remember his hands on
her shoulders, or the moment when the paralysis broke, or the stumbling
retreat from the shaft's edge. She remembered only the transition —
the sudden, vertiginous shift from the shaft's field of influence to
the merely terrible background fear of the cathedral nave — and the
sensation, grotesque and disorienting, of relief. As though the ambient
terror of the building, which had been unbearable an hour ago, was now
a comfort. A baseline. A normal.

"You were at the edge for seven minutes," Osei said. His voice was
professionally calm, but his hands, holding her shoulders, were shaking.
"Your heart rate reached one-eighty. Your cortisol is off the scale.
You were not responding to voice or touch. I had to physically drag
you."

"I saw — " She stopped. She had not seen anything. The shaft was empty.
There was nothing to see. What she had experienced was not vision but
comprehension — a sudden, devastating understanding of purpose that had
arrived not through her eyes but through her fear, as though the fear
itself were a medium of communication, a language that the builders had
spoken and that Soloway's body, despite being separated from them by
six hundred million years and a gulf of biological evolution, could
still partially understand.

"I know what this place is," she said.

"So do I," Osei replied. "It's a building designed to drive people
insane, and we need to leave it."

"It's not designed to drive people insane. It's designed to — " She
groped for the word. "Elevate them."

"Maren."

"It's a church, Ayotunde. It's a church."

Osei looked at her with an expression that combined professional concern
with something deeper — something personal, something frightened. "A
church to what?"

"To fear. To the experience of fear. They didn't worship a god or a
force or an idea. They worshipped the feeling itself. The pure
neurological event. The way we — some of us — worship beauty, or truth,
or love. They worshipped terror. And this building is their cathedral."

Cho and Brennan had retreated to the entrance of the central chamber.
Brennan was sitting against the wall with his head between his knees.
Cho was standing with his arms wrapped around himself, his eyes fixed on
the floor. Neither of them looked up.

"We need to leave," Osei said again.

"Yes," Soloway agreed. "But I need to record everything first. The
proportions, the patterns, the acoustic properties, the spatial
relationships. All of it. This is the most important xenoarchaeological
find in human history, and I need to document it."

"It will still be here tomorrow."

"Will we still be willing to come back tomorrow?"

Osei did not answer this question, because they both knew the answer.

                               * * *

Soloway documented the central chamber for two hours while the others
waited at the entrance, as far from the shaft as the geometry permitted.
She worked with methodical precision, recording measurements, taking
samples, photographing every surface from multiple angles. She dictated
observations in a voice that was steady and clinical and belonged, she
felt, to someone else — to the professional part of her that could
function in the presence of this building's central mystery the way a
surgeon could function in the presence of blood.

The shaft exerted its pull continuously. She felt it as a physical
force — a gravity of attention, a weight in the center of her chest
that intensified whenever she faced it and diminished, but did not
disappear, when she turned away. It was, she realized, exactly analogous
to the pull that a sacred object exerts in a human church — the altar,
the tabernacle, the niche where the idol sits. The eye is drawn to it.
The body orients toward it. The attention returns to it, again and
again, because the architecture insists.

The builders had understood this. They had understood it across a gulf
of biology so vast that the commonality should have been impossible.
Human and alien, separated by six hundred million years and by every
conceivable difference of form and chemistry and neural architecture,
nevertheless shared this one thing: the capacity for fear. The capacity
for the amygdala — or whatever analogous structure the aliens had
possessed — to override the higher functions, to flood the body with
chemicals that screamed danger, to reduce the complex edifice of
consciousness to a single, annihilating imperative: be afraid.

And the builders had found, in this capacity, something sacred.

Soloway stood at the edge of the shaft again — not too close; she kept
a three-meter margin that she did not cross — and looked down into the
darkness. The fear rose, steady and absolute, like a column of cold air
from an underground river. She let herself feel it. She did not fight
it, did not rationalize it, did not engage the professional detachment
that had sustained her through the rest of the structure. She simply
stood there and felt afraid.

And in the fear, she found something she had not expected.

Reverence.

Not her own — she was not reverent; she was a scientist standing in an
alien building, scared out of her mind and documenting it for posterity.
But the building's. The building was reverent. Every surface, every
angle, every proportion, every pattern was an expression of reverence —
of the most profound and total reverence she had ever encountered, more
profound than the Gothic cathedrals of medieval Europe, more total than
the temple complexes of ancient Egypt, more absolute than any human
sacred space she had ever entered. The builders had not merely
constructed a church. They had constructed an act of worship so vast
and so permanent that it had outlasted their civilization, their species,
their biological kingdom, their geological era. Six hundred million
years, and the worship continued. Six hundred million years, and the
cathedral still functioned. Six hundred million years, and the fear
still rose from the shaft, and the patterns still crawled on the walls,
and the proportions still made the body tremble, and the act of
reverence that the builders had encoded in stone and geometry and the
fundamental architecture of perception was still, after all this
incomprehensible time, doing exactly what it had been designed to do.

Generating fear.

Generating worship.

Generating the experience that the builders had found, in the depths of
their alien consciousness, to be the most profound and the most
sacred and the most beautiful thing in the universe.

Soloway recorded this insight in her voice log. She described it in
clinical terms — neurological activation patterns, architectural
proportions, the correspondence between spatial geometry and fear
response. She did not mention the tears on her face, or the way her
voice broke on the word "beautiful," or the fact that she stood at the
edge of the shaft for another six minutes after the recording stopped,
feeling the fear, and, despite everything, despite the paralysis and
the cortisol and the hammering of her heart, understanding it.

                               V.

They left the cathedral at dusk.

The amber sky had deepened to a color that had no terrestrial name — a
color between rust and blood, shot through with veins of sulfurous
green where the upper atmosphere caught the last light of the setting
star. The basalt plain stretched away in every direction, flat and
featureless and dead, and the cathedral rose behind them, its silhouette
black against the darkening sky, its surfaces already invisible in the
failing light so that it appeared as a void, a place where the sky was
not — a structure defined not by its presence but by the absence it
created in the visual field.

They walked back to the shuttle in silence. No one spoke. There was
nothing to say that the building had not already said, in the only
language it knew.

In the shuttle, with the hatches sealed and the air recycling and the
structure receding in the rear cameras as they lifted off, Brennan
broke the silence.

"I've been thinking about the proportions," he said. His voice was
hoarse. He had not spoken in three hours. "The fear response we
experienced — it shouldn't have worked on us. The builders couldn't
have known human neurology. They couldn't have designed for human
perceptual responses. We're separated by six hundred million years and
an entirely different evolutionary lineage. There's no way they could
have predicted what proportions would trigger fear in a human brain."

"Unless they didn't design it for humans specifically," Soloway said.

"That's what I'm thinking. I think they designed it for — everyone.
For any nervous system complex enough to experience fear. I think they
found the universal proportions. The ratios that trigger the fear
response in any brain, regardless of species, regardless of
evolutionary origin. The — the Platonic proportions of terror."

"Is that possible?" Osei asked. "Can there be universal geometric
triggers for a specific emotion?"

"There shouldn't be," Brennan said. "But the evidence suggests there
are. The building works. It works on human neurology that the builders
never encountered and could not have anticipated. Which means either
they got extraordinarily lucky, or they understood something about the
relationship between geometry and consciousness that we don't."

"They understood fear," Soloway said. "They understood it the way we
understand mathematics. As a universal truth. A property of the
universe itself. Something that any sufficiently complex nervous system
will discover, the way any sufficiently advanced civilization will
discover prime numbers or the speed of light."

The shuttle climbed through the amber atmosphere. Below, the cathedral
was a dark point on the dark plain, diminishing, but not — Soloway
felt — receding. It did not recede. It remained present in the way
that a religious experience remains present, not as a memory but as a
mark, a permanent alteration in the structure of the self.

"They're gone," Cho said, quietly. "The builders. Six hundred million
years gone. Whatever they were, they're extinct."

"Yes."

"And the cathedral is all that's left."

"Yes."

"The only trace. The only evidence that they existed at all. And what
they chose to leave behind — the thing they built to outlast everything
else, the thing they poured their deepest understanding into — was a
building designed to make anyone who enters it afraid." He paused. "What
does that tell us about them?"

Soloway thought about this for a long time. The shuttle broke through
the upper atmosphere and the sky darkened from amber to black, and the
stars appeared — sharp and cold and uncountably many, spread across
the void in patterns that the human eye strained to organize and
could not.

"It tells us," she said, "that they found something sacred in the most
fundamental experience of consciousness. Not joy. Not love. Not
wonder. Fear. The oldest emotion. The one that every nervous system
shares. The one that says: you are small, and the universe is vast,
and you do not understand, and you cannot control what is coming. They
found that sacred. They built a cathedral to it. And the cathedral
works — it works on us, six hundred million years later, across a gulf
of biology that should make commonality impossible — because they were
right. Fear is universal. It is the one experience that connects every
conscious being that has ever existed or will ever exist. And they
worshipped that connection."

"That's terrifying," Osei said.

"Yes," Soloway said. "That's the point."

                               VI.

Back on the Laertes, Soloway filed her preliminary report. It was
forty-seven pages long, meticulously detailed, scientifically rigorous,
and entirely inadequate. She knew it was inadequate because no report,
however detailed, could convey what it felt like to stand in the
central chamber of the cathedral and feel the fear rising from the shaft
— the ancient, engineered, sacramental fear that a dead civilization
had refined to its purest form and enshrined in stone for the
edification of anyone, of any species, who might one day stand where
they had stood and feel what they had felt.

She lay in her bunk that night and did not sleep. The fear was still in
her — not the acute terror of the cathedral, but a residual awareness
of it, a tremor in the foundations of her consciousness, like the
aftershock of an earthquake that has rearranged the landscape of the
self. She thought about the shaft. She thought about the patterns on
the walls. She thought about the sound of her own footsteps returning
to her as something that was almost a voice.

She thought about going back.

Not tomorrow. Not on any scheduled survey mission. She thought about
going back alone, without instruments, without a team, without the
professional framework that had allowed her to experience the cathedral
as a xenoarchaeological site rather than as what it was. She thought
about walking into the cathedral as a worshipper. About following the
corridors inward, chamber by chamber, through the escalating gradations
of terror, to the central nave and the shaft and the pure, absolute,
sacred fear that rose from the darkness below.

She wanted to. The wanting was physical, visceral, located in the same
place in her chest where the fear had lodged. It was, she realized, the
same wanting that draws a person back to a church — the desire to be
in the presence of the thing that transcends, the thing that lifts the
self out of the ordinary and into contact with something vast and
incomprehensible and holy. The cathedral had done this to her. It had
worked. Six hundred million years old, designed for alien neurology,
operating through the crude and universal machinery of the fear
response, it had produced in her the experience that its builders had
intended.

It had made her feel the sacred.

And the sacred, she understood now, was not comfort. Was not peace. Was
not the warm reassurance that the universe was ordered and benevolent and
that her place in it was secure. The sacred was the opposite. The sacred
was the annihilation of security. The dissolution of the self in the
face of the incomprehensible. The terror of confronting something so
vast that the mind could not contain it and so real that it could not
be denied. This was what the builders had understood. This was their
theology. Fear was not the enemy of the sacred. Fear was the sacred.
The two were identical, and the cathedral was the proof.

Soloway lay in her bunk and felt the residual fear vibrating in her body
like a struck bell, and she understood the builders, and she was afraid
of them, and she was in awe of them, and she knew — with a certainty
that she could not justify and could not escape — that these two
responses were the same response, and that the builders, dead for six
hundred million years, would have approved.

She did not sleep. But in the dark of her bunk, staring at the metal
ceiling of the ship, she felt something that she could not name and
that no language she possessed could capture — something vast and
terrible and beautiful, something that the cathedral had placed inside
her and that would remain inside her for the rest of her life, a seed
of sacred terror that would never stop growing.

Outside the ship, the stars burned in the void. On the planet below,
the cathedral stood in the darkness of the basalt plain, empty and
ancient and patient, its patterns crawling on its walls, its shaft
open to the sky, its fear rising like incense into the indifferent
night.

It had waited six hundred million years.

It could wait longer.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                           REPLACEMENT

                          by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                               I.

I came home on a Tuesday, in the rain.

The shuttle from Port Avalon set down at the colony's eastern landing
field at half past four in the afternoon, and I walked the two
kilometers to our house on Settler's Row carrying my duffel over one
shoulder and feeling, as I always felt upon returning from the southern
survey stations, that peculiar displacement of the traveler — that
sense that the familiar has become, in one's absence, subtly foreign.
The houses looked the same. The prefabricated walls, the corrugated
roofing, the small gardens that the colonists tended with a devotion
that bordered on the religious — all of it was exactly as I had left
it six months ago. And yet it was not the same, because I was not the
same, because six months in the southern stations changes a man in ways
that are difficult to articulate and impossible to undo.

The rain was warm. Kepler's rain is always warm — blood-warm, with a
faint alkaline taste that you learn to ignore after the first year.
It fell from a sky the color of bruised copper, and it made the ground
soft, and my boots sank into the mud of Settler's Row as I approached
the house, and the sound of my approach was swallowed by the rain, and
no one came to the door.

I stood on the porch for a moment, looking at the door. Our door. The
door I had helped install three years ago, when we first arrived on
Kepler-186f with the Second Wave colonists and drew this lot on
Settler's Row and built this house with our own hands, Emily and I,
while the children played in the red mud and the alien rain fell warm
around us. The door was slightly warped — the local wood swelled in the
wet season, which was most seasons — and there was a scratch near the
handle where Tommy had tried to carve his name with a kitchen knife.

I opened the door and went in.

Emily was in the kitchen. She looked up from the counter where she was
chopping something — a local vegetable, one of the tuberous things that
grew in the alkaline soil and tasted like a potato's apology for
existing — and she smiled.

"You're back," she said. "Dinner's in an hour."

She said it the way she might say it if I had been gone for an
afternoon. The way she might say it if I had walked to the trading post
and returned. Not the way she would say it if her husband had been gone
for six months at a survey station three thousand kilometers to the
south, mapping terrain in the constant rain, sleeping in a prefab
shelter with four other surveyors and a radio that worked when it felt
like it.

"I'm back," I said.

"Wash up. The children are in the yard."

I set my duffel down in the hallway and went to the window. The yard
was a small rectangle of mud and alien grass — a hardy, blue-green
ground cover that the colony's botanists had encouraged as a soil
stabilizer. Sara and Tommy were there, playing some game that involved
sticks and a ball made of compressed fiber. They were bigger than I
remembered. Sara was ten now — no, eleven. She had grown three inches
in my absence. Tommy was seven, still small, still fierce, still
swinging the stick with the reckless abandon of a boy who has not yet
learned that the world can swing back.

They did not look up. They did not see me at the window. I watched
them for a moment, feeling the displacement deepen — the sense that I
was looking at my life from outside it, through a pane of glass that
was transparent but impermeable, and that the people on the other side
of the glass were my people, my family, my blood, but that they existed
in a space that I had not yet reentered.

"How was the south?" Emily asked, from the kitchen.

"Wet," I said. "Always wet."

"Find anything?"

"Some mineral deposits. A river system that wasn't on the maps. The
usual."

"Hmm."

She went back to chopping. The sound of the knife on the cutting board
was steady and rhythmic and domestic, and it should have been
comforting, and it was not.

I went to wash up.

                               II.

Dinner was ordinary.

This is important. I want to be precise about this, because precision
is the only tool I have left, and because the ordinary quality of that
dinner was the first sign that something was wrong, though I did not
recognize it as a sign at the time.

We ate in the kitchen, the four of us, at the table I had built from
local lumber during our first year. Sara talked about school — the
colony school, where forty-seven children of varying ages were educated
by three overworked teachers in a converted storage building. Tommy ate
with his fingers until Emily told him to use his fork. Emily talked
about the community garden, the problems with the irrigation system,
a neighbor whose greenhouse had collapsed in the last windstorm.

No one asked about the south. No one asked what I had seen, what I had
mapped, what I had experienced during six months of solitary survey work
on an alien continent. No one asked if I was all right. No one asked
if I had missed them.

No one said welcome home.

I told myself that this was normal. That colonists, living on the edge
of a hostile world, did not have the emotional bandwidth for dramatic
reunions. That six months was a standard rotation, and the surveyors
came and went, and the families adapted, and life continued, and the
colony survived because people did not dwell on absences but carried
on with the work. I told myself this, and I believed it, mostly, and
the part of me that did not believe it — the part that had been looking
forward to this moment for six months, that had imagined Emily's arms
around me and the children's shouts and the warm, enveloping relief of
being home — that part I pushed down, into the place where
uncomfortable truths are stored until they can be dealt with.

After dinner, I put the children to bed. Sara submitted to the ritual
with the weary tolerance of an eleven-year-old who considers herself
too old for tuck-ins but permits them out of charity. Tommy fell asleep
before I finished the story — one of the old Earth fairy tales that we
had brought with us on the colony ship's data files, stories about
wolves and witches and children lost in forests, stories that meant
something different on a world where the forests were real and alien
and the things that lived in them had no names.

I went back to the kitchen. Emily was washing dishes.

"They seem good," I said.

"They are good."

"Sara's gotten tall."

"She eats like a horse. I can't keep enough food in the house."

I leaned against the counter and watched her wash the dishes. Her
movements were efficient and familiar — the way she held the plate
under the water, the way she scrubbed in small circles, the way she
set each clean dish on the rack with a small, precise motion. I knew
these movements. I had watched them a thousand times. They were my
wife's movements, and they were exactly right, and I could not shake
the feeling that something was wrong.

"Emily," I said.

"Hmm?"

"Are you — is everything all right?"

She looked at me. Her expression was open, pleasant, neutral. "Of
course. Why?"

"I don't know. I just — it feels strange. Being back."

"It always feels strange. You said so last time."

"Did I?"

"After the second rotation. You said coming home felt like putting on a
shirt that doesn't quite fit anymore."

I did not remember saying this. It sounded like something I would say.
But I did not remember it.

"Right," I said. "It'll pass."

"It always does." She dried her hands and kissed me on the cheek — a
quick, efficient kiss, the kind you give someone you have been married
to for fourteen years, the kind that is less an expression of affection
than a punctuation mark, a period at the end of a sentence that says:
this conversation is over, it is late, come to bed.

I came to bed. I lay beside my wife in the dark and listened to the
rain on the corrugated roof and felt the displacement pressing against
my chest like a weight, and I did not sleep.

                               III.

In the morning, Emily mentioned the other one.

She mentioned it casually, the way one mentions a household
arrangement that is too familiar to require explanation. We were eating
breakfast — the grain porridge that was the colony's staple, flavored
with a local sweetener that tasted like honey filtered through copper
wire — and she said, between bites, not looking up from her bowl:

"You should check on the other one when you get a chance. He's been
quiet lately."

I set my spoon down.

"The other one," I said.

"In the basement. He hasn't been eating much. I've been leaving trays
at the top of the stairs, but half the time they come back untouched."

She said this in the same tone she used to discuss the irrigation
system, or Sara's schoolwork, or the neighbor's collapsed greenhouse.
Matter-of-fact. Unremarkable. As though "the other one in the basement"
were a category of household concern equivalent to a dripping faucet or
a sticky door.

"Emily," I said. "What are you talking about?"

She looked up. Her expression was patient, slightly puzzled — the
expression of someone who has been asked to explain something obvious.
"The other one. The other you. He's been down there since — oh, three
months? Four? He came back from the south early. Something happened,
I think. He doesn't talk about it. But he's been down there, and he's
yours to deal with, really. I've been managing, but now that you're
back — "

"Emily. Stop."

She stopped. She looked at me with that patient, puzzled expression, and
I looked at her, and the displacement that I had been feeling since I
walked through the door — that sense of looking at my life through
glass — cracked, and through the crack poured something cold.

"There is a man in our basement," I said. "A man who looks like me."

"He is you," Emily said. "The other you. The one who came back early."

"And you — you've been living here. With the children. With a man in
the basement who — "

"He stays in the basement. He doesn't bother anyone. The children know
not to go down there. It's fine, Martin. It's been fine."

I stood up. The chair scraped against the floor. The sound was loud in
the kitchen, louder than it should have been, and Sara looked up from
her porridge with the alert, watchful expression of a child who has
learned to read the emotional weather of a household.

"Dad?" she said.

"It's fine, sweetheart. Eat your breakfast."

I went to the basement door.

                               * * *

The basement was not a basement in any proper sense. It was a cellar —
a space dug into the alien soil beneath the house, shored up with local
timber, used for storage. Root vegetables. Preserved foods. Tools. The
things that a colony family accumulates in the early years of settlement,
when everything is precious and nothing is discarded.

The door was at the end of the hallway, past the children's rooms. It
was a simple door — plank construction, a latch, no lock. I stood in
front of it and listened. The house was quiet behind me. Breakfast
sounds: Sara's spoon against her bowl, Tommy humming tunelessly, Emily
moving in the kitchen. Normal sounds. Domestic sounds. The sounds of
a family that has absorbed an impossibility into its routine and
continued functioning, the way a body absorbs a splinter and grows
skin over it.

I opened the door.

The stairs were steep — six steps down to the cellar floor. The light
from the hallway reached the bottom of the stairs and stopped, as though
reluctant to go further. Beyond the light, the cellar was dark, and in
the dark, something moved.

Not a large movement. A shifting. A rearrangement. The sound of a body
adjusting its position on a surface that was not comfortable. A breath,
drawn in and released. Human sounds. My sounds.

I went down the stairs.

He was sitting against the far wall, on a pallet made of blankets and
an old mattress pad. He was wearing clothes that I recognized — a
flannel shirt that I had brought from Earth, work trousers, no shoes.
His knees were drawn up to his chest, and his arms were wrapped around
his knees, and his face —

His face was my face.

Not approximately. Not similar. My face, exactly, down to the scar on
the left cheekbone where I had fallen against a rock during the second
year of the colony, down to the way the stubble grew in a patch on the
right side of the jaw, down to the small mole above the left eyebrow
that Emily had once said looked like a period at the end of a sentence.

My face, but wrong. Thinner. Paler. The eyes deeper in their sockets,
ringed with dark circles that spoke of weeks without proper sleep. The
hair longer, unwashed, pushed back from the forehead in a gesture I
recognized as my own — the habitual raking back of the hair that Emily
had been asking me to stop doing for fourteen years.

He looked at me. I looked at him. We looked at each other across the
cellar, across the impossible fact of each other's existence, and
neither of us spoke, and the silence was the loudest thing I had ever
heard.

"Hello," I said, finally.

He did not respond. He looked at me with an expression that I could not
read, because it was my expression and I had never seen my own
expressions from the outside, and I did not know what this one meant.

"Emily says you've been here for three months," I said.

He nodded. A small movement. Economical. The way I nod.

"She says you came back from the south early."

Another nod.

"She says you're me."

He looked at me for a long moment. Then he spoke, and his voice was my
voice — my voice roughened by disuse, stripped to its essential timbre,
recognizable the way a melody is recognizable even when played on a
different instrument.

"I am you," he said. "Or I was. I'm not sure anymore."

                               IV.

I sat on the bottom step of the stairs and talked to myself.

He told me — the other me, the one in the basement, the one who had
been living under my family for three months while my family went about
its business above him as though he were a piece of stored furniture —
he told me what had happened.

He had been surveying the southern continent, as I had. The same mission,
the same route, the same stations. He had been mapping the river system
in the eastern quadrant — the same river system I had mapped — when
something happened. He was not clear on what. A storm, he thought. A
disorientation. He had been walking along the riverbank in the rain, and
the rain was warm and alkaline, and the ground was soft, and then —

"I was somewhere else," he said. His voice was flat, uninfected, the
voice of a man describing a dream that has become more real than waking
life. "Not the river. Not the station. Somewhere — underground. Dark.
Warm. Wet. I could hear — " He stopped. His hands tightened on his
knees. "I could hear something breathing. Not me. Something else.
Something large. I couldn't see it. I couldn't move. I was — held.
Not physically. I wasn't restrained. I just couldn't move. As if the
air itself had thickened around me and was pressing me in place."

"How long?"

"I don't know. Hours. Days. I lost time. When I could move again, I
was back at the riverbank. In the rain. As if nothing had happened.
But I knew — I knew something had happened. I could feel it. Here."
He pressed his fist against his sternum. "A weight. A presence. As if
something had been put inside me, or something had been taken out. I
wasn't sure which."

He had returned to the station. He had reported a disorientation event
— not uncommon on Kepler, where the electromagnetic fluctuations in
the upper atmosphere could produce neurological effects in unshielded
humans. The station medic had run the standard tests and found nothing
abnormal. He had continued the survey. But the feeling had persisted —
the weight, the presence, the sense of something wrong — and after two
more weeks, he had requested an early return.

He had come home.

"And?" I said.

He looked at me with those deep, hollow eyes — my eyes, but emptied
of something, drained of something that I could not identify.

"And nothing," he said. "I came home. I walked in the door. Emily
was in the kitchen. She looked at me and she said — " He paused. The
pause was long, and heavy, and in it I could hear the rain on the roof
above us, steady and warm and alien. "She said, 'You're back early.
Dinner's in an hour.' And I said, 'Emily, something happened to me
in the south.' And she looked at me, and she — she didn't hear me.
She heard the words, but she didn't hear them. She went back to
chopping, and she said, 'Wash up. The children are in the yard.' And
I — "

He stopped again. His jaw worked. I watched myself struggle with
something that was too large for language, and I felt, in my own chest,
a sympathetic pressure, as though the weight he carried had a twin
inside me.

"I tried," he said. "For weeks. I tried to tell her. I tried to tell
the children. I tried to tell anyone. And no one — " His voice cracked.
"No one heard me. They looked at me. They responded to me. They fed
me and spoke to me and slept beside me. But they didn't hear me. I was
there, in the house, in my own house, with my own family, and I was —
invisible. Not physically. They could see me. But the part of me that
was me — the part that was screaming — they couldn't see that. They
couldn't hear it. It was as if — "

"As if what?"

"As if I wasn't the real one."

The rain fell. The house creaked above us. Somewhere, Tommy laughed —
a bright, uncomplicated sound that belonged to a world where fathers
did not sit in basements talking to copies of themselves.

"And then you arrived," he said. "The other me. The one from the
south. The real rotation. The one who was supposed to come home. And
Emily — she opened the door for you, and she smiled, and she said
dinner's in an hour, and she meant it. She heard you. The children
heard you. You walked in and the house — recognized you. And I — "

He fell silent. He pulled the blanket tighter around his shoulders and
pressed his face against his knees and was quiet, and the quiet was
worse than anything he had said.

"When did you come down here?" I asked, softly.

"After you arrived. I came downstairs. Nobody stopped me. Nobody asked
where I was going. I just — came down. And I've been here since."

"Three months."

"Emily leaves trays."

"Yes. She mentioned."

We sat in the silence of the basement, the two of us, the two of me,
and the rain fell warm and alien above, and I thought about what he had
told me, and I thought about the dinner table where no one said welcome
home, and I thought about Emily's patient, puzzled expression when she
mentioned the other one, and I thought about Sara's watchful eyes, and
I thought about the displacement I had felt since I walked through the
door — the glass between me and my life — and I wondered.

I wondered which one of us was the real one.

                               V.

I went upstairs. Emily was cleaning the breakfast dishes. The children
had gone to school. The house was quiet, and the rain had slowed to a
drizzle, and the light through the windows was the sickly copper-green
of a Kepler morning.

"Emily," I said. "We need to talk about the man in the basement."

"What about him?"

"He says he's me."

"He is you."

"He can't be me. I'm me."

She set down the dish she was washing and turned to face me. Her
expression was calm, reasonable, patient — the expression of a woman
explaining something simple to someone who is making it complicated.

"You're both you," she said. "You're the one who came back on schedule.
He's the one who came back early. You're both Martin. It's not that
complicated."

"Emily, it is exactly that complicated. A man who looks exactly like
me is living in our basement. He says something happened to him in the
south. He says he can't communicate with anyone. He says he feels
invisible. This is not — this is not a normal household situation."

She regarded me with that steady, patient gaze. "Martin," she said.
"He's been here for three months. The children know about him. The
neighbors know about him. Everyone is fine. Everyone has adjusted. The
only person who hasn't adjusted is you."

"Because I just got here."

"Yes. And you'll adjust. You always do."

She turned back to the dishes. The sound of the water and the scrubbing
resumed. I stood in the kitchen of my own house and felt the
displacement pressing against my ribs like a hand pushing me backward,
and I thought: this is not right. None of this is right. And the fact
that everyone around me thinks it is right is the most wrong thing
of all.

I went to see Halloran.

                               * * *

Halloran was the colony physician. He was a compact, gray-haired man
who had been practicing medicine for thirty years, the last five on
Kepler, and who had developed the unflappable manner of a doctor who
has seen everything the colony can throw at him — parasites,
radiation burns, equipment accidents, the neurological effects of the
electromagnetic storms — and has decided that nothing will surprise
him ever again.

I sat in his office, which was a corner of the medical building
partitioned off by a curtain, and I told him about the man in my
basement.

Halloran listened. He did not interrupt. When I finished, he leaned
back in his chair and looked at me with an expression that I recognized
as his diagnostic face — the face he wore when he was evaluating
symptoms and forming a differential.

"How are you sleeping?" he asked.

"I'm not. I've been back one night and I didn't sleep."

"Appetite?"

"Fine. Normal."

"Any headaches, dizziness, visual disturbances?"

"No. Halloran, did you hear what I said? There is a copy of me living
in my basement."

"Yes, I heard you." He leaned forward. "Martin, this isn't the first
time we've seen this. The duplications — they've been happening for
about a year now. People come back from the field and find that a
version of themselves arrived first. It's not common, but it's not
unheard of. We've documented eleven cases in the colony."

I stared at him. "Eleven."

"The running theory is that it's related to the electromagnetic
anomalies in the southern continent. Some kind of — replication event.
The physics are beyond me. Okafor in the science division has a
working hypothesis about quantum entanglement effects in the local
geology, but between you and me, he's guessing."

"And the colonists — the families — they just accept this?"

"They adapt. People adapt, Martin. That's what colonists do. Your
wife has been managing your other for three months. The children are
fine. The community has protocols. The others — we call them the
earlies — they tend to withdraw over time. They move to the lower
levels, the basements, the storage areas. They eat less. They
communicate less. Eventually — " He paused.

"Eventually what?"

"Eventually they stop."

"Stop what?"

"Everything."

The word hung in the air between us. I thought of the man in my
basement — of myself, thin and hollow-eyed, pressed against the wall
in the dark, growing quieter, eating less, retreating into a silence
that would eventually become absolute.

"How long?" I asked.

"Six months. Maybe eight. They fade."

"They die."

"They stop. I don't know if it's the same thing."

I left Halloran's office and walked through the colony in the warm
rain, and every house I passed — every quiet, ordinary house on
Settler's Row — I imagined what was in its basement, and I felt the
cold thing inside me grow larger, and the displacement pressed against
my chest, and I thought: which one of me is going to stop?

                               VI.

I went back down to the basement that night.

He was in the same position — against the wall, knees drawn up, blanket
around his shoulders. The tray Emily had left at the top of the stairs
was untouched. I brought it down and set it on the floor between us.

"You should eat," I said.

He looked at the tray. He did not reach for it.

"It's happening to you too," he said. "I can see it. The displacement.
The feeling that the glass is between you and everything. It was the
same for me."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

"Yes, you do." He looked at me, and his eyes — my eyes — were steady
and calm and full of a knowledge that I did not want to share. "You
walked in the door and nobody said welcome home. You sat at the dinner
table and nobody asked about the south. You lay in bed next to Emily
and she was asleep in five minutes, and you lay there in the dark and
wondered if she knew you were there. If she could feel you. If you
were real to her, or if you were just — another body in the bed."

I did not answer, because he was right, and the fact that he was right
meant that he knew what I was experiencing, which meant that he was
me, which meant that the question of which one of us was real was not
a question that could be answered by examining him. It could only be
answered by examining her. By examining them. By understanding what
it was that the family responded to — what signal, what frequency,
what quality of presence — that made one version of Martin Kessler
the real father, the real husband, the real inhabitant of this house,
and the other version a thing to be fed and stored and waited out.

"They can't tell us apart," I said.

"No."

"But they chose you to be the other one."

"They didn't choose. It just — happened. I came back and I was real
for a while, and then you came back and I wasn't. As if — " He
searched for words. "As if there's only room for one. As if the house,
the family, the — the space that a person occupies in a life — can
only hold one version. And when the second version arrives, the first
one gets — displaced. Pushed out. Not violently. Not deliberately. Just
— gently, inexorably, the way water displaces air. One fills the
space and the other is pushed into the margins. Into the basement."

"But you were here first."

"That doesn't matter. It's not about who arrives first. It's about — "
He stopped. He looked at the ceiling, which was the floor of the house,
the floor of the kitchen where Emily was washing dishes, the floor of
the life that one of us was living and the other was fading out of.
"It's about something I can't name. A quality. A — frequency. The
right one of us resonates with the life, and the wrong one doesn't.
And I'm the wrong one."

"How do you know?"

"Because I'm in the basement."

The logic was circular, and it was airtight, and it was the most
terrifying thing I had ever heard.

"What if it happens to me?" I said. "What if the displacement keeps
growing? What if I — "

"Then you'll come down here. And Emily will leave trays for both of
us. And eventually a third one will come back from the south, and
he'll walk through the door, and they'll say dinner's in an hour, and
you and I will sit down here in the dark and listen to the sounds of
our life going on above us without us."

The rain fell on the roof. The house settled. Somewhere above, a door
closed — Tommy's door, the one with the squeaky hinge that I had been
meaning to oil for a year.

"I won't let that happen," I said.

He looked at me with an expression that I finally recognized, because
it was the expression I saw in the mirror every morning: a man trying
to believe something he knows is not true.

"That's what I said," he replied.

                               VII.

Over the following days, the displacement grew.

I fought it. I woke early and made breakfast. I walked the children to
school. I kissed Emily and asked about her day and listened to her
answers and responded and engaged and was present, fiercely present,
with every ounce of will I possessed. I was the real Martin Kessler.
I was the one who belonged here. I was the husband and the father and
the colonist, and I would not be pushed into the margins, not by
whatever had happened in the south, not by the thing in the basement
that wore my face, not by the slow, gentle, inexorable process that
Halloran had described as stopping.

But the glass was thickening.

I could feel it. Each day, the barrier between me and my life grew
slightly more substantial. Emily's smiles grew slightly less focused.
The children's eyes slid slightly more easily past me. Conversations
shortened. Physical contact decreased. Not dramatically — not in any
way that I could point to and say, there, that is the evidence. But
incrementally, steadily, the way a tide comes in: so slowly that you
cannot see the water moving, but when you look up, the beach you were
standing on is gone.

On the fourth day, Sara called me by name instead of calling me Dad.
She said, "Martin, can you pass the salt?" and then looked confused, as
though she had misspoken, and corrected herself: "Dad. Sorry. Dad."

On the sixth day, Tommy asked Emily where Daddy was, and I was sitting
at the table.

On the eighth day, Emily set the table for three.

I pointed it out. "There are four of us, Emily." She looked at the
table, counted the places, and added a fourth plate with a small laugh
and an apology. "I'm losing my mind," she said. But her hands, setting
the fourth plate, moved with a hesitation that I recognized: the
hesitation of someone performing a task they know is correct but which
feels, inexplicably, superfluous.

I went to the basement that night. He was thinner. He had eaten half
of one tray in three days. He looked at me and said nothing, and his
silence was the silence of a man who has been proven right about
something he desperately wanted to be wrong about.

"It's happening," I said.

"Yes."

"How do I stop it?"

"You don't."

"There has to be a way."

He shook his head. Slowly. The way I shake my head. "There isn't. I
tried everything. I tried being louder, being more present, being more
— more. It doesn't work. The harder you push, the faster it happens.
It's as if the effort itself accelerates the displacement. As if the
life can feel you trying to hold on, and it recoils."

"Then what? I just let it happen? I let myself disappear?"

"You don't let it. It happens regardless. The only choice you have is
whether you go down fighting or go down quietly."

"And which did you choose?"

He looked at me. "I chose fighting. And here I am. In the basement.
In the dark. Listening to my wife wash dishes above my head. So I can
tell you from experience: fighting doesn't work."

I sat on the bottom step and put my face in my hands, and I breathed,
and the air in the basement was cool and damp and smelled of turned
earth and stored vegetables and the slow, organic process of a body
fading.

"There's a third option," he said.

I looked up.

"Leave," he said. "Go back to the south. Go back to the survey
stations. Go somewhere where you're the only version of yourself, where
there's no life to be displaced from, where you can be real because
there's no one around to make you not real."

"And abandon them."

"You've already lost them. You just haven't admitted it yet."

The rain fell. The house breathed. And I sat in the basement with the
version of myself who had gotten there first, and I knew he was right,
and I hated him for it, and the hatred was strange and intimate and
painful, because hating him was hating myself, and hating myself was
the most real thing I had felt since I came home.

                               VIII.

On the tenth night, I lay in bed beside Emily and she was asleep, and
I was not, and I looked at her face in the dim light of the Kepler moon
that filtered through the curtains — her face, familiar, loved, the
face I had carried in my mind through six months in the south, the face
that had been my compass and my anchor and my reason for returning —
and I realized that I could not tell whether she knew I was there.

She breathed. She slept. Her body was warm beside mine, her shoulder
touching my arm, her hair spread across the pillow. But the warmth was
the warmth of proximity, not of connection. The touch was incidental,
not intentional. She was not sleeping beside me. She was sleeping, and
I happened to be there, and my presence or absence would not alter the
quality of her sleep by a single degree.

I got out of bed. She did not stir.

I went to the children's rooms. Sara was asleep with a book open on
her chest — a habit of mine, one she had inherited, or absorbed, or
learned by watching. I stood in her doorway and looked at her, my
daughter, and I whispered her name, and she did not stir. Tommy was
curled in a ball in the center of his bed, his blankets kicked off, as
always. I pulled the blankets up and tucked them around him, and he
murmured something in his sleep and rolled over, and the murmur was
not a word, was not "Dad," was not a recognition, was just the sound
of a sleeping child adjusting to a stimulus that his dreaming mind
registered as impersonal.

I went downstairs. I opened the basement door. The darkness below was
absolute — he had stopped using the light weeks ago. I stood at the
top of the stairs and spoke into the dark.

"Are you awake?"

A long silence. Then: "Always."

"Can I come down?"

"It's your basement."

I went down. I sat on the bottom step. I could not see him, but I
could hear him breathing — my breathing, slow and shallow, the
breathing of a man who is conserving energy because energy is all he
has left.

"I'm joining you," I said.

"I know."

"Not because I've given up. Because — " I stopped. I did not know how
to finish the sentence. Because what? Because the glass had become a
wall? Because my family had become an audience watching a play in which
I no longer had a part? Because the displacement had progressed to the
point where my presence in my own life was a grammatical error — a
word that the sentence of the Kessler family did not require and could
not parse?

"Because there's no room up there for you," he said.

"Yes."

"I know. I said the same thing."

We sat in the dark, the two of us, the two of me, and the house above
us went on being a house, and the family above us went on being a
family, and the rain fell warm and alien on the roof, and in the
morning Emily would come to the top of the stairs and leave two trays,
and neither of us would eat, and the trays would come back untouched,
and she would set them on the counter and sigh and go about her day,
and the children would go to school and come home and play in the yard,
and the life of the Kessler family would continue, complete and
ordinary and whole, and in the basement, two versions of Martin
Kessler would sit in the dark and listen to the sounds of a life that
had closed over their absence the way water closes over a dropped
stone — smoothly, silently, without a ripple.

"How long?" I asked.

"Until we stop," he said.

And the rain fell, and the house breathed, and in the dark of the
basement I reached out and found his hand — my hand, thin and cold —
and held it, and we sat together, the two of me, waiting.

I do not know how long we waited. I do not know if we are waiting still.
I know only that the rain never stopped, and the trays came and went,
and the sounds of the house above grew fainter, and the dark grew
thicker, and the displacement that had started as a crack in the glass
between me and my life became, at last, complete.

And somewhere above, a door opened. And footsteps crossed the hall.
And a voice — Emily's voice, warm and practical and real — said:
"You're back. Dinner's in an hour."

And the man who had come home — the third one, the newest one, the
one who was, for now, real — set his duffel down in the hallway and
went to the window and watched his children playing in the yard, and
he felt, in his chest, the first faint pressure of the glass.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                     WITCH OF WAYSTATION NINE

                       by Phyllis Crenshaw

================================================================================

                               I.

The ghost ship came on Halloween, as it always did.

Vera Koss had been expecting it since September, when the station's
lone calendar — a paper relic she had printed from the archive files
and pinned to the wall above her bunk — turned its page and revealed
the month of October, with its thirty-one numbered squares and its
small, smudged illustration of a jack-o'-lantern that some long-dead
graphic designer on Earth had thought appropriate for the season. She
had been on Waystation Nine for four years, and the ghost ship had come
every October thirty-first, and by now the expectation had settled into
her bones with the same dull certainty as the station's other
regularities: the weekly supply drone, the monthly systems check, the
daily sunrise over the methane sea that was visible from the
observation deck as a pale, chemical glow on the horizon.

Waystation Nine was a relay station in the outer navigation network, a
small pressurized cylinder bolted to an asteroid in the trailing
Trojans of Jupiter. Its purpose was to receive, amplify, and retransmit
navigational signals for the freighter traffic that moved between the
inner system and the outer colonies. This purpose required one human
operator — a warm body to perform maintenance, clear errors, and make
judgment calls that the automated systems were not trusted to make — and
Vera was that body. She had been that body for four years. She would be
that body for two more, unless she requested a transfer, which she
would not, because Vera Koss had come to the trailing Trojans for a
reason, and the reason was solitude, and solitude was what she had.

The station was small enough that she knew every bolt, every weld,
every scratch on every surface. The main cylinder was fifteen meters
long and four meters in diameter, divided into a living space, a
control room, a storage bay, and a cramped airlock. It rotated slowly
to provide a simulacrum of gravity — about a quarter g, enough to keep
her coffee in its cup and her bones from dissolving. The observation
deck was a blister of reinforced glass on the station's dorsal surface,
and from it she could see the stars, and the distant smear of Jupiter,
and the dark bulk of the asteroid to which the station was anchored,
and nothing else. Nothing else in every direction, forever.

She liked it. This was the part that people on the inner stations did
not understand and did not believe. She liked the emptiness. She liked
the silence. She liked the fact that the nearest human being was four
hundred million kilometers away, and that the only voice she heard for
weeks at a time was the station's automated alert system, which spoke
in a flat, genderless monotone and said things like "SIGNAL BUFFER AT
CAPACITY. RETRANSMISSION QUEUE REQUIRES MAINTENANCE." She had named
the voice Harold, and she talked to it sometimes, and Harold never
answered, and that was fine.

The ghost ship, however, was not fine.

It appeared at 23:47 on October 31st, right on schedule.

                               * * *

Vera was on the observation deck, sitting in the single chair she had
bolted to the floor four years ago, drinking coffee and looking at the
stars. She had made a tradition of this — staying up on Halloween night,
watching for the ship, the way a child in an old Earth story might
watch for the arrival of a ghost from a bedroom window. It was not
bravery. It was stubbornness. The ship came whether she watched for it
or not, and Vera had decided, after the first year, that she would
rather see it coming than have it surprise her.

The stars were steady. Jupiter hung in the lower left quadrant of the
viewport, a banded marble the size of her thumbnail. The asteroid's
surface, cratered and dark, filled the bottom of the view. And then,
between one blink and the next, the ship was there.

It appeared without transition. No approach. No deceleration. No
running lights resolving gradually from a point of light to a vessel.
It was simply there, occupying a volume of space that had been empty
a moment before, as though it had always been there and Vera's eyes
had only just consented to see it.

It was a ship — or it had been a ship. The hull was intact but wrong,
in a way that was difficult to articulate. The proportions were
familiar — a standard Consolidated Freight design, a bulk hauler from
the 2040s or 2050s, the kind of ship that moved cargo between the
orbital stations before the newer drives made them obsolete. But the
surfaces were — translucent. Not transparent; she could not see through
them. But they had a quality of thinness, of insufficiency, as though
the ship existed at a lower resolution than the surrounding space, as
though it was a projection rather than an object, a memory of a ship
rather than a ship itself.

It hung in the void, three hundred meters from the station, motionless,
silent, casting no shadow because there was nothing to cast a shadow
on.

"Hello, Harold," Vera said. "Right on schedule."

The station's sensors registered nothing. No mass. No heat signature.
No electromagnetic emission. The ship was visible to Vera's eyes and
invisible to every instrument on the station, which meant either that
her eyes were wrong or the instruments were, and four years of evidence
suggested that her eyes were right.

She watched it. It did not move. It never moved. It simply hung there,
a ghost in the void, for exactly six hours — from 23:47 to 05:47 —
and then it was gone, in the same way it had arrived: without
transition, without explanation, without so much as a displaced
molecule of vacuum to mark its passing.

Vera had documented the first appearance in her station log. She had
filed a report with Navigation Command. The report had been received,
acknowledged, and filed, and nothing had happened, because Navigation
Command had more pressing concerns than a relay operator in the trailing
Trojans who claimed to see a ghost ship on Halloween, and because the
instruments registered nothing, and instruments were trusted more than
eyes.

The second year, she had not filed a report. The third year, she had
not mentioned it to anyone. The fourth year — this year — she simply
sat in her chair on the observation deck and watched, and waited, and
drank her coffee, and prepared herself for the six hours of the ship's
presence with the resignation of a woman who has learned to coexist
with the unexplainable.

But this year was different.

This year, someone was standing on the ship's observation deck,
looking back at her.

                               II.

Vera set her coffee down.

She had binoculars — old-fashioned optical binoculars, one of the
personal items she had brought to the station, because in the void,
where distances were vast and details mattered, there was no substitute
for a good pair of lenses. She raised them to her eyes and focused on
the ghost ship's observation blister, which was a dim, translucent dome
on the vessel's upper hull, identical in design to a hundred other
observation decks on a hundred other ships of this class.

A figure stood inside.

The figure was — she adjusted the focus — the figure was human. Or
human-shaped. The translucency that affected the ship's hull affected
the figure as well: it was present but insufficient, more suggestion
than substance, like a photograph that has been exposed twice on the
same negative. But the shape was unmistakable. A person, standing at
the viewport of the ghost ship, looking across three hundred meters of
vacuum at Vera.

In four years, she had never seen anyone on the ship. The ship had
always been empty — or had appeared empty, which was the same thing
when instruments were useless and eyes were all you had. The hull was
intact, the running lights were dark, and no face had ever appeared at
any viewport. It was a derelict, a dead ship, a ghost. And ghosts did
not have crew.

Except, apparently, this year.

Vera lowered the binoculars. She raised them again. The figure was
still there. It had not moved. It was standing at the viewport with
its hands — she could see hands, or the suggestion of hands — pressed
against the glass, the way someone presses their hands against a
window when they are trying to see through their own reflection.

"All right," Vera said, to no one. To Harold. To the station. To the
four years of solitude that had taught her to narrate her actions aloud
because the sound of her own voice was the only confirmation she had
that she existed. "All right, that's new."

She went to the control room.

The control room was a compact semicircle of consoles and screens,
designed for one operator, which was all the station had ever needed.
Vera ran the sensor sweep again. Nothing. No mass, no heat, no
emissions. The ghost ship was not there, according to every instrument
at her disposal.

She switched to the external camera array and aimed Camera Three at
the ship. The camera saw it. The camera captured the same translucent
hull, the same dead running lights, the same derelict silence. And on
the observation deck — Vera zoomed in, pushed the camera to its
maximum resolution — on the observation deck, the figure.

The camera saw the figure. But the figure, at maximum zoom, was not
just a shape. It was a face. And the face —

Vera's hands went cold on the console.

The face was hers.

Not approximately. Not similar. Her face, exactly, looking back at
her from the observation deck of a ghost ship that did not exist.

But wrong. Older. Thinner. The hair shorter — cropped close, the way
Vera wore it when she had first arrived at the station, before she
stopped caring about maintenance and let it grow. And the eyes — the
eyes, even through the translucent veil of the ship's existence,
were different. Not in color. Not in shape. In depth. They were the
eyes of someone who had seen more than Vera had seen, endured more
than Vera had endured, traveled further than Vera had traveled. They
were her eyes, aged by something worse than time.

And on the face — scars. Thin white lines on the left cheek and jaw,
precise and deliberate, as though someone had drawn on the skin with
a razor. Not random. Patterned. Intentional. Scars that Vera did not
have and could not explain and that she recognized, with a certainty
that defied logic, as scars she would one day receive.

The figure raised a hand. It pressed something against the viewport —
a sign, a piece of paper, a message. Vera leaned forward. The camera
struggled with the translucency, the resolution, the impossibility of
what it was recording. But the message was legible, barely, in block
letters that Vera recognized as her own handwriting:

OPEN CHANNEL 7

                               * * *

Channel 7 was the station's emergency frequency. It was reserved for
distress calls and was monitored continuously by the station's
automated systems, which meant that any transmission on Channel 7 would
be logged, time-stamped, and forwarded to Navigation Command. Vera
hesitated. If she opened Channel 7 and spoke to a ghost ship that did
not exist, the transmission would be in the record. It would be
reviewed. Questions would be asked.

She opened Channel 7.

"This is Waystation Nine," she said. "Operator Vera Koss. Transmitting
on Channel Seven. I am — " She paused. What was she? Attempting
communication with a visual anomaly that appeared to be wearing her
face? "I am responding to a signal. Please identify yourself."

Static. The flat, dead static of empty space. Then — threading through
the static like a voice calling from the bottom of a well — a voice.
Her voice.

"Vera. Thank God. I wasn't sure you'd see the sign."

Vera's fingers tightened on the console. The voice was hers — her voice,
her cadence, her flat midwestern vowels — but roughened, deepened,
stripped of the careful neutrality she maintained in her station logs.
It was the voice of someone who had stopped caring how she sounded.

"Who are you?" Vera asked.

"You know who I am. You're looking at me."

"I'm looking at someone who looks like me on a ship that doesn't exist.
That's not an identification."

A pause. Then something that might have been a laugh, dry and
mirthless. "Fair. All right. My name is Vera Koss. I was born in
Dayton, Ohio, on March 3rd, 2019. My mother's name was Helen. My
father's name was Frank. He died when I was fourteen, and I never told
anyone how, and I'm not going to tell you now, because you already
know, and if you don't, then I'm not you, and none of this matters."

Vera knew how her father died. She had never told anyone.

"Okay," she said. Her voice was steady, which was a professional
achievement of the first order. "You're me. Or a version of me. From
when?"

"From your future. Approximately eleven years from now. I don't — "
The voice broke. Reassembled. "I don't have much time. The ship only
stays for six hours, and I've been trying to reach you for — God, Vera.
I've been trying for so long."

"Trying to reach me? This is the first time I've seen you. The ship
has come four times and it's always been empty."

"It's not always empty. I've been on it every time. But you couldn't
see me. The — the interface is weak. The temporal displacement degrades
the signal. I'm barely here, Vera. I'm a ghost on a ghost ship. The
fact that you can see me this year means either the signal is getting
stronger or your perception is changing, and I don't know which."

"Where are you? I mean — where in time?"

"I don't know. I left the station five years from now — five years from
your now — and I went — out. Deep. There was a mission. A mapping
mission to the Oort Cloud. I volunteered because — " Another pause.
"Because I was tired of waiting. Because the solitude had become
something else, something worse than loneliness, and I thought that
going further out would help, the way scratching an itch helps even
when it makes it bleed."

"And?"

"And something happened. In the deep. Something I can't describe
because the words for it don't exist yet, because the human language
hasn't needed words for what happens when you go that far out and stay
that long. I — shifted. I fell through something. A fold, a seam, a
— a tear in the structure of time. And I've been falling ever since."

"The ship — "

"The ship is mine. The one they gave me for the Oort mission. It's
been falling with me. We're caught in something — a loop, a current,
a temporal eddy. We circle back. Every year, every October, we circle
back to this place, this station, this moment. For six hours. And then
the current takes us again, and we're gone, and I'm alone in the dark
between the moments, and I wait, and it comes back, and I come back,
and every year I press my face against the glass and try to make you
see me."

Vera's throat was tight. She swallowed. "I see you now."

"Yes. And I need you to help me. Because I can't get off this ship.
The loop won't let me. But you can — I think you can — pull me out.
If you open the airlock and extend the docking arm. If you create a
physical connection between the station and the ship. A bridge. The
loop is temporal, not spatial — the ship is really here, physically
here, for those six hours. The instruments can't see it, but it's
here. I've tested it. I've thrown objects out of the airlock and
they've drifted in real space. The ship is real. I'm real. I'm just
— stuck. And a bridge might be enough to break the loop."

"Or it might pull the station into the loop with you."

A long silence. Then: "Yes. It might."

                               III.

Vera sat in the control room and thought about time.

She had been thinking about time for four years, which was an
occupational hazard of living alone on a relay station in the trailing
Trojans, where the primary activity was waiting and the primary
experience was duration. She had thought about time the way a fish
thinks about water — not as a concept but as a medium, the substance
through which she moved and in which she was immersed. Four years of
time. Fifteen hundred days of it. Each one identical to the last, each
one marked by the same routines, the same maintenance tasks, the same
sunrise over the methane sea, the same stars in the same positions,
the same silence.

And now time had folded, and a version of herself from eleven years in
the future was stuck in a loop on a ghost ship three hundred meters
away, asking for help.

Vera ran the calculations. The docking arm was designed for supply
drones — small, automated vessels that arrived on a weekly schedule,
docked with the station for forty-five minutes, offloaded their cargo,
and departed. The arm could extend twelve meters. The ghost ship was
three hundred meters away. Even if Vera used the station's maneuvering
thrusters to close the distance, the approach would take — she checked
the thruster specifications, the station's mass, the fuel reserves —
approximately forty minutes. Which would leave five hours and twenty
minutes of the ghost ship's six-hour window for the docking attempt
and whatever came after.

If she did it. If she trusted a voice from a ghost ship. If she
believed that the scarred, aged version of herself looking back at her
from an impossible observation deck was real, and was really her, and
was really trapped, and really needed help.

"Tell me about the scars," Vera said, into Channel 7.

A pause. "Which ones?"

"On your face. The left side. They look deliberate."

A longer pause. "They are deliberate. I gave them to myself."

"Why?"

"Because after a while — after a long while in the loop — I needed to
prove that I was real. That I was physical. That I existed in a body
that could be marked, that could be changed. The loop is — it does
something to you, Vera. It makes you doubt. The same six hours, over
and over, the same view of the station, the same stars, the same
silence. After a while, you start to wonder if you're a recording.
A playback. A memory that the universe is replaying for no reason. And
the only way to prove you're not is to do something new. Something
that changes. So I — " Her voice was steady, but beneath the steadiness
was something that Vera recognized, because it was her own voice, and
she knew what it sounded like when it was covering something
unbearable. "I marked myself. One mark per loop. So I could count. So
I could know that each time was different, even if everything else was
the same."

"How many marks?"

Silence. Then: "You don't want to know."

Vera looked at the camera feed. The figure on the ghost ship's
observation deck was still there, still pressing its hands against the
viewport, still looking at her with those deep, scarred, impossible
eyes. Her eyes. Her future eyes.

"I'm going to try," Vera said. "I'm going to close the distance and
extend the docking arm. If it works — "

"If it works, I'm off the ship. I'm back. I'm real again."

"And if it doesn't work?"

"Then you've got eleven years before you find out the hard way what
happens when you go too far out."

Vera laughed. It was a short, surprised sound — she had not laughed in
weeks, and the laugh felt foreign in her mouth, like a word in a
language she was forgetting. "That's not reassuring."

"I'm you in eleven years. I'm not in the reassurance business
anymore."

                               * * *

Vera fired the maneuvering thrusters.

The station shuddered — a deep, structural tremor that she felt in her
teeth and her bones. Waystation Nine was not designed to maneuver. It
was designed to sit on its asteroid and relay signals and not move, and
the thrusters were emergency-only, installed for the theoretical
possibility of a collision avoidance maneuver that had never been
needed and was never expected to be needed. Using them to close a
three-hundred-meter gap with a ghost ship was exactly the kind of
improvisation that the station's designers had not anticipated and
would not have approved.

The station moved. Slowly, grudgingly, shedding bolts and groaning
through its structural members, it moved. The asteroid fell away below
— the moorings would hold; they were designed for the minor stresses
of orbital mechanics, not for intentional displacement, and they
stretched and complained but did not break. The ghost ship grew in the
viewport, its translucent hull becoming more substantial as the
distance closed, its details sharpening, its presence intensifying.

At fifty meters, Vera could see the ship clearly. It was a Consolidated
Freight Hauler, Model CF-7, a ship she recognized from the catalog
because she had memorized the catalog during her first year on the
station, having run out of other things to read. The hull markings
were — she squinted — illegible. Faded by time or translucency or
both. But the configuration was unmistakable: cargo bay, crew quarters,
observation blister, engine nacelles. A ship. A real ship. Dead and
haunted and caught in a loop of time, but real.

At twenty meters, the docking arm extended. It reached across the void
— twelve meters of articulated alloy, tipped with a magnetic coupling
that was designed for the standardized docking ports of supply drones.
The ghost ship's docking port was on its starboard side, and Vera used
the external cameras to guide the arm, and the arm moved with the slow,
deliberate precision of a hand reaching for something it is not sure
it wants to touch.

The coupling made contact.

The sound was — wrong. Not the clean metallic clank of a standard
docking. A softer sound, a deeper sound, like a bell rung underwater.
The station's instruments registered the contact as a pressure anomaly
— a brief spike in the hull stress sensors, followed by a pattern of
vibrations that the structural analysis software classified as
UNKNOWN and flagged for review.

"I felt that," said the voice on Channel 7. "The ship felt it. The
loop is — something's changing. The current is — " Her voice broke into
static, reformed. "Vera, open the airlock. I'm coming across."

Vera opened the airlock.

                               IV.

She waited in the airlock chamber, wearing her EVA suit, watching the
inner door of the docking arm. The arm was pressurized — a thin
atmosphere, barely breathable, maintained by the docking system's
auxiliary pumps. If the ghost ship's airlock opened, if the connection
held, if the physics of a temporal loop permitted a physical crossing —
then the person on the other side would step through the arm and into
the station's airlock, and Vera would be face to face with herself.

The docking arm trembled. The vibrations that the structural software
had classified as UNKNOWN were intensifying, and Vera could feel them
through the soles of her boots — a rhythmic pulsing that was almost,
but not quite, a heartbeat.

"I'm in the arm," the voice said. The comm signal was stronger now —
clearer, more present, as though the physical connection between ship
and station had strengthened the temporal signal as well. "It's dark
in here. But it's real. The metal is real. I can feel it. God, Vera,
I can feel something that isn't the ship. For the first time in — "
Static. "I'm coming."

Vera watched the inner door. The vibrations increased. The airlock's
pressure gauge fluctuated — a small oscillation, up and down, as though
two different atmospheres were negotiating.

The door opened.

The woman who stepped through was her.

Not a translucent ghost. Not a projection. Not a memory. A woman, in
a battered EVA suit, with Vera's face and Vera's build and Vera's
way of standing — slightly off-center, weight on the left foot, a
habit that her mother had tried to correct and that eleven years in a
temporal loop had apparently not fixed. The scars were vivid on the
left side of her face — thin, precise, white against the weathered
skin, too many to count at a glance.

She stood in the airlock and looked at Vera, and Vera looked at her,
and the distance between them — the eleven years and the loop and the
impossible physics of a ghost ship docking with a relay station in the
trailing Trojans on Halloween — collapsed into the space between two
women standing three feet apart, breathing the same thin air, looking
at each other with the same eyes.

"Hello, me," said the older Vera.

"Hello, you," said the younger.

And the older Vera smiled — a crooked, battered, beautiful smile that
Vera recognized as her own smile, the one she gave when something was
simultaneously terrible and funny — and she said, "I knew you'd do it.
I knew you'd open the door. Because I remember opening it. Because I
was you, and I opened it, and that's how time works: you can't change
what you've already done, but you can do what you've always been going
to do."

"That's a paradox."

"Everything about me is a paradox. Come on. The loop closes in four
hours, and I've been drinking recycled water for longer than you want
to know. Please tell me you have coffee."

"I have coffee."

"Then we have time."

They went inside. Behind them, the docking arm trembled, and the ghost
ship hung in the void, translucent and patient, and the stars turned
slowly around the station, and the clock counted down, and two versions
of Vera Koss — separated by eleven years and a fold in time and a
hundred scars that one of them had not yet received — sat in the
kitchen of Waystation Nine and drank coffee and talked, and outside
the viewport, the universe was dark and vast and strange, and inside
the station, for the first time in four years, Vera was not alone.

The loop closed at 05:47, as it always did. The ghost ship vanished.
The docking arm retracted, empty. The station settled back onto its
moorings, and the asteroid resumed its slow orbit, and the stars
returned to their normal positions, and Harold said, in his flat
monotone, "DOCKING ARM RETRACTED. AIRLOCK SEALED. ALL SYSTEMS NOMINAL."

And Vera Koss — the younger Vera, the current Vera, the one who had
four years behind her and an unknown number ahead — sat in the kitchen
with a second coffee cup cooling on the counter and a chair that was
still warm and a memory of a conversation that she would carry for the
rest of her life, and she thought about time, and she thought about
loops, and she thought about the scars on her future face, and she
decided — not to avoid them. Not to try to change the future. But to
be ready for it. To open the door, when the time came. To extend the
arm. To make the bridge.

Because that was how time worked: you couldn't change what you'd
already done. But you could do what you'd always been going to do. And
if what you'd always been going to do was save yourself — your own
self, your future self, your impossible scarred beautiful self — then
the paradox was not a trap but a promise.

She washed the two coffee cups and set them on the rack to dry.

Next year, she would be ready.

                            [THE END]

                          TOOTH AND CLAW

                               I.

The kids had been planning their costumes for a month.

On Kepler-62f, where the colony of New Fayette had put down roots three
years ago, October was a relative concept — the planet's year was two
hundred and sixty-seven Earth days, and its axial tilt produced seasons
that bore only a passing resemblance to Earth's. But the colonists kept
the Earth calendar, the way sailors keep Greenwich time: a thread of
continuity, a reminder of where they came from and what they had been.
And when the Earth calendar said October, the children of New Fayette
put on costumes and went trick-or-treating, because children are
children on any world, and Halloween is Halloween.

Tom Adler was ten years old and he was going as a Rigellian sand-wasp.
His mother, Claire, had spent two weekends constructing the costume from
scrap fabric and wire, and the result was, by any objective standard,
terrible — the wings drooped, the stinger was crooked, and the
compound eyes were made from jar lids painted red — but Tom wore it
with the fierce pride of a ten-year-old who does not care about
objective standards and who knows, with perfect certainty, that he is
the most terrifying creature on the planet.

Maisie Chen was eight and she was a robot. Her costume was a cardboard
box with armholes cut in the sides and a colander on her head. She
walked with a stiff-legged robot walk and said "DOES NOT COMPUTE" every
time an adult asked her a question, and she had been doing this for
three days straight, which was driving her parents to the brink.

Peter Okafor was twelve, which meant he was almost too old for trick-
or-treating but not quite willing to admit it. He had compromised by
going as a spaceship pilot — his own flight jacket, a pair of goggles
he had made from wire and bottle glass, and an attitude of studied
nonchalance that fooled no one.

And then there was the new one. The child none of them knew.

                               * * *

The colony of New Fayette was small — forty-three families, two hundred
and seven people, living in a cluster of prefabricated buildings on a
cleared plateau at the edge of the continental jungle. The jungle was
the dominant feature of Kepler-62f: a vast, dense, wet tangle of alien
vegetation that covered eighty percent of the planet's landmass and that
the colonists regarded with a mixture of respect, fear, and agricultural
ambition. The trees — they were not trees, exactly, but the colonists
called them trees because they were tall and had trunks and something
like leaves — grew to heights of sixty meters and produced a canopy so
thick that the forest floor existed in perpetual twilight. The
underbrush was dense with organisms that the colony's biologists were
still cataloguing: crawlers, climbers, burrowers, things that
fluoresced in the dark and things that did not and things that were
difficult to see under any light, because they had evolved not to be
seen.

The colonists had cleared a perimeter around New Fayette — a two-
hundred-meter strip of bare earth between the buildings and the tree
line. The perimeter was maintained by controlled burns and chemical
treatments, and it served as a buffer between the human world and the
alien one. The children knew the rules: you could go anywhere inside
the perimeter, but you did not go into the jungle. You did not approach
the tree line. You did not, under any circumstances, go through the
gap.

The gap was an opening in the perimeter on the colony's eastern edge,
where the access road ran from the colony to the shuttle landing field.
It was the one place where the jungle came close — where the trees
pressed in on both sides of the road and the canopy closed overhead
and the twilight of the forest floor crept up to the edge of the human
world like an animal testing the limits of a cage.

The children knew about the gap. They told stories about it. They dared
each other to walk into it. None of them ever had.

                               II.

The trick-or-treating began at dusk.

Dusk on Kepler-62f was a long, slow affair — the planet's rotation was
thirty-one hours, and the transitions between day and night were
gradual, the sky cycling through colors that had no Earth equivalents:
a pale, yellowish green that deepened to teal, then to a blue so dark
it was almost purple, before the stars appeared. The colonists had
learned to love the long dusks. They sat on their porches and watched
the sky change and talked, and the talking was easy and warm and
neighborly, the way talking is in small communities on the edges of
vast, inhospitable spaces.

Tom Adler led the group. This was by virtue of personality rather than
age — Peter was older, but Peter's studied nonchalance made him a
reluctant leader, and Tom had the kind of focused, irrepressible energy
that colonist children seemed to develop as a survival trait, as though
the planet itself demanded vitality as the price of living on it.

They moved from house to house, following the main street of New
Fayette, which was a packed-earth road lined with prefab buildings that
the colonists had personalized with paint and gardens and hand-carved
signs. Each house had a light on — the colonists had agreed on this,
a signal that trick-or-treaters were welcome — and at each door, an
adult appeared with a bowl of something sweet. The colony did not have
candy in the Earth sense, but the cooks had developed confections from
local sugars and starches that were passable, and the children accepted
them with the same ritual solemnity that children on Earth accepted
candy: a chorus of "trick or treat," an evaluation of the offering, a
whispered negotiation over trades.

They were halfway down the main street when Maisie noticed the new
kid.

"Who's that?" she said, tugging Tom's wing.

Tom looked. A child was walking behind them — thirty meters back, at
the edge of the porch lights' reach. The child was in costume: a full-
body suit of dark material, covering everything from head to toe, with
a mask that covered the face. The costume was elaborate — more elaborate
than anything the colony's parents had the time or materials to produce.
The dark material had a sheen to it, a quality of texture that caught
the light oddly, and the mask was smooth and featureless except for two
eye holes that were darker than the surrounding material, which should
not have been possible, because the material was already dark.

"I don't know," Tom said. "Hey!" he called out. "Hey, come on up!
We're going to the Hendersons' next. They've got the good stuff."

The child did not respond. It stood at the edge of the light, its
smooth dark mask turned toward them, and it did not move.

"Weird," Peter said. "Whose kid is that?"

"I don't know," Tom repeated. He cupped his hands around his mouth.
"Hey! Come on! What are you supposed to be?"

The child tilted its head. A slow, deliberate motion, like a bird
regarding something on the ground. Then it took a step forward. One
step. Into the light.

The costume, in better light, was — wrong. Tom could not say how. The
dark material fit too closely to the body beneath it, as though it had
been molded rather than sewn. The mask was seamless — no visible edges
where it met the suit, no straps, no fasteners. And the eye holes were
not holes. They were indentations. Depressions in the smooth surface
that gave the impression of eyes without actually being openings
through which eyes could look.

"That's a great costume," Maisie said. "DOES NOT COMPUTE. What are
you?"

The child did not answer. It stood in the light and regarded them with
its blank, indented eyes, and its head was still tilted at that
birdlike angle, and it was very, very still.

"Come on," Tom said, to the others. He was ten years old, and he was
not afraid — not yet — but something in the stillness of the child
behind them made him want to keep moving. "Let's hit the rest of the
street. The new kid can follow if they want."

They moved on. At the next house, Tom looked back. The child was
following. It had closed the distance to twenty meters, and it moved
with a strange, fluid gait that Tom could not quite describe — a walk
that was smooth in a way that human walking was not, as though the
joints bent differently, or as though there were more joints than
there should have been.

"Peter," Tom said, quietly. "That kid is weird."

"Yeah." Peter's studied nonchalance had evaporated. He was watching the
child with the focused attention of a twelve-year-old who has
recognized, at the animal level below language and reason, that
something is wrong. "Tom. How many kids are in the colony?"

"Fifty-two. Why?"

"I can name every one of them. I know every kid in New Fayette. I know
their parents. I know their houses." He paused. "I don't know that
kid."

They looked at the child. It had stopped again, standing at the edge
of the light from the Hendersons' porch. It was watching them. Its
head was tilted. Its dark, featureless mask reflected the porch light
in a way that gave its blank face a suggestion of expression — not a
specific expression, but the implication that an expression existed
beneath the surface, waiting to emerge.

"Maybe they're from the science station," Maisie said. "The one in
the valley."

"The science station doesn't have kids," Peter said.

"Maybe they're visiting."

"Nobody visits New Fayette. We're on the edge of settled space. Nobody
comes here who doesn't have to."

"Then who — "

"I don't know." Peter straightened up. He walked toward the child.
"Hey," he said. His voice was firm, the way his father's voice was firm
when his father was dealing with a situation. "Hey. I'm Peter. What's
your name?"

The child looked at him. Its head leveled, slowly, from its birdlike
tilt. It was shorter than Peter by a head. It stood in its dark,
seamless costume and regarded him, and Peter was close enough now to see
that the surface of the costume was not fabric. It was not any material
he recognized. It had a quality — a texture — that reminded him of
something he had seen in the jungle, on a school trip to the perimeter,
when the biology teacher had pointed out the camouflage adaptations of
the local fauna. The way certain organisms could alter the surface
properties of their skin to match their surroundings. The way the
surface rippled, subtly, as the organism beneath it breathed.

The child's costume rippled.

Peter stepped back.

"We should go home," he said.

                               III.

They went home. Not running — Peter was twelve, and twelve-year-olds do
not run — but quickly, their candy bags clutched against their chests,
their costumes suddenly ridiculous and flimsy, Tom's sand-wasp wings
catching the wind and pulling him sideways, Maisie's cardboard box
banging against her legs. The child followed.

It did not hurry. It maintained its distance — twenty meters, now
fifteen, now ten — with the patient, unhurried gait of something that
does not need to hurry because it knows where its quarry is going.

Tom's house was third from the end of the main street. His mother was
on the porch, a bowl of sweets in her lap, talking to the Webbers from
next door. She looked up as the children came down the street.

"Back already? You haven't done the north side yet."

"Mom," Tom said. "There's a kid following us."

Claire Adler looked past her son. She saw the main street, the porch
lights, the dark shapes of houses against the deeper dark of the Kepler
sky. "I don't see anyone, honey."

Tom turned around. The street was empty.

"It was right there," he said. "Right behind us. A kid in a dark
costume. A really weird costume. It was following us."

"Probably one of the Jensen kids. They're always — "

"It wasn't a Jensen kid. It wasn't any kid I know. It was — " He
stopped. He did not know what to say. The words he had were
insufficient: a kid in a costume, following them down the street. It
sounded like nothing. It sounded like Halloween. But the feeling — the
tight, cold thing in his chest, the thing that had made Peter say
we should go home in a voice that did not sound like Peter — the
feeling was not nothing.

"Come inside," Claire said. "It's getting late. You can do the north
side tomorrow."

They went inside. Claire herded Tom upstairs, negotiated the removal
of the sand-wasp costume, supervised the brushing of teeth, and
performed the nightly ritual of tucking in. Tom was ten and considered
himself too old for tucking in, but he did not object tonight, and
Claire noticed this and filed it in the parental database of things
to monitor.

"You okay, bug?" she said, sitting on the edge of his bed.

"Yeah. Mom? Can you leave the hall light on?"

"Sure."

She left the hall light on and went downstairs to clean up. The
Webbers had gone home. The porch light was still on. She turned it off,
locked the front door, and went to the kitchen to wash the candy bowl.

The back door was open.

Claire stopped. The back door was — she was certain she had locked it
before the trick-or-treating started. She was meticulous about the
doors. All the colonists were. The perimeter kept the jungle out, but
the habit of locking doors was older than the colony, older than space
travel, older than memory, and Claire Adler locked her doors every
night with the thoroughness of a woman who understood, at the bone
level, that the dark outside was not empty.

The back door was open. Not wide — just ajar, a hand's width of
darkness visible between the door and the frame. The night air came
through the gap, warm and wet, carrying the smell of the jungle:
the dense, organic, alien smell that the colonists had learned to
associate with the world outside the perimeter, the world of tall trees
and crawling things and organisms that had evolved not to be seen.

Claire went to the door and closed it. She locked it. She checked the
lock. She stood in the kitchen and listened to the house — the creak of
the walls as they cooled, the hum of the air processor, the distant
sound of Tom shifting in his bed.

She went upstairs. Tom was asleep. She stood in his doorway and watched
him breathe, and everything was normal, everything was ordinary,
everything was the quiet domestic routine of a colony house at the end
of Halloween, and she went to bed and she slept, and in the morning
everything was fine.

In the morning, everything was fine.

                               IV.

But.

In the morning, Tom came downstairs and said, "Mom, there's mud on
the kitchen floor."

Claire came to look. There were tracks on the kitchen floor — small
tracks, child-sized, leading from the back door to the hallway and
back. The mud was dark red — Kepler mud, the iron-rich soil of the
plateau — and the tracks were barefoot.

"Did you go outside last night?" Claire asked.

"No."

"You're sure?"

"I was in bed. I didn't go anywhere."

Claire looked at the tracks. They were small — smaller than Tom's
feet. The toes were — she knelt down and looked more closely. The toes
were wrong. There were too many of them. Not dramatically too many —
not six or seven where five should be. But the impressions in the mud
suggested — she was not sure what they suggested. The shape was
approximately human, the size was approximately child, but the
proportions were slightly off, the way a very good drawing of a foot
is slightly off when drawn by someone who has seen feet but never
owned one.

She cleaned the floor. She checked the back door. It was locked. She
checked the windows. All locked. She checked the perimeter from the
front porch — the two-hundred-meter strip of bare earth was intact,
unbroken, the jungle a dark wall on the far side.

She told herself it was Tom. That he had gone outside in his sleep — he
had sleepwalked once, two years ago, on the colony ship — and that the
odd shape of the footprints was a trick of the mud, a smearing, a
distortion. She told herself this and she almost believed it.

That evening, Peter Okafor's mother called. "Claire, did Peter come
over to your place last night? After trick-or-treating?"

"No. Why?"

"He says something was in his room last night. He woke up and something
was standing at the foot of his bed. Watching him. He says it was
wearing a dark costume."

Claire's hand tightened on the phone. "What did he do?"

"He pulled the covers over his head and didn't move until morning.
He's twelve and he pulled the covers over his head, Claire. He hasn't
done that since he was six. He won't go outside."

"Did you find anything? In the room?"

"Mud. On the floor. By the window."

Claire went to Tom's room. She checked the floor. She checked the
windowsill. She got down on her knees and looked under the bed, feeling
foolish and afraid in equal measure.

Under the bed, pressed against the wall, was a handprint.

It was small. It was dark red. It was on the baseboard, as though a
small hand had pressed against it for balance while something crouched
in the space beneath the bed. The fingers — Claire counted them — the
fingers were too long. Not dramatically too long. Just enough to be
wrong.

She stared at the handprint. The handprint stared back, in the way that
evidence stares — mutely, irrefutably, without comment or explanation.

She called a colony meeting.

                               * * *

The meeting was held in the community hall — the largest building in New
Fayette, a prefab structure that served as school, church, town hall,
and social center. Forty-one of the colony's forty-three families
attended. The Matsudas were at the science station in the valley. The
Brennans were on leave in the orbital.

Claire told them what Tom had seen on Halloween. Peter's mother told
them what Peter had found. Three other families came forward with
similar reports: children who had seen a figure in a dark costume, mud
tracks in the house, windows and doors found open in the morning.

The colony's security officer, a steady, methodical man named Hank
Reeves who had been a police detective in Baton Rouge before emigrating,
listened to all of it with the attentive patience of someone sorting
data.

"Let me make sure I have this right," he said. "On Halloween night,
multiple children reported seeing an unknown child in a dark costume.
That night or the following nights, several homes showed evidence of
entry — mud tracks, open doors. The tracks are child-sized but
anomalous in shape. Nobody was harmed. Nothing was taken. But the entry
is real and the tracks are real."

"Yes," Claire said.

"And the costume the children described — dark, seamless, form-fitting,
no visible face?"

"Yes."

"That's not a costume," said Dr. Lena Vasquez, the colony's chief
biologist. She was sitting in the front row, and she had been quiet
until now, and the quality of her quiet had been the quiet of someone
assembling a picture from pieces that do not want to fit together.
"I've been studying the fauna of this continent for two years. The
dominant predatory organisms in the jungle use a form of adaptive
camouflage — a surface integument that can alter its color, texture,
and reflectivity to match the surroundings. In the jungle, they look
like bark, like leaves, like shadow. In the open, they look like — "

She stopped.

"Like what?" Reeves asked.

"Like whatever they need to look like. The camouflage is not just
visual. It's structural. The integument can alter its surface geometry
to mimic shapes. Simple shapes — the outline of a rock, the curve of
a root. But some of the larger organisms — the ones we've only observed
at a distance, through the drones — the larger ones can mimic more
complex shapes."

The room was very quiet.

"Like a child," Claire said.

"Like the general outline of a child. The proportions wouldn't be
exactly right. The movement would be slightly wrong. And the face —
the integument can produce shapes but not features. It would be smooth.
Blank. With indentations where the eyes should be."

The silence in the room was the silence of forty-one families
understanding, simultaneously, that the thing their children had seen
on Halloween was not a child in a costume. It was something from the
jungle, something that had watched the children through the gap in the
perimeter, something that had observed the shapes and sizes and
movements of human children and had mimicked them, imperfectly,
sufficiently, and had walked among them, and had followed them home,
and had come inside.

"It came through the gap," Reeves said.

"Yes."

"And it went into the houses."

"Yes."

"And it — " He chose his words. "What does it want?"

Dr. Vasquez looked at him. "I don't know. The organisms I've studied
are predators. But they're ambush predators — they mimic and they wait.
They don't pursue. They don't enter enclosed spaces. This behavior
is — new."

"New, or new to us?"

"Both."

Reeves stood. He was a practical man, and practical men, when
confronted with an unknown threat, fall back on protocol. "We close
the gap. Tonight. We reinforce the perimeter. We check every house,
every basement, every crawl space. And we don't let the children
outside after dark until we know what we're dealing with."

The colony agreed. The gap was closed that night with heavy equipment
and chemical barriers. Every house was searched. Nothing was found.

But Tom Adler lay in bed that night, in his locked house, behind the
reinforced perimeter, with the hall light on and the covers pulled to
his chin, and he listened to the house breathe around him, and he
heard, or thought he heard, or imagined he heard, a sound from beneath
his bed.

A sound like breathing. Slow. Patient. Familiar, in the way that a
child's breathing is familiar, because children breathe the same
everywhere, on every world, in every dark room, under every bed.

He did not look.

He lay very still, and he breathed, and the breathing beneath his bed
breathed with him, and outside the window the Kepler night was dark
and warm and full of things that had learned, over millions of years
of evolution, to look like something they were not.

And in the jungle, beyond the perimeter, beyond the closed gap and
the chemical barriers and the lights that the colonists burned against
the dark, something watched, and something waited, and something
learned.

It had been inside. It had seen the small ones, the warm ones, the
ones that moved and spoke and slept. It had stood at the foot of a
bed and watched a warm thing breathe, and it had breathed with it, and
the breathing had taught it something that the watching from the gap
had not.

It had learned that the door was not the only way in.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                          THE PASSENGER

                        by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                               I.

The woman across the aisle had my face.

I noticed her on the second day out from Ganymede Station, though she
may have been there from the beginning. The transport was the Meridian
— a mid-class passenger vessel on the Jupiter-to-Mars run, eight days
in transit, carrying forty-seven souls in economy berths and a crew of
twelve. I was in berth twenty-three, port side. She was in berth
twenty-four, starboard.

I say she had my face, and I want to be clear about what I mean. I do
not mean she resembled me. I do not mean she had similar features — the
same coloring, the same bone structure, the kind of resemblance that
strangers sometimes share and that produces a moment of startled
recognition in a crowd. I mean she had my face. My exact face. The nose
I had broken at fourteen, falling off a tractor. The scar on the chin
from the barbed wire fence on my grandfather's property. The way the
left eye sat slightly lower than the right — an asymmetry so subtle
that only I knew it was there, because I had spent thirty-one years
looking at it in mirrors.

My face, exactly. But old.

Not old the way I would get old — the natural aging that time and
gravity and weather would produce over the course of decades. This was
a different kind of old. This was the aging of someone who had been
through something — something specific, something violent, something
that had left marks. The skin around the eyes was creased not with
laugh lines but with the deeper furrows that come from squinting
against pain, or wind, or light that is too bright. The mouth was set
in a line that was not a frown but the absence of any expression at
all, the blank neutrality of someone who has learned that expressions
are a vulnerability. And the scars — there were scars that I did not
have. A thin line across the forehead. A thicker one along the jaw. A
mark on the left cheek that looked like a burn, old and faded, the
skin tight and shiny where it had healed.

She sat in her berth with her hands in her lap and her eyes forward,
and she did not move, and she did not speak, and I watched her for an
hour before I realized that she cast no shadow.

                               * * *

The light in the Meridian's economy section came from overhead panels —
flat, white, institutional, the kind of light that exists not to
illuminate but to prevent darkness. It fell on everything equally: the
rows of berths, the narrow aisle, the passengers in their seats, and
the bulkhead at the far end of the section. Everything in the light
cast a shadow. The man in berth twenty-two, who was large and read
technical manuals and snored. The woman in berth twenty-five, who knit
constantly and whose needles made a soft, rhythmic clicking that was
the heartbeat of the economy section. The child in berth thirty, who
fidgeted and whined and was alternately scolded and consoled by the
patient father beside her.

All of them cast shadows. The woman in berth twenty-four did not.

The light fell on her the same as it fell on everyone else. It
illuminated her face, her hands, the dark fabric of her clothing. But
where the light should have produced a shadow — on the seat behind her,
on the floor beneath her feet, on the bulkhead to her right — there
was nothing. The light passed through her, or around her, or was not
affected by her at all, as though she were not an object in the world
but a picture of one — a two-dimensional image pasted onto the three-
dimensional space of the economy section, perfectly convincing from the
front but possessing no depth, no volume, no substance that the light
could interact with.

I watched for the shadow for the rest of the day. I watched from
different angles, in different lighting conditions — during the
artificial "day" cycle, when the overhead panels were at full
brightness, and during the "evening" cycle, when they dimmed to a warm
amber. In every condition, the result was the same. No shadow.

I told myself I was wrong. I told myself it was a trick of the
lighting, an angle, a coincidence. The economy section was not designed
for careful observation — it was designed for the efficient transport
of human bodies from one point to another, and its lighting was
functional, not diagnostic. There could be a shadow that I was missing.
A faint one, an attenuated one, visible only from an angle I had not
tried.

But I had been a farmer's daughter in Kansas, and a farmer's daughter
in Kansas learns to trust her eyes, because her eyes are the tools
she uses to read the weather and the soil and the health of the
livestock, and they do not lie, and my eyes told me that the woman in
berth twenty-four cast no shadow.

                               II.

On the third day, I noticed the sound.

Or rather, I noticed the absence of sound. The economy section of the
Meridian was a noisy place — forty-seven people in a confined space
produce a constant, ambient sound: breathing, shifting, coughing,
talking, the rustle of clothing, the creak of berth frames. Each person
contributed to this ambient sound. Each person was a source of small,
continuous noises that blended into the background and became, after a
day or two, as invisible as the hum of the ship's engines.

The woman in berth twenty-four produced no sound.

I listened carefully. I listened during the quiet hours, when most of
the passengers were sleeping and the ambient noise dropped to its
minimum — the hum of the engines, the whisper of the air processors,
the occasional snore or murmur. In this relative silence, every small
sound was audible: the click of the knitter's needles, the turn of a
page, the creak of a berth as a sleeper shifted weight. But from berth
twenty-four: nothing. No breathing. No shifting. No rustle of fabric.
No sound at all.

She sat in her berth, motionless, silent, shadowless, and she looked
straight ahead with those scarred, aged, impossible eyes, and she
did not acknowledge any of the passengers around her, and none of the
passengers around her acknowledged her.

This was the third thing I noticed, and it was the most disturbing.

The crew did not see her.

I watched the steward make his rounds — a young man named Ortiz, who
moved through the economy section three times a day with a cart of
ration packets and water cups. He handed a packet to the man in berth
twenty-two. He skipped berth twenty-four. He handed a packet to the
woman in berth twenty-five. He did not pause, did not hesitate, did
not glance at the occupied berth between them. His eyes moved from
twenty-two to twenty-five as though twenty-four did not exist, as
though the berth were empty.

I watched the other passengers. The man in twenty-two looked to his
left — toward me, in twenty-three — and looked to his right — toward
the knitter in twenty-five — and never once looked across the aisle at
twenty-four. The knitter in twenty-five oriented her body slightly
away from the aisle, as people do when they want to avoid interaction
with an adjacent stranger, but her avoidance was not directed at berth
twenty-four. It was directed at the aisle in general. She did not
know that berth twenty-four was occupied. None of them did.

I was the only one who could see her.

                               * * *

On the fourth day, I spoke to Ortiz.

"The woman in twenty-four," I said, when he reached my berth with the
ration cart. "Has she eaten?"

Ortiz looked at me. He looked at berth twenty-four. He looked back
at me. "Twenty-four is empty, ma'am."

"It's not empty. There's a woman sitting right there."

He looked again. His eyes moved over the berth — the seat, the
headrest, the small storage compartment beneath — and I could see that
he was looking at an empty berth. Not pretending it was empty. Not
ignoring an occupant. Looking at a berth that was, for him, genuinely,
completely empty.

"There's nobody there, ma'am. Twenty-four has been empty since
Ganymede."

"She's right there. She's sitting in the seat. She's wearing dark
clothes. She has scars on her face."

Ortiz's expression shifted. A careful, neutral shift — the expression
of a service worker who has been trained to manage difficult passengers
without confrontation. "I'll make a note for the captain, ma'am. Can
I get you anything? Water?"

"I don't want water. I want you to look at berth twenty-four."

"I'm looking at it, ma'am. It's empty."

I closed my mouth. I looked at the woman in berth twenty-four. She was
looking at me. For the first time since I had noticed her, she was
looking directly at me, and her eyes — my eyes, aged, scarred, emptied
of something I could not name — were steady, and calm, and full of a
knowledge that I did not want to share.

"Never mind," I said to Ortiz. "Water would be fine."

                               III.

On the fifth day, I spoke to her.

I did not plan it. I had spent the fourth night lying in my berth,
staring at the ceiling, thinking about shadows and sounds and the
selective invisibility of a woman who wore my face. I had considered
the possibilities. Hallucination: possible, but I had no history of
hallucination, no medication, no illness that would produce one.
Optical illusion: possible, but an illusion does not sit in a berth for
four days without moving. Mental illness: possible, but I felt sane —
sane in the specific, grounded, practical way that a Kansas farm girl
feels sane, the sanity of someone whose reality is calibrated by the
daily evidence of the physical world. Ghosts: not possible, because
ghosts were not real.

But the woman in berth twenty-four was not real either, by any
definition that included casting shadows and making sounds and being
visible to other people, and yet there she was.

On the fifth morning, I got up from my berth, crossed the aisle, and
sat down in the empty berth next to hers — twenty-six, which was
genuinely empty; I had checked the manifest.

"My name is Ruth Cawley," I said. "I'm from Salina, Kansas. I'm on
my way to Mars to start a job at the Borealis agricultural station.
I'm thirty-one years old. I'm not crazy. And I can see you."

The woman turned her head.

It was the first movement I had seen her make. A slow, deliberate
rotation of the head, from forward-facing to facing me, and the
movement was wrong — not in any way I could describe, but wrong, the
way a movement is wrong when it is performed by someone who has
forgotten how movement works, or who has not moved in a very long
time, or who is not entirely present in the body that is moving.

She looked at me. My face looked at me. My face, twenty years older,
marked with scars I had not received, aged by events I had not
experienced, wearing an expression that I had never worn — the blank,
careful expression of someone who has learned to show nothing because
showing anything is dangerous.

She opened her mouth. No sound came out. Her lips moved — I could see
them move — but the air between us remained silent, as though the words
she was speaking existed in a frequency that the atmosphere could not
carry.

"I can't hear you," I said.

She closed her mouth. She looked at me. Then she raised her hand — her
right hand, my right hand, the hand I used to drive the tractor and
mend fences and write letters to my mother — and she touched her face.
She touched the scar on her forehead. She touched the burn on her
cheek. She touched the thick line along her jaw. She touched each scar
in turn, deliberately, as though cataloguing them, as though showing
them to me. As though saying: these are yours. These are coming. These
belong to you.

I sat in berth twenty-six and watched myself show me the future
written on my skin, and the transport hummed around us, and the other
passengers read and slept and talked, and none of them looked at us,
and the overhead light fell on the woman in berth twenty-four and
produced no shadow, and I was afraid.

Not of her. Of what she was telling me. Of the map of damage on her
face — my face, my future face — and what it said about the road
between here and there. About the years between thirty-one and
fifty-one. About what was coming.

"What happened to you?" I whispered.

She looked at me. She did not answer, because she could not answer,
because whatever she was — ghost, echo, temporal anomaly, projection
from a future that had not yet occurred — she existed outside the
medium of sound, outside the medium of shadow, outside the medium of
other people's perception. She existed only for me. She was visible
only to me. She was a message addressed to me and me alone, written
in the language of scars.

She raised her hand again. She pointed at me. Then she pointed at
herself. Then she held up her hands, palms out, and I could see the
scars on her palms too — old scars, white and ridged, the kind of
scars that come from gripping something too tightly for too long.
She held up her scarred palms, and she looked at me with my own eyes,
and the look said: this is you. This will be you. You cannot stop it.
But you can survive it. Look at me. I am the proof that you survive.

I looked at her. I looked at the scars. I looked at the face that was
my face, aged and marked and worn but present — alive, if a shadowless,
soundless figure on a transport could be called alive. Alive in the
way that a scar is alive: tissue that has healed, that has closed over
a wound, that is different from the original skin but is still skin,
still covering, still holding the body together.

"Will I be all right?" I asked.

She looked at me for a long time. Then she did something I had not
expected. She smiled. A small, worn, deeply tired smile that used
muscles I could feel in my own face, that I recognized as my smile —
the smile I gave when something was hard and I was doing it anyway,
the smile my mother called my Kansas smile, the one that said: the
wheat is dying and the well is dry and the dust is coming, and I am
still here.

She smiled that smile, and then she turned away, back to her forward-
facing position, and she was still, and I sat beside her for a long
time, and I did not speak again, and neither did she.

                               IV.

She was gone on the sixth morning.

I woke in my berth and looked across the aisle, and berth twenty-four
was empty. Not empty in the way it had been empty for Ortiz and the
other passengers — empty for them, occupied for me. Empty for everyone.
Empty completely. The seat was in its upright position. The storage
compartment was closed. The berth was clean and bare and ordinary, and
the overhead light fell on it and produced a shadow — the shadow of the
seat back on the bulkhead — and the shadow was normal and expected and
real.

She was gone.

I got up. I crossed the aisle. I sat in berth twenty-four — her berth,
my berth, the berth of the woman I would become — and I put my hands
on the armrests and felt nothing. No warmth. No residue. No trace. The
seat was just a seat, and the berth was just a berth, and the woman
who had worn my face and shown me my scars was gone as though she had
never been there.

But she had been there. I knew this the way I knew the weather — not
through instruments or logic but through the body's knowledge, the
deep, pre-verbal certainty that comes from paying attention to the
world. She had been there. She had looked at me. She had shown me
what was coming. And then she had gone, because the message had been
delivered, and the message was simple, and the message was this:

It will be hard. You will be marked. You will carry scars you cannot
yet imagine, from wounds you cannot yet foresee. But you will carry
them. You will be there, on the other side of whatever is coming,
scarred and shadowless and silent, but there. Present. Surviving.

I sat in the empty berth and I thought about the scars. The one on
the forehead. The burn on the cheek. The line along the jaw. The marks
on the palms. I did not know what would cause them. I did not know
when. I did not know if knowing would help — if foreknowledge was a
shield or just a more refined form of fear.

But I knew that the woman on the other side of those scars had smiled.
She had smiled my mother's smile, my grandmother's smile, the smile
of women who endure because enduring is what they know how to do. And
the smile had said: you will get through this. Not easily. Not without
cost. But through.

I went back to my berth. I ate my ration packet. I drank my water.
The transport hummed around me. The passengers read and slept and
talked. The knitter's needles clicked. The child in berth thirty
fidgeted.

Mars was three days away. My new job was waiting. My new life was
waiting, with whatever it contained — the wounds, the scars, the events
that would mark me and age me and change me into the woman I had seen.
I did not know what was coming. I only knew that I would survive it,
because I had seen the proof, and the proof had my face.

I looked out the viewport. The stars were steady and cold and very far
away, and the transport moved through them like a small, warm thing
carrying its small, warm cargo through the vast indifference of space,
and I was not afraid.

Or I was afraid, but I was going anyway.

Which is, I suppose, the same thing.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                      DEAD SATELLITES SPELLING

                     by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

The first thing Mack Dunbar noticed about Graveyard Sigma was the
silence.

Not the quiet-of-space silence that every void-walker knew — the kind
you got used to, the kind that was just the absence of atmosphere doing
what the absence of atmosphere does. This was different. This was a
silence with weight to it. A silence that pressed against the hull of
the salvage tug "Bucket List" like a hand against a coffin lid.

"We're on approach," said Rita Chen from the pilot's chair. She didn't
look up from her instruments. She didn't need to. The forward viewport
told the whole story: two hundred and seventeen dead satellites
tumbling in a loose orbital cluster, catching the sun in irregular
flashes that made the whole field look like a swarm of dying fireflies.
"Sigma Control confirms clearance. We're good for entry."

"Good for entry," Dunbar repeated. He said it the way a man repeats the
doctor's assurance that the lump is probably nothing. "Right."

He stood at the observation rail of the tug's bridge and watched the
dead machines turn. They were a mixed bag — old weather satellites from
the Sixties, burned-out relay stations from the early colonial push,
military hardware with the insignia sandblasted off by micrometeorites,
survey platforms whose solar panels hung like broken wings. The
Interplanetary Salvage Commission had flagged Graveyard Sigma for
reclamation six months ago: too much debris in a shipping lane, too
many near-misses with cargo haulers running the Earth-Mars corridor.
Somebody had to go in, tag the junk, and haul it down for recycling.

That somebody was Dunbar's crew.

"Picking up the rest of the survey on scan," said Leo Tranh from the
sensor station. Leo was young, dark-eyed, with the cautious hands of a
man who'd grown up disarming ordnance in the Martian mining camps. He
was the best sensor operator Dunbar had ever worked with, which was why
Dunbar had hired him and also why Dunbar sometimes wanted to throw him
out an airlock — Leo's readings were always precise, always reliable,
and almost never what you wanted to hear. "Two hundred and seventeen
objects confirmed. Mass distribution consistent with the ISC catalog.
No anomalies."

"See?" said Rita. "No anomalies. Just dead satellites. Scrap metal and
old solar cells."

"And the reactivation reports?" Dunbar asked.

Rita didn't answer right away. She adjusted something on her console
that didn't need adjusting. "ISC says the reports are unconfirmed.
Shipping crews see things. You know how it is."

Dunbar knew how it was. He'd been running salvage operations in orbital
graveyards for fourteen years, starting with the small debris fields in
low Earth orbit and working his way up to the big reclamation jobs in
the shipping lanes. He'd heard every ghost story the void had to offer:
phantom signals from decommissioned stations, navigation beacons that
turned themselves back on, the old legend about the Soviet probe that
came back from Venus with something living in its sample return capsule.
Spacers were superstitious people. It came with the territory.

But the reports from Graveyard Sigma were specific. Three independent
cargo crews, over a period of two months, had reported the same thing:
dead satellites in the graveyard were reactivating. Not all of them —
just some. Their solar panels were repositioning. Their attitude
thrusters were firing in coordinated bursts. And when you looked at
the graveyard from a distance — from the perspective of someone on the
surface of Earth, say, or from one of the orbital observation
platforms — the reactivated satellites had arranged themselves into a
pattern.

A pattern that looked like letters.

"Sigma Control, this is Bucket List," Rita said into the comm. "We are
entering the debris field now. Beginning initial survey."

"Copy, Bucket List. Be advised: we have updated telemetry showing
repositioning activity in sectors four through nine. Three additional
units have changed orientation since your departure from Ceres."

Rita looked at Dunbar. Dunbar looked at the dead satellites turning in
the sunlight.

"Copy that, Sigma Control," he said. "We'll take a look."

                               * * *

The Bucket List was a Kessler-class salvage tug — ugly, squat, built
like a garbage truck with thrusters. She carried a crew of five: Dunbar
as salvage master, Rita on the stick, Leo on sensors, Pete Kovacs
handling the grapple arms and cutting gear, and Dr. Sana Osei running
the onboard analysis lab. She was not a glamorous ship. She did not
inspire songs or stories. She did exactly what she was designed to do:
go into fields of dead machinery and bring the pieces home.

Pete Kovacs was in the cargo bay when Dunbar came down to suit up. Pete
was a big man — Hungarian by ancestry, Belter by birth, with arms like
bridge cables and a face that looked like it had been assembled from
spare parts. He was calibrating the Number Two grapple arm, a massive
hydraulic appendage that could grip a school bus and peel it like a
banana.

"Heard the update," Pete said without looking up. "More movers."

"Three more."

"Makes twenty-six total. Out of two hundred seventeen." Pete paused in
his calibration. "That's twelve percent. Twelve percent of a debris
field deciding to rearrange itself is not a nominal event, boss."

"I'm aware."

"You want to know what I think?"

"Not especially."

"I think something's out there juicing them. A signal. Some kind of
activation command. Probably military — half this junk is old DoD
hardware with God-knows-what still loaded in the firmware."

It was a reasonable theory. Dunbar had considered it himself. Old
military satellites carried all kinds of dormant systems — maneuvering
capabilities, communication suites, even weapons platforms, depending
on the era and the nation of origin. A rogue signal hitting the right
frequency could theoretically wake them up.

But that didn't explain the pattern.

"Just get the grapple arms ready," Dunbar said. "We'll start with the
inert ones. Tag and bag, standard procedure."

"And the ones that are moving?"

"We watch them. From a distance. Until we know what's going on."

Pete grinned. It was not a reassuring grin. "Sure, boss. From a
distance. That always works out great."

                               II.

They spent the first six hours on routine salvage. Rita maneuvered the
tug through the outer perimeter of the debris field while Pete and
Dunbar, in EVA suits, went out on tethers to tag the dead satellites
with transponder beacons. It was tedious, methodical work — the salvage
equivalent of counting inventory in a warehouse, except the warehouse
was spinning at two kilometers per second and any mistake could put a
fist-sized hole through your suit.

Dunbar tagged fourteen units in the first pass. Old Lockheed weather
birds, mostly, their instrument packages corroded and their solar
arrays curled like dead leaves. Each one got a magnetic transponder
slapped on its hull, linking it to the Bucket List's tracking system
for later retrieval. Standard procedure. Bread and butter.

It was on the fifteenth tag that things changed.

The satellite was a ComStar relay station, vintage 2019 — a boxy unit
about the size of a delivery van, with a large parabolic dish mounted
on a swivel arm. According to the ISC catalog, it had been
decommissioned in 2031 and had been tumbling dead in Sigma for
twenty-five years. Its batteries were long since depleted. Its solar
panels were shattered. There was no power source.

But when Dunbar pulled himself along its hull to plant the transponder,
the dish moved.

It happened slowly — a grinding, mechanical rotation that he felt
through his gloves more than he heard. The parabolic dish swiveled on
its corroded mount, fighting years of seized bearings and accumulated
micro-damage, and turned until it was pointed directly at him.

Dunbar froze. His heart slammed against his ribs like a prisoner
beating on a cell door.

"Leo," he said, and his voice was very steady, which surprised him.
"I need a power reading on the ComStar unit I'm currently attached to.
Catalog number Sigma-1-7-7."

A pause. Then Leo's voice, carefully neutral: "Sigma-177 is showing a
power signature. Low-level, but present. Source is... I'm not sure.
There's no active power system on that unit according to the catalog."

"The dish just moved, Leo. It pointed at me."

Another pause. Longer this time. "Copy that. I'm seeing the
repositioning on telemetry. Dunbar — the dish isn't pointed at you,
exactly. It's pointed at... let me run the geometry."

"Run it fast."

"It's pointed at Earth. You're just in the line of sight."

Dunbar looked at the dish. The dish, if a parabolic antenna could be
said to look at anything, looked back. Behind it, faint and blue and
impossibly distant, Earth hung in the void like a marble in a darkened
room.

He planted the transponder and got out of there.

                               * * *

Back on the tug, they gathered in the analysis lab while Sana ran the
data. Sana Osei was a small, precise woman from Accra who had three
PhDs and the demeanor of a librarian who suspected you of overdue books.
She did not speculate. She did not guess. She looked at data, and she
told you what the data said, and if you didn't like what the data said,
that was your problem.

"Twenty-six satellites are showing low-level power signatures," she
said, pointing to the holographic display. The debris field floated in
miniature above the lab table, with the active units highlighted in
amber. "All twenty-six have repositioned their primary antenna or solar
arrays to a common orientation. All twenty-six are pointed at Earth."

"Power source?" Dunbar asked.

"Unknown. The levels are consistent with residual solar charging, but
several of these units have non-functional solar arrays. They shouldn't
have any power at all."

"So where's it coming from?"

Sana gave him a look that said: I just told you it was unknown. What
part of unknown did you find ambiguous?

"There's something else," Leo said. He was at the secondary display,
manipulating a three-dimensional model of the debris field. "I've been
running the positional data through a pattern-recognition algorithm.
The active satellites aren't just pointed at Earth. They're arranged
in a specific configuration. If you look at the field from a
geocentric perspective — from the surface of Earth, looking up —
the active units form a pattern."

He rotated the display. The amber dots shifted, flattened into a
two-dimensional projection as seen from below.

The room went quiet.

The dots spelled a word. A name, actually. Six letters, unmistakable
against the background scatter of the inert satellites:

D-U-N-B-A-R

Pete Kovacs broke the silence. "Well," he said. "That's not ideal."

                               III.

Dunbar stood in his cabin for a long time after the others had gone to
their stations. The cabin was small — a bunk, a locker, a fold-down
desk bolted to the bulkhead. There was a photograph taped to the wall
above the desk: his daughter, Ellie, age seven, in a yellow raincoat,
laughing at something outside the frame. She was twelve now. He saw her
every other Christmas, when the salvage schedule and the orbital
mechanics aligned, which was the same thing.

DUNBAR.

Twenty-six dead satellites, arranged in the shape of his name.

He turned the facts over in his mind the way he turned a damaged
component in his hands during inspection — slowly, systematically,
looking for the flaw. There had to be an explanation. A signal, as Pete
suggested. A hack. Some teenager on Earth with too much time and a
talent for penetrating obsolete military firmware. A prank. An
elaborate, expensive, technically brilliant prank.

The alternative was that dead machines, without power, without
programming, without any conceivable motive or mechanism, had
rearranged themselves in the vacuum of space to spell his name.

Which was not an alternative he was prepared to consider.

He keyed the intercom. "Rita, get me a tightbeam to ISC headquarters
on Ceres. Priority channel."

"Already on it, boss. They're going to want to know about the
pattern."

"They're going to want to know a lot of things. So do I."

                               * * *

The ISC response came four hours later, and it was not helpful.

The transmission was from a Deputy Director named Calloway, a man
Dunbar had met once at a procurement conference and remembered as
someone who wore his authority like a rental tuxedo — technically
correct, but fitting badly. Calloway confirmed that ISC had received
the shipping crews' reports about satellite reactivation in Sigma but
had categorized them as sensor artifacts. The notion that the
satellites had formed a pattern had not been reported previously.

"It's possible," Calloway said, his face a pixelated mask on the comm
screen, "that the pattern is pareidolia. The human tendency to see
meaningful shapes in random configurations. We see faces in clouds,
Mr. Dunbar. Constellations in stars. The brain is a pattern-seeking
organ."

"I ran it through a pattern-recognition algorithm," Leo said from off-
screen. "The probability of twenty-six objects randomly arranging
themselves into a six-letter English name is approximately one in ten
to the forty-third power."

A long pause from Calloway.

"Continue your survey," he said finally. "Tag the inert units for
retrieval. Do not approach or attempt to interface with the active
units. We'll send a technical team from Ceres. ETA approximately eight
days."

The transmission ended. Dunbar stared at the blank screen.

"Eight days," Rita said.

"Eight days."

"A lot can happen in eight days."

"Thank you, Rita. That's very comforting."

She shrugged. "I'm a pilot, not a chaplain."

                               IV.

In the thirty-six hours that followed, three things happened.

First: four more satellites activated. Their dishes and arrays swiveled
to join the others, adding definition to the letters of Dunbar's name.
The D now had a serif. The U had deepened. Thirty units, out of two
hundred seventeen, were now part of the pattern.

Second: Leo detected a signal. It was buried deep in the background
noise of the debris field — a low-frequency electromagnetic pulse that
repeated at intervals of exactly 7.3 seconds. It was not coming from
any of the satellites. It was coming from the center of the debris
field, from a point in space where, according to the ISC catalog, there
was nothing at all.

Third: Sana found the connection.

She was in the lab, cross-referencing the catalog entries for the thirty
active satellites, when she noticed something that made her call Dunbar
down from the bridge at two in the morning.

"Every active satellite," she said, "was manufactured or launched by a
company or agency that employed, at some point, a person named Dunbar."

Dunbar felt something cold move through his chest. "What?"

"I've been going through the corporate histories. Sigma-177, the
ComStar relay — ComStar's chief engineer in 2018 was Martin Dunbar, no
known relation to you. Sigma-044, the old NOAA weather bird — the
NOAA facility that processed its data was the Dunbar Weather Station in
Dunbar, West Virginia. Sigma-091, the ESA survey platform — its
principal investigator was Dr. Fiona Dunbar of the University of
Edinburgh."

"You're saying these satellites activated because they have a connection
to the name Dunbar?"

"I'm saying there is a correlation. I am not saying there is a causal
mechanism. Those are different things."

"Sana —"

"The signal, though." She pulled up Leo's data. "The 7.3-second pulse
from the center of the field. I ran a frequency analysis. It's not
random. It's modulated. There's information in it."

"What kind of information?"

"Coordinates. Very precise coordinates. Latitude and longitude on
Earth's surface." She paused, and Dunbar saw something in her face
that he had never seen before: Sana Osei, who did not speculate, who
did not guess, who dealt only in data, was frightened. "The coordinates
correspond to a location in the suburbs of Chicago. Specifically, to
the house where you were born."

                               * * *

Dunbar didn't sleep that night. He sat in the observation blister at
the top of the tug and watched the dead satellites turn. Thirty of
them now, their dishes all pointed at Earth, at him, spelling his name
in the sky for anyone who cared to look.

He thought about his father. James Dunbar, electrician, who had wired
half the houses in their neighborhood and who had died of a stroke at
sixty-two while replacing a circuit breaker in the basement. He thought
about the house on Kedzie Avenue, the sagging porch, the elm tree in
the front yard that the city had cut down because of Dutch elm disease.
He thought about Ellie, twelve years old and growing up without him
because salvage masters didn't keep regular hours and orbital mechanics
didn't care about custody agreements.

DUNBAR.

His name, spelled in dead machines.

Why?

He pressed his forehead against the cold viewport glass and watched the
satellites flash. They were almost beautiful, in a terrible way — a
constellation designed by something that understood what names were,
what names meant, what a name could do to the person who carried it.

"Boss?"

It was Leo, on the intercom. His voice was wrong. Dunbar recognized the
tone: the tone of a man who has seen something on his instruments that
he needs to tell someone about but would very much prefer not to.

"Go ahead, Leo."

"The pattern is changing. The active satellites are repositioning.
They're... they're spelling something else now."

Dunbar closed his eyes. "What are they spelling?"

"DUNBAR COME."

                               V.

The argument lasted two hours.

Rita said no. Pete said no. Sana said no, with data to support her
position. Leo said he didn't have an opinion but his data suggested
that whatever was at the center of the debris field was actively
emitting the 7.3-second pulse and appeared to be directing the movement
of the active satellites, which meant it possessed some form of
operational intelligence, which meant that going to look at it was, in
his professional assessment, inadvisable.

Dunbar listened to all of them. He agreed with all of them. And then
he told Rita to plot a course to the center of the debris field.

"Mack." Rita used his first name, which she did approximately once per
year and only when she believed he was about to do something
catastrophically stupid. "We don't know what's in there."

"No, we don't. That's why I'm going to go look."

"You could wait for the ISC team."

"Eight days, Rita. You said it yourself — a lot can happen in eight
days. It's already changed the message once. What does it spell next?
My social security number? Ellie's name?" He shook his head. "Whatever
this is, it wants me specifically. It used my name. It knows where I
was born. I'm going."

"I should point out," Sana said, "that an entity which knows your name
and birthplace and can control two hundred dead satellites from the
center of a debris field is not an entity whose invitation one should
accept."

"Noted."

"I should further point out that in approximately ninety-four percent
of horror fiction and sixty-seven percent of real-world disaster
scenarios, the decision to investigate the unknown signal is the
decision that precipitates the catastrophe."

"Also noted."

"I calculated those percentages, by the way. They're not hyperbole."

"I believe you, Sana. Plot the course, Rita."

Rita plotted the course.

                               * * *

They went in slow. Rita threaded the Bucket List through the outer
shell of the debris field at walking speed, her hands steady on the
controls, her jaw set in the particular way that meant she was angry
but had decided to express it through superior piloting rather than
words. The dead satellites drifted past the viewport like gravestones
in a flooded cemetery — dark, tilted, catching the distant sun in
irregular flashes.

The active ones were different. As the tug passed them, their dishes
tracked the ship's movement. Thirty mechanical heads turning in unison,
following the Bucket List the way sunflowers follow the sun.

"That's deeply unsettling," Pete said from the cargo bay. He was
suited up, strapped into the Number One grapple station, ready to grab
anything that got too close. "Just for the record."

Leo guided them in. The 7.3-second pulse grew stronger as they
approached the center of the field, the signal sharp and clear on his
instruments. "Source is approximately three hundred meters ahead.
Bearing zero-zero-four relative. I'm getting a solid return now — there
is an object at the center. It's... big."

"How big?"

"Bigger than us. Stand by, I'm refining the scan." A pause. Then,
quietly: "Boss, it's a satellite. But it's not in the ISC catalog.
It's not in any catalog I can access. And it's old. The metallurgical
signature suggests mid-twentieth century construction."

"Mid-twentieth century? That's a hundred years. Nothing from that era
should still be —"

"I know."

They came around the bulk of a dead Russian communications platform
and saw it.

It hung in the center of the debris field like a spider in its web. It
was large — fifty meters across, roughly cylindrical, with four
enormous dish antennas arranged in a cruciform pattern and a central
core that bristled with instrument packages, solar arrays, and
structures that Dunbar could not identify. It was black — not painted
black, but black the way old iron is black, the way things become black
when they have absorbed every photon that has struck them for a hundred
years and reflected nothing.

It was broadcasting.

"The pulse is coming from that," Leo confirmed. "It's also emitting on
about thirty other frequencies that I'm just now picking up. It's been
talking this whole time. We just couldn't hear it from outside the
field."

"What's it saying?"

"On the primary frequency — the 7.3-second pulse — the same
coordinates. Your house. On the secondary frequencies..." Leo paused.
"Names. It's broadcasting names. Hundreds of them. Maybe thousands."

"Names?"

"Human names. Some I recognize — historical figures, scientists,
astronauts. Most I don't. They're just... names. Lists and lists of
names. And there are gaps, Dunbar. Spaces in the list. Like entries
that have been erased."

Sana came on the intercom. "I'm analyzing the hull composition from
Leo's metallurgical scan. The alloy is consistent with 1950s-era
American aerospace manufacturing. This satellite was built sometime
between 1955 and 1960. It was never cataloged by any space agency."

"A secret launch?"

"Or an unrecorded one. There were several in that era. Military,
mostly. Some were never acknowledged."

Dunbar stared at the thing through the viewport. It hung there,
perfectly still amid the tumbling dead machines around it, its four
great dishes pointed outward in four directions like a compass, and
every surface of it was covered in markings. Not paint. Not insignia.
Something that had been cut into the metal — precise, regular, covering
every centimeter of the hull like text on a page.

"I'm going out there," Dunbar said.

"Mack —" Rita started.

"I'm going out there. Pete, you're on the grapple. If anything
moves — anything at all — you grab me and pull me back."

"Copy that, boss."

He suited up alone in the airlock. The EVA suit was a standard
Kessler-class rig — bulky, reliable, ugly as sin. He checked the
seals, checked the oxygen, checked the tether connection. Then he
opened the outer door and stepped into the dark.

                               VI.

The silence was absolute.

Dunbar drifted across the gap between the tug and the black satellite
on a jet of compressed nitrogen, his tether unspooling behind him like
a silver thread. The debris field turned slowly around him. The active
satellites — all thirty of them — had repositioned again. He couldn't
read the new message from this close. He didn't want to.

The surface of the black satellite resolved as he approached. The
markings he'd seen through the viewport were indeed cut into the
metal — engraved, with a precision that suggested machine tooling. They
were names. Thousands and thousands of names, covering every surface of
the hull in neat rows, like the names on a war memorial.

He reached the hull and caught a handhold. The metal was cold, even
through his gloves. He pulled himself along the surface, reading the
names as they passed under his faceplate.

HAROLD MUELLER. CONSTANCE PARK. DAVID IBANEZ. JUNE WEATHERBY. ROBERT
CHEN. MARGARET OLMSTEAD. WILLIAM FRYE. ANNA KOWALSKI.

Names. Just names. No dates, no titles, no other information. Row after
row after row, covering the entire surface of the satellite in an
unbroken scroll of human identity.

"Sana, are you getting this on my helmet cam?"

"Yes. I'm running the names through every database I can access.
Preliminary results are... confusing. Some match historical records.
Some match living people. Some don't match anything."

"What about the ones that match living people?"

A pause. "Cross-referencing now. Stand by."

Dunbar continued along the hull. The names went on and on. He passed a
section where several names had been struck through — not erased but
crossed out with a single line, the way you'd cross a name off a list.
The struck-through names were darker than the others, the engraving
deeper, as if done with more force.

JAMES DUNBAR.

He stopped. His father's name. Crossed out.

His breathing was very loud in his helmet. He could hear his heart, his
blood, the whir of the suit's life-support fan. He pulled himself
further along the hull, scanning the names, reading them one by one,
the cold of the metal seeping through his gloves and into his bones.

ELEANOR DUNBAR.

His mother. Not crossed out.

ELLEN DUNBAR.

His ex-wife. Not crossed out.

ELLIE DUNBAR.

His daughter. Not crossed out.

MACK DUNBAR.

His name. Not crossed out. But different from the others. His name was
not merely engraved — it was surrounded by a series of concentric
circles, like a target. Like a destination on a map. Like something
that had been found after a long search.

"Boss." Leo's voice, tight with urgency. "The active satellites are
repositioning again. All thirty of them. They're moving into a new
configuration."

"What do they spell?"

"DUNBAR FOUND."

The black satellite hummed. Dunbar felt it through his gloves — a
vibration that traveled up his arms and into his chest, a deep,
subsonic pulse that was almost a heartbeat. The four great dishes began
to move, rotating on their mounts with the grinding inevitability of
continental drift. All four of them turned inward. All four of them
pointed at him.

"I'm getting a massive power spike from the central object," Leo said,
his voice cracking. "It's charging something. The secondary frequencies
are going crazy — the name broadcasts are accelerating, they're
cycling through the list faster and faster —"

"Pete, pull me back."

"Grapple's locked. Reeling now."

The tether went taut. Dunbar felt the jerk as the grapple arm hauled
him away from the hull. The black satellite receded, its four dishes
still pointed at the spot where he had been, and as the distance grew,
he could see the active satellites rearranging themselves one final
time, spelling their last message across the sky.

DUNBAR MARKED.

He hit the airlock at speed, Pete's grapple arm depositing him on the
deck with more enthusiasm than finesse. The outer door slammed shut.
Rita had the engines firing before the lock had finished cycling.

"Go," Dunbar said. "Go now."

Rita went.

                               VII.

They cleared the debris field in seven minutes. Rita flew the way she
flew when she was scared, which was the same way she flew when she
wasn't — clean, precise, without wasted motion — except faster. The
Bucket List's engines screamed at the redline, and the dead satellites
of Graveyard Sigma shrank behind them until the whole field was just
a cluster of faint lights against the black.

Dunbar was in the lab with Sana. His hands were shaking. He put them
flat on the table and pressed down until they stopped.

"The names on the hull," he said. "The ones that were crossed out.
What did you find?"

Sana's face was carefully neutral. The face of a woman presenting data
she did not want to present.

"I was able to identify three hundred and seventeen names from your
helmet camera footage before you were pulled away. Of those, I was
able to cross-reference two hundred and nine against public records."
She paused. "Every name that was crossed out belongs to a deceased
person. Every name that was not crossed out belongs to someone who is
currently alive."

The room was very quiet.

"It's a list," Dunbar said.

"Yes."

"A list of everyone who will ever live. Or has ever lived. Or — "

"I don't know what it is, Mack. I can tell you what the data shows.
The data shows a correlation between the crossed-out names and
confirmed deaths. The correlation is one hundred percent. I checked
it four times."

"And my father's name was crossed out."

"Yes."

"And my daughter's name was not."

"No. Nor yours." She hesitated, which Sana never did. "But yours was
marked. Circled. Targeted. Whatever you want to call it."

"What does that mean?"

"I don't know. And I will not speculate."

Dunbar nodded. He stood up from the table. He walked to the viewport
and looked out at the receding debris field. The thirty active
satellites were still visible — faint amber points forming letters
that he could no longer read at this distance. But he knew what they
said. DUNBAR MARKED.

"Leo," he said over the intercom. "The signal. The 7.3-second pulse.
Is it still broadcasting?"

"Yes, boss. Same coordinates. Your childhood home."

"And the names? The list?"

"Still cycling. Faster than before. The list is enormous, Dunbar.
I've been running a count. Based on the cycling speed and the total
broadcast time, there are approximately eight billion names on that
list."

Eight billion. The approximate population of Earth.

"Boss?" Leo said. "There's one more thing. I wasn't going to mention
it because I'm not sure of the data, but... the names that are being
broadcast? They're not static. The list is changing. Names are being
struck off in real time. And new names — shorter entries, different
formatting — are being added."

"People dying," Dunbar said. "And people being born."

"That would be consistent with the data, yes."

Dunbar pressed his forehead against the viewport glass. It was cold.
Everything was cold. The stars were cold. The void was cold. And
somewhere behind him, in the center of a graveyard of dead machines,
a satellite that should not exist maintained a list of every human
being alive, and it had marked his name.

"Rita," he said.

"Yeah, boss."

"When we get to Ceres, I'm taking leave. I'm going to Earth. I'm
going to Chicago."

"To the house?"

"To see Ellie. I need to see Ellie."

Rita was quiet for a moment. Then: "I'll plot the fastest route."

                               * * *

They docked at Ceres Station nine days later. The ISC technical team
passed them on the way out, a crew of twelve in a military-spec survey
vessel, headed for Graveyard Sigma with enough scanning equipment to
map the surface of a planet. Dunbar briefed them over a scratchy radio
connection. He told them about the black satellite, the names, the
pulse. He told them everything.

He did not tell them about the last thing.

The last thing had happened on the sixth day of the return trip, at
0347 hours, when Dunbar was alone in the observation blister. He had
been looking at the stars — or looking at nothing, really, just
sitting in the dark with his thoughts — when the communication console
beside him had crackled to life. Not the ship's comm system. The
console had been powered down. But it crackled, and hissed, and spoke.

It spoke in a voice that was not a voice — a mechanical approximation,
assembled from fragments of old broadcasts and transmissions, patched
together like a ransom note made from magazine clippings. And what it
said was:

"Dunbar. You are on the list. You were always on the list. Everyone
is on the list. The list is the purpose. The list is the function.
We count you. We have always counted you. When the count reaches
zero, the function is complete."

The console went dead.

Dunbar sat in the dark for a long time, thinking about a satellite that
someone had built in the 1950s, before Sputnik, before anything, and
sent into the sky to count. To count every human being. To keep track.
To watch the numbers climb and, eventually, to watch them fall.

He thought about what happened when the count reached zero.

He thought about Ellie.

He booked passage to Earth that afternoon, on the first available
transport, and he did not look at the sky again until he was on the
ground, in Chicago, standing on the porch of a house on Kedzie Avenue
that no longer belonged to his family, with his daughter in his arms
and the autumn leaves falling around them like the pages of a book
that someone, somewhere, was slowly closing.

He never went back to space.

The ISC team arrived at Graveyard Sigma four days later and found
the debris field empty. Every satellite — all two hundred and
seventeen, plus the black one at the center — was gone. The
coordinates were correct. The field was mapped and verified. But
there was nothing there.

Just empty space, and silence, and the 7.3-second pulse, which
continued to broadcast from a source that no instrument could locate,
cycling through its list of names, crossing them off one by one by
one, like a clock counting down to an hour that no one alive would
want to see.

================================================================================

                      MASQUE OF THE RED SHIFT

                        by Oscar Lennox

================================================================================

                             OVERTURE

                 (In Which the Nature of the Event
                     Is Established, and the
                  Reader Is Warned That What Follows
                 May Not Proceed in the Expected Order)

The universe was dying, of course. It had been dying for quite some
time — fourteen billion years, give or take, depending on which
cosmologist you consulted and which set of assumptions about dark
energy you were willing to entertain. But the dying had, until
recently, been the polite, gradual sort: the kind you could
comfortably ignore, the way one ignores the eventual heat death of the
sun while planning a Tuesday afternoon picnic. Theoretical. Remote.
Someone else's problem.

It was no longer someone else's problem.

The expansion of the universe had accelerated — not in the gentle,
barely-measurable way that Hubble's observations had first suggested,
but catastrophically, visibly, in a manner that even the most
determinedly optimistic cosmologist could not dismiss as within normal
parameters. The sky was emptying. Galaxies that had been visible for
millennia were receding past the cosmic event horizon, their light
stretching into the infrared, the microwave, and then into nothing at
all. Each night, the sky held fewer stars. Each generation grew up
under a darker canopy than the one before.

This had been happening, in the accelerated timeframe that concerns us,
for approximately six hundred years. In that time, the visible universe
had contracted from its once-magnificent billions of galaxies to a
local neighborhood of thirty-seven. Then seventeen. Then nine. Then
three.

Now there was one.

The Remnant — the last galaxy, the final luminous structure in an
observable universe that had shrunk to a sphere approximately two
million light-years in diameter and was shrinking still — contained
within its spiral arms approximately four hundred billion stars, and
orbiting those stars, on planets and stations and habitats of every
conceivable design, lived the last civilization. Seventeen trillion
souls, give or take, spread across a galaxy that was, for all
practical purposes, the entire cosmos.

They had a name for what was happening. They called it the Recession.
Not the economic kind, though there was that too. The cosmological
kind. The universe was receding from them — or they from it — and
there was nothing to be done about it. The physics was clear. The
mathematics was settled. The Recession was not a disease to be cured
or an enemy to be fought. It was the nature of things. The universe
was expanding, and the expansion was accelerating, and eventually the
last galaxy would itself be pulled apart, star from star, planet from
planet, atom from atom, until there was nothing left but radiation
cooling toward absolute zero in an emptiness so vast that the word
"vast" lost all meaning.

This would take time, of course. Billions of years, probably. Trillions,
possibly. But the visible symptoms were already present: the dark sky,
the vanished galaxies, the sense — felt by even the most stolid and
unimaginative citizens of the Remnant — that the walls of reality were
closing in.

It was against this backdrop that Castellan Orso Venn, Lord of the
Processional Reach, Governor of the Ninety Suns, and, by general
consensus, the most powerful individual in what remained of organized
civilization, announced that he would host a masquerade.

                               I.

               (In Which the Invitations Are Delivered
                and Their Nature Is Considered)

The invitations arrived by courier drone — small, elegant machines
that materialized from fold-space at each recipient's doorstep,
delivered their payload, and dissolved into component atoms exactly
thirty seconds later. This was, by the standards of Castellan Venn's
household, a restrained display. The Castellan was known for excess.
His palace occupied an entire moon. His wardrobe was cataloged in a
database that required its own server farm. His dinner parties had, on
more than one occasion, required the temporary rerouting of interstellar
shipping lanes.

The invitation itself was a small, heavy card, printed on paper — actual
cellulose paper, in an age when the last tree had been extinct for four
centuries — in ink that shimmered between black and ultraviolet depending
on the angle of observation. The text read:

    CASTELLAN ORSO VENN
    requests the honor of your presence
    at
    A MASQUE OF THE RED SHIFT
    to be held at the Palace of the Processional Reach
    on the occasion of the Last Visible Recession
    (the departure of NGC 1277 from the observable horizon)

    DRESS: Each guest shall attend disguised as an extinct galaxy.
    The host shall attend disguised as the universe itself.

    AT MIDNIGHT, THE HOST WILL REMOVE HIS MASK.
    ALL GUESTS ARE ADVISED TO CONSIDER WHETHER
    THEY WISH TO SEE WHAT IS BENEATH.

    RSVP is not required. Your attendance has already been determined.

The last line was the one that generated the most discussion.

"Your attendance has already been determined" could be interpreted in
several ways, depending on one's philosophical orientation and one's
familiarity with Castellan Venn's reputation. It could be a joke — the
Castellan was known for his baroque sense of humor. It could be a
threat — the Castellan was also known for his intolerance of refusal.
Or it could be a statement of metaphysical conviction — a reference to
the deterministic interpretation of physics that the Castellan, a
sometime philosopher of some reputation, was known to favor.

The invitations went to seven hundred guests. All seven hundred
accepted. Whether this validated the Castellan's determinism or merely
his social power was a question that several of the guests debated
during the weeks of preparation, as they selected their costumes and
contemplated what it meant to disguise oneself as something that no
longer existed.

                               II.

                (In Which the Guests Are Introduced,
              and Their Costumes Are Described in Some
                Detail, Because the Costumes Matter)

They came from across the Remnant, arriving at the Palace of the
Processional Reach by fold-ship, by light-sail, by the ancient and
unreliable matter-transmission systems that the Castellan maintained
for aesthetic rather than practical reasons (he enjoyed the slight
randomization of molecular structure that the old transmitters produced,
claiming it gave his guests "an interesting texture").

The palace itself deserves description, though a complete description
would require more pages than this account can spare. Suffice it to say
that it occupied the entirety of Venn's Moon — a small, airless body
that had been hollowed out, filled with atmosphere, and reconstructed
from the inside as a single continuous interior space, a sphere five
hundred kilometers in diameter whose inner surface was covered in
gardens, ballrooms, galleries, libraries, and architectural follies
of every period and style. Gravity was maintained by rotation. The
sky — the interior sky, looking up from the inner surface toward the
center of the sphere — was occupied by a small artificial sun that
could be dimmed, brightened, or replaced with a convincing simulation
of any sky from any world in the historical record.

For the masquerade, the Castellan had set the sky to show the universe
as it had been: the deep field, the billions of galaxies, the ancient
and abundant cosmos that no living being had ever seen. It was
projected above the ballroom in exquisite detail, and several guests
wept upon seeing it, though whether from beauty or grief was difficult
to determine.

The guests.

They entered through seven gates — one for each of the spectral
classes, a conceit that pleased the Castellan's sense of order — and
they were magnificent. Seven hundred beings in costumes that
represented seven hundred dead galaxies, each one an act of mourning
disguised as an act of art.

The Andromeda Contingent arrived first: fourteen guests in shimmering
blue-white, their costumes constructed from woven light-thread that
approximated the spiral structure of the galaxy that had been the
Remnant's nearest neighbor before the Recession claimed it. Their
leader, the Aesthete of Corridor Nine, wore Andromeda's central
black hole as a pendant — a tiny gravitational anomaly suspended in a
magnetic bottle, pulling at the fabric of her gown in ways that were
both beautiful and slightly nauseating.

The Magellanic Delegation was smaller — six guests representing the
two dwarf galaxies that had once orbited the Remnant like attendant
moons. Their costumes were delicate, translucent, suggesting the
irregular shapes of galaxies that had never achieved the confident
spirals of their larger kin. One guest wore the Large Magellanic Cloud
as a veil; another wore the Small as a pair of gloves. They moved
through the crowd with a diffidence that some found affecting and
others found tiresome.

The Virgo Cluster Society, by contrast, arrived in force: forty guests
representing the great galactic cluster that had dominated the local
supercluster for billions of years before the Recession scattered it
like seeds in a wind. Their costumes were the most elaborate at the
masquerade — layered, complex, architectural, each one a miniature
recreation of a specific galaxy within the cluster, complete with
simulated rotation and the faint, haunting glow of stellar populations
that had been red-shifted into extinction. The Society's chairman, Lord
Pelion of the Tertiary Arm, wore the entire Virgo Cluster as a cape:
a sweeping garment of woven gravitational lensing that bent the light
around him, making him appear to exist in multiple locations
simultaneously.

And there were others — the Triangulum Pair, dressed in matching
spirals; the Centaurus Mourners, in black; the Sculptor Wall
Collective, whose costume was a single interconnected structure worn
by all twelve members, so that they moved through the ballroom as a
living filament of the cosmic web. Each costume was a memory. Each
guest was a ghost wearing the skin of something that the universe had
taken away.

The ballroom was enormous — a vault two kilometers across, its floor
polished to mirror smoothness, its walls rising to an arched ceiling
that merged seamlessly with the projected sky. The Castellan's
household orchestra played from a floating platform at the center of
the space, performing compositions written for instruments that no
longer existed, using tonal scales derived from the harmonic resonances
of collapsed stars. The music was strange and beautiful and sad, and
it filled the vast room like fog filling a valley.

Drinks were served by automated attendants in the shapes of extinct
celestial objects: comets, asteroids, rogue planets. The food was
equally thematic — dishes named for cosmological phenomena, prepared
by the Castellan's legendary kitchen staff, who had been given the
brief to "make the guests taste the universe." The result was a menu
that included Hawking Reduction (a broth of such concentrated flavor
that a single sip contained, in caloric terms, the equivalent of a
small star), Cosmic Microwave Background Noise (a crackling bread that
tasted different to each person who ate it, depending on their genetic
heritage), and Red Shift Sorbet (a frozen dessert that changed color
as it dissolved on the tongue, moving through the visible spectrum from
blue to red before disappearing entirely).

The guests ate. The guests drank. The guests danced.

And the sky above them darkened by one more star.

                               III.

              (In Which Certain Conversations Take Place,
                 and Their Significance Is Debated)

Among the seven hundred guests, several conversations deserve
particular attention, as they illuminate the themes that the Castellan
intended his masquerade to explore — or, more precisely, the themes
that the masquerade explored regardless of the Castellan's intentions,
because a sufficiently ambitious metaphor will always exceed its
author's control.

Conversation the First: The Cosmologist and the Poet.

Dr. Vera Ilyich, disguised as the Sombrero Galaxy (she wore the
distinctive dust lane as a sash across her chest, and her wide-brimmed
hat contained a working model of the galaxy's supermassive central
bulge), found herself standing beside Alessio Dain, disguised as IC
1101 — the largest galaxy ever observed, long since swallowed by the
Recession. Dain's costume was simply a very large coat, which he wore
with the air of a man who has realized, too late, that his joke was
not as clever as he thought.

"The Recession is not a tragedy," Dr. Ilyich said, accepting a glass
of something that glowed faintly violet. "A tragedy requires a
protagonist with agency. The universe is not a protagonist. It has no
agency. It simply expands."

"Everything is a tragedy if you describe it in the right tone of
voice," Dain replied. He was a poet of considerable reputation, known
for verse cycles that reimagined cosmological events as personal
relationships. His most famous work, "Love Letter to a Barred Spiral,"
had been performed in every major cultural venue in the Remnant. "The
universe doesn't need agency to be tragic. It only needs an audience.
And we are the audience. We are the ones who notice that the lights
are going out."

"Noticing is not the same as mattering."

"Isn't it? If a galaxy disappears and no one is there to observe it,
has it disappeared at all?"

Dr. Ilyich frowned. "Yes. Obviously. The physics does not require an
observer."

"The physics doesn't. But the tragedy does." Dain smiled, adjusted his
enormous coat, and wandered away to refill his glass. Dr. Ilyich
watched him go and felt, for reasons she could not articulate, that
she had lost the argument.

Conversation the Second: The General and the Archivist.

Commander Wren Sable, disguised as the Cartwheel Galaxy (her costume
featured the distinctive ring structure created by a galactic collision,
rendered in bands of luminescent fabric that rippled outward from her
center with each step), stood near the orchestra platform in close
discussion with Keeper Lune of the Archival Reaches, disguised as
Hoag's Object (a perfect ring of stars with an empty center, the
costume achieving this effect through a clever arrangement of suspended
light-points around a void of absolute black).

"The Castellan's invitation was not a request," Commander Sable said.
"It was a summons. And the final line — 'your attendance has already
been determined' — is a statement of political philosophy, not
cosmology. Venn believes that free will is an illusion. That choice is
a comforting fiction we tell ourselves while the physics of the universe
determines our every action."

"And you disagree," said Keeper Lune. Her voice came from within the
void at the center of her costume, which gave it an unsettling
resonance.

"I disagree profoundly. Choice is the only meaningful human act in the
face of the Recession. The universe may be deterministic. The expansion
may be inevitable. But my decision to be here, to witness, to remember
— that is mine."

"Is it? You received the invitation. You came. Exactly as the
Castellan predicted."

"I came because I chose to come."

"How do you know?"

Commander Sable was silent for a long moment. The orchestra played
something in a minor key that seemed to bend the air.

"Because I considered not coming," she said at last. "And the act of
considering is the act of choosing."

"Or it is the act of a deterministic system simulating choice for its
own comfort," Keeper Lune said, not unkindly. "The Castellan would say
that your deliberation, your consideration, your ultimate decision to
attend were all inevitable from the moment of the Big Bang. That they
were encoded in the initial conditions. That the universe has been
writing the guest list since the beginning."

"The Castellan is a nihilist in a very expensive palace."

"Yes. But he may also be correct."

Conversation the Third: The Child and the Empty Sky.

This conversation was not between guests. It was between Pella, the
Castellan's twelve-year-old daughter (disguised, at her own insistence,
as the Milky Way — which is to say, disguised as home), and the sky
itself.

Pella had escaped the ballroom through a service corridor and climbed
to an observation deck on the upper surface of the moon, where the
projected sky gave way to the real one. She sat on the cold metal floor,
her elaborate costume bunched around her, and looked up.

The real sky was almost empty. The Remnant's own stars provided a dense,
bright band — the familiar arm of the galaxy, seen from within — but
beyond that, in every direction, there was almost nothing. A faint
smudge of light in the direction of what had been the Virgo Cluster: a
single dwarf galaxy, the last companion, already measurably redder than
it had been the year before, already receding, already dying in the
way that distance is a kind of death.

Otherwise: darkness. The profound, pressing, almost physical darkness
of a universe that had emptied itself of light.

"Where did they go?" Pella said, to no one.

The question was not rhetorical. It was the question that every child
in the Remnant asked at some point, and no adult could answer
satisfactorily. Where did the galaxies go? The honest answer — they
didn't go anywhere; the space between us expanded until their light
could no longer reach us — was technically accurate and emotionally
meaningless. The galaxies were still there. They were still burning.
They were still full of worlds and people and civilizations. But they
were beyond the horizon of the observable universe, and no signal, no
ship, no force in physics could ever reach them again. They were gone
the way the dead are gone: present in memory, absent in fact, existing
in a place that you could name but never visit.

Pella sat on the observation deck and looked at the empty sky and felt,
with the full, unfiltered intensity of a twelve-year-old's emotional
apparatus, the weight of everything that was missing.

Then she went back to the ballroom, because the music was still playing
and because her father had promised that at midnight, he would remove
his mask.

                               IV.

                 (In Which the Host Is Described,
               and His Costume Is Revealed, and the
              Reader May Begin to Suspect What Lies Beneath)

Castellan Orso Venn stood at the center of the ballroom, and he was
magnificent.

His costume — the universe itself — was the work of the Remnant's
finest cosmological engineers, a team of forty who had labored for six
months to construct a garment that could contain, in miniature, the
totality of everything. He wore the cosmos on his body: a suit of
woven dark energy that rippled and shifted with every movement,
containing within its folds a holographic representation of the
universe at every stage of its history. Galaxies formed and dissolved
across his shoulders. Stars ignited along his arms and died at his
fingertips. The cosmic microwave background shimmered across his chest
in the faint, ancient glow of the universe's first light.

His mask was the most remarkable element. It was a face — but not his
face. It was the face of the universe as a geometer might draw it: a
perfect sphere, featureless and luminous, containing within its surface
a map of everything that existed. When you looked at the mask, you saw
your own galaxy. You saw your own star. If you looked long enough, the
Castellan's engineers promised, you would see your own world, your own
city, your own face reflected back at you from within the smooth,
curved surface of totality.

The guests circled him. The orchestra played. The sky darkened. The
clock — an ancient mechanical device that the Castellan had commissioned
for the occasion, powered by a wound spring rather than any quantum
mechanism, because he wanted the passage of time to be physical,
audible, felt — ticked toward midnight.

And the Castellan danced.

He danced with the Andromeda Contingent, spinning the Aesthete of
Corridor Nine through a waltz that left her gasping and disoriented.
He danced with the Magellanic Delegation, moving with the small, quick
steps appropriate to a dwarf galaxy's modest gravity. He danced with
Lord Pelion of the Virgo Cluster Society, and their dance was a vast,
slow thing, two enormous gravitational bodies orbiting each other at
the center of the ballroom while the other guests watched and the
orchestra played something that sounded like the harmonic series of a
collapsing nebula.

He danced with everyone. He touched everyone. And every guest who
danced with the Castellan reported the same experience afterward: a
moment, during the dance, when the mask turned toward them and they
saw, in its luminous surface, not a reflection but a vision — their
own galaxy, their own star, their own world, burning in the vast
interior of the Castellan's costume, small and fragile and
unbearably beautiful against the infinite dark.

Several guests wept. Several others laughed. One — the poet Dain —
stopped dancing entirely, stood still in the middle of the ballroom
floor, and said, in a voice that carried across the enormous room:
"Oh. Oh, I see. It's not a costume at all, is it?"

The Castellan did not reply. He continued to dance.

The clock ticked.

                               V.

          (In Which Midnight Approaches, and the Nature
             of the Unmasking Is Contemplated)

At eleven-thirty, the orchestra stopped.

The silence was immediate and total — seven hundred guests, in seven
hundred costumes representing seven hundred dead galaxies, standing in
a ballroom two kilometers across beneath a sky that was losing its
stars, and not one of them making a sound.

The Castellan stepped onto the central platform, where the orchestra
had been. The musicians had vanished — dissolved, some whispered, into
the structure of the palace, becoming part of the architecture, their
music embedded in the walls. Whether this was true or merely the kind
of rumor that the Castellan's reputation generated was, like most
things about the Castellan, uncertain.

He stood on the platform, and his costume blazed. The universe on his
body pulsed with light — not the cold, distant light of stars but a
warm, near, intimate light that reached across the ballroom and touched
each guest like a hand on a cheek. His mask glowed with the faces of
everyone present, cycling through them one by one, seven hundred
reflections in the surface of the cosmos.

"You came as the dead," he said.

His voice was not amplified. It should not have been audible in a room
that size. But every guest heard it as clearly as if he were standing
beside them, whispering in their ear.

"You came disguised as the galaxies the universe has taken from us.
Andromeda. The Magellanic Clouds. Virgo. Triangulum. Centaurus. The
Sculptor Wall. Seven hundred galaxies, seven hundred guests, seven
hundred acts of remembrance for a cosmos that is shrinking around us
like a closing fist."

The projected sky above the ballroom flickered. One by one, the
simulated galaxies began to disappear, leaving behind empty patches
of absolute black. It was a reenactment of the Recession — compressed,
accelerated, the slow catastrophe of six hundred years played out in
the space of a speech.

"But I did not invite you here to mourn," the Castellan said. "Mourning
is for those who have lost something they might have kept. We have lost
nothing. The galaxies were never ours. The universe was never ours. We
are guests in a house that is being dismantled around us, and the
correct response to this is not grief but attention. Not despair but
witness."

The sky was nearly dark now. Only a handful of simulated galaxies
remained, flickering like candles in a draft.

"I promised you an unmasking. I promised to show you what lies beneath
the mask of the universe. Some of you, I know, expect a revelation.
Some expect a horror. Some expect nothing at all — the void behind
the veil, the empty set, the answer that is no answer."

He raised his hands to the edges of his mask. The room held its
breath. Seven hundred guests in seven hundred dead galaxies, watching
the universe prepare to reveal itself.

"The question you should be asking," the Castellan said, his fingers
resting on the mask's luminous surface, "is not what is beneath the
mask. The question is: what happens to the mask when it is removed?
What happens to the universe when the universe takes itself off?"

The clock struck twelve.

                               VI.

             (In Which the Mask Is Removed, and What
              Is Beneath Is Described, to the Extent
                 That Language Permits, Which Is
                   Not Very Far at All)

What happened next was described differently by every guest who
witnessed it, which is itself significant. An event that is perceived
identically by all observers is physics. An event that is perceived
differently by each observer is either art or madness, and the
Castellan, by all accounts, was intimate with both.

Some guests reported that when the Castellan removed his mask, there
was nothing beneath. Not a face. Not a void. Not darkness. Nothing.
An absence so complete that the mind could not process it as absence
but instead interpreted it as a kind of impossible presence — the
presence of that which is not there, the shape of a missing thing, a
hole in the air where a face should be but isn't, has never been,
will never be.

Other guests reported a face — but not the Castellan's face. A face
that was all faces: shifting, flickering, cycling through every
possible configuration of human features at a speed that made each
individual face visible for only a fraction of a second, so that the
overall impression was of a crowd, a civilization, a species, compressed
into a single pair of eyes, a single mouth, a single expression that
was simultaneously every expression that a human face could wear.

Still others reported that beneath the mask was another mask. And
beneath that mask, another. And another. Each one smaller, finer,
more detailed than the last, an infinite regression of masks descending
toward a center that could never be reached because there was always
another layer, always another surface, always another face to remove
before the truth — if there was a truth — could be seen.

Commander Sable reported that she saw the face of the universe: not a
metaphor but a literal face, made of dark matter and dark energy,
its features shaped by the large-scale structure of the cosmic web,
its expression one of vast, geological, incomprehensible sorrow.

Dr. Ilyich reported that she saw equations. The fundamental equations
of physics, written in light on the surface of whatever was beneath the
mask, and that the equations were wrong — not incorrect in their
mathematics but wrong in their implications, describing a universe
that should not exist, that was not possible, that violated its own
axioms by the simple act of being.

Keeper Lune reported that she saw nothing, and she meant this
literally: she saw the concept of nothing, the abstract idea of
nonexistence, made visible, made perceptible, made — impossibly —
present. She described it afterward as "looking at zero and
discovering that zero has a face."

The poet Dain reported that he saw a page. A blank page, with a
single word written on it. The word was "ENOUGH." He spent the rest
of his life trying to determine whether this was a command, a
description, or a question.

And Pella — the Castellan's daughter, the twelve-year-old in the
Milky Way costume — reported that she saw her father's face. Just
his face. No metaphysics, no cosmic horror, no layered masks or
impossible absences. Just a man, her father, looking tired and sad
and a little bit afraid, the way he looked on the nights when he
sat alone in his study and thought she couldn't see him through the
crack in the door.

She was the only guest who reported that what she saw made her feel
better rather than worse.

                               VII.

             (In Which the Consequences Are Enumerated,
              and the Reader Is Left to Determine
                  What, If Anything, Was Meant)

The masquerade ended at dawn — or what passed for dawn in the
artificial sky of Venn's Moon, the small sun brightening gradually
from black to amber to the pale gold of a morning that existed
nowhere in nature but only in the Castellan's aesthetic preferences.

The guests departed. The costumes were shed. Seven hundred dead
galaxies were folded, hung, packed into cases, returned to their
constituent materials. The ballroom was cleaned. The orchestra
platform was dismantled. The mechanical clock was stopped, its spring
unwound, its purpose complete.

And the sky — the real sky, visible from the observation decks on the
moon's outer surface — was darker by one more light.

NGC 1277. A compact elliptical galaxy in the Perseus Cluster — or
what had been the Perseus Cluster, before the Recession scattered it.
It had been the last galaxy visible to the naked eye beyond the
Remnant, a faint smudge of light in the direction of what the ancients
had called Perseus, the hero. During the masquerade, sometime between
the second dance and the removal of the mask, it had crossed the
cosmic event horizon. Its light had shifted past the visible spectrum,
past infrared, past microwave, into the radio frequencies and then
into nothing. It was gone.

The Remnant was alone.

The last galaxy in the observable universe, spinning in an empty
void that extended in every direction to a horizon beyond which
nothing would ever be seen again.

After the masquerade, several things happened that may or may not
have been consequences:

1. Commander Sable resigned her military commission and established
   the Archive of Recession — a project to record, in every available
   medium, the complete known history of every galaxy that had ever
   been observed. The Archive eventually grew to occupy an entire
   stellar system and employed over a million archivists, curators,
   and data engineers. It was, by any measure, the largest memorial
   ever constructed.

2. Dr. Ilyich published a paper demonstrating that the equations she
   had seen (or believed she had seen) beneath the Castellan's mask
   were, in fact, a valid solution to the unified field equations — a
   solution that described a universe in which the Recession was not
   inevitable but was instead the result of a choice. Whose choice,
   and how it might be reversed, her paper did not specify. The paper
   was widely discussed, fiercely debated, and never conclusively
   refuted.

3. The poet Dain wrote his final work: a single poem, one word long.
   The word was "ENOUGH." He then retired from public life and was
   never heard from again.

4. Keeper Lune returned to the Archival Reaches and began a project
   to catalog every instance of nothing in the known universe — every
   void, every gap, every absence, every space where something had
   been and was no longer. The catalog, when completed, was larger
   than the catalog of things that existed.

5. Pella grew up.

This last consequence is perhaps the most significant. Pella grew up
in a universe that was emptying, in a sky that was darkening, in a
civilization that was learning to live without the comfort of a cosmos.
She grew up knowing that beyond the Remnant there was nothing — not
the exciting nothing of unexplored space but the final nothing of
expanded emptiness, the nothing that was not waiting to be filled
but that was, itself, the filling, the expansion, the thing that the
universe was becoming.

And she grew up with the memory of her father's face beneath the mask:
tired, sad, afraid, human.

She became, in time, the Castellan of the Processional Reach herself.
She did not host a masquerade. She did not wear the universe as a
costume. She did not promise to reveal what lay beneath.

Instead, she built a window.

A window, on the highest point of Venn's Moon, oriented toward the
darkest part of the sky — the direction in which the most galaxies had
vanished, the direction of maximum loss. The window was large, ten
meters across, made of the clearest glass that the Remnant's
technology could produce. It looked out on nothing. Absolute, perfect,
inarguable nothing.

And beneath the window, on a plaque set into the wall, she placed
the following words:

    THIS IS WHAT THE UNIVERSE LOOKS LIKE
    WHEN IT TAKES OFF ITS MASK.

    WE ARE STILL HERE.

    WE ARE STILL LOOKING.

    THAT IS ENOUGH.

Whether "enough" was a command, a description, or a question — whether
Pella intended it as her father had intended it, or the poet had
intended it, or in some entirely new sense that was hers alone — is
a question that the reader must answer for themselves.

The Remnant endured. The sky continued to darken. The Recession
continued to accelerate. Stars that had seemed permanent began,
over the millennia that followed, to drift apart, the slow unwinding
of the galaxy itself — the final act of a universe that was determined,
it seemed, to be alone.

But the window remained. And people came to look through it. And what
they saw — or what they chose to see, or what the act of seeing
created — was not nothing.

It was the space where everything had been.

And the looking — the act of standing at the window and refusing to
turn away from the dark — was, perhaps, the universe's last and
most defiant act of self-knowledge. The mask had been removed. The
face beneath was emptiness. And the response of the last civilization
was not to scream, not to weep, not to avert their eyes, but to
look.

To look, and to say: we see you. We see what you are. We are not
afraid.

Or we are afraid, but we are looking anyway.

                             EPILOGUE

        (In Which the Author Addresses the Reader Directly,
           Because Certain Things Must Be Said Plainly)

You have been reading a story about a masquerade at the end of the
universe. You have been reading about costumes and conversations
and a mask that was removed at midnight. You have been reading about
the Recession — the expansion of the universe made visible, made
catastrophic, made personal.

But you have also been reading a ghost story.

Not the kind with chains and cold spots and doors that open by
themselves. The kind where the ghost is the future — where the
haunting comes not from something that happened but from something
that will happen, is happening, has always been happening. The
universe is expanding. The galaxies are receding. The sky is
darkening. This is not fiction. This is physics. The timescale is
different — billions of years rather than the compressed six hundred
of this story — but the trajectory is the same. The lights are going
out.

You are a guest at the masquerade. You are wearing a costume. You
are disguised as something that will one day be gone — a species, a
civilization, a world, a self — and the host has promised to remove
his mask at midnight, and midnight is always closer than you think.

What will you see, when the mask comes off?

I do not know. I am the author, not the oracle. I wrote the
invitation, arranged the guest list, described the costumes and the
conversations and the dance. But I did not look beneath the mask.
I stood at the edge of the ballroom, like every author stands at the
edge of every story, and I watched my characters look, and I recorded
what they said they saw, and I chose to believe the twelve-year-old
girl who saw her father's face and felt better rather than worse.

Because that is enough.

Or I hope it is.

Which is, I suppose, the same thing.

    *       *       *       *       *

    The universe, meanwhile, continues to expand.

    The sky, meanwhile, continues to darken.

    And you, meanwhile, continue to read.

    Which means that for now, at least, the lights are still on.

                            [THE END]

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

HARRISON BLACKWOOD is a Vermont recluse who writes about the cosmos the
way certain divines write about Hell: with the authority of a man who
has visited and returned shaken. A veteran of the Pacific Theater and a
lifelong amateur astronomer, Blackwood published his first story in
these pages in 1954 and has been systematically dismantling his readers'
sense of cosmic security ever since. His published works include eight
stories for this magazine, each one darker than the last, and a
monograph on deep-sky observation that three reviewers have described
as "the most beautiful and disturbing book about looking at stars ever
written." He lives alone in the farmhouse where he was born, and he
reports that "Cathedral of Fear" grew from a nightmare he had after
observing the Crab Nebula through a fourteen-inch reflector on a night
of unusual atmospheric clarity. "I saw something in the structure," he
says. "Something that was not astronomical. I have been trying to
describe it ever since." He does not attend conventions, does not own
a telephone, and communicates with this office exclusively by letter.

LUCIAN MARSH was born in Newburyport, Massachusetts, though he insists
on Arkham, and after seven years of correspondence, this editor has
stopped correcting him. A former psychiatric orderly and a graduate of
Brown University, Marsh brings a clinician's eye and a poet's dread to
his tales of isolation, madness, and the thin membrane between the
known and the unknowable. His fiction has appeared exclusively in these
pages, a loyalty for which we are grateful and which we attribute to
either deep affection or profound inertia. He has published twenty-two
stories for this magazine and is rumored to be at work on a novel,
though he denies this with the same vigor with which he denies being
from Newburyport. "Replacement" is, in this editor's judgment, his most
disturbing story to date, which is no small achievement for a man whose
previous work includes "The Lighthouse at Ganymede" and "The Drowned
Station." He lives alone in a rented cottage on the Massachusetts
coast and keeps a cat named Erich, after Mr. Zann.

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW is the finest time-travel writer working in the field
today, a distinction she accepts with characteristic self-deprecation
and a joke about never being on time for anything. A philosopher by
training (University of Pennsylvania) and a paradox-spinner by
vocation, Crenshaw has published twenty stories in these pages, each
one a more intricate temporal knot than the last. Her Hugo-winning
"All Our Yesterdays, Revised" remains one of the most requested
reprints in our history. "Witch of Waystation Nine" represents a new
direction for Crenshaw: darker, lonelier, and more haunted than her
previous work, it is proof that a writer known for intellectual
sparkle can also chill the blood. She lives in Philadelphia with her
husband David, their two children, and a grandfather clock that she
swears runs backward on Tuesdays.

THEODORE CAIN needs no introduction to readers of this magazine, having
appeared in more issues than any other contributor. A Detroit native,
a former autoworker, and a veteran of the Battle of the Bulge, Cain
has been the backbone of "Tales from the Future and Beyond" since issue
number one, producing consistently excellent work across every sub-genre
science fiction has to offer. His forty-odd stories for this magazine
represent a body of work that, taken together, constitutes one of the
most remarkable sustained achievements in the field. "Tooth and Claw"
shows Cain in an unfamiliar mode — horror — and demonstrates that his
famous versatility extends even to the Halloween issue. He lives in
Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean, writes every evening from eight
until midnight, and attributes his prolificacy to "a strong work ethic,
a patient wife, and the absolute refusal to wait for inspiration."

AGNES WHITFIELD grew up on a wheat farm in central Kansas, and her
fiction has never left the prairie — even when it is set on Mars. A
former high school English teacher, Whitfield writes spare, luminous
stories about ordinary people enduring extraordinary circumstances,
and she does so with a plainness and emotional truth that this editor
finds consistently devastating. Her debut story for this magazine,
"After the Sirens" (Issue #13), remains one of the finest post-
apocalyptic stories ever published, and each subsequent work has
confirmed her as a writer of rare and quiet power. "The Passenger"
is her most personal and most unsettling story — a meditation on
foreknowledge, survival, and the marks that the future leaves on us.
She lives on a farm outside Salina, Kansas, writes at the kitchen
table, and reports that the story was inspired by watching her own
reflection age in the window of a Greyhound bus.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY is the kind of writer who kicks down the door,
punches the villain, kisses the girl, and has the story wrapped up
before you've finished your coffee. A Chicago native and a veteran of
the old pulp magazines, Finley has been selling action-adventure
fiction since 1939, and his twenty stories for this magazine represent
the purest distillation of pulp storytelling in our pages. He writes
fast, he writes fun, and he writes stories that grab you by the collar
and don't let go until the last line. "Dead Satellites Spelling" is
Finley in a new key — still fast, still gripping, but with a vein of
genuine dread that surprised even this editor, who has been reading
Finley's work for fifteen years. He lives in Chicago with his wife
Carol, chain-smokes Lucky Strikes, follows the White Sox, and reports
that the story was inspired by a night spent on the roof of his
apartment building, watching satellites cross the sky and wondering
"what the hell they're really up to."

OSCAR LENNOX is a man who cannot stop asking "what if?" and following
each answer to its most distant and disquieting conclusion. A Harvard
historian by training and a philosopher of possibility by temperament,
Lennox has published twenty-two stories in these pages, each one a more
elaborate thought experiment than the last. His Hugo-winning "The
Divergence Engine" and his celebrated "The Lateral View" established him
as the master of alternate-history fiction; "Masque of the Red Shift"
represents something altogether different — a cosmological fable, a
meditation on entropy and witness, and what this editor believes to be
the most ambitious story we have ever published. It is not comfortable
reading. It is not, strictly speaking, reassuring reading. But it is
magnificent reading, and we are honored to close our fourth Halloween
issue with a story that asks, in the most literal possible way, what
happens when the universe removes its mask. Lennox lives in Brookline,
Massachusetts, with his wife Patricia, teaches history at Boston
University, and communicates with this office in letters of such length
and philosophical density that our editorial assistant has taken to
reading them with a dictionary and a pot of strong coffee.

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading "The Cartography of Scars" by Harrison
Blackwood in your July issue (#43), and I must tell you that I have not
slept properly since. The image of the cartographer mapping his own
wounds onto the surface of an alien planet — discovering that the
geography of his suffering is identical to the geography of a world
he has never visited — is one that I cannot remove from my mind. It
sits there like a stone in a shoe. I mean this as the highest possible
compliment. More Blackwood, please, and damn the nightmares.

                                 Louisville, Kentucky

Dear Tales,

I wish to register a formal protest regarding the scientific accuracy
of Dr. Koslov's "Binary Requiem" in your August issue (#44). While I
admire Dr. Koslov's prose enormously and consider him one of the finest
writers of hard SF working today, his treatment of the Roche limit
interaction between the two stars in the story contains an error that I
cannot overlook. Specifically, the mass transfer rate he describes in
Section III would require the donor star to be at least 1.4 solar
masses above the Chandrasekhar limit, which would make it a neutron star
rather than a red giant. I recognize that the story's emotional power
does not depend on this detail, but accuracy matters, and I trust that
Dr. Koslov, as a fellow physicist, would want to know.

                              — Dr. Eleanor Vance
                                 Yerkes Observatory
                                 Williams Bay, Wisconsin

Editor's note: Dr. Koslov has been informed and replies, with
characteristic precision: "Dr. Vance is correct. The error is mine
and is inexcusable. I plead only the mitigating circumstance that I
was writing the scene at three in the morning and had confused my own
notes. The mass transfer rate described is impossible. The story, I
hope, is not." We are pleased to report that a corrected version will
appear in any future reprints.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am writing to express my appreciation for Phyllis Crenshaw's
"The Watchmaker's Paradox" in your August issue. As a horologist by
trade (I repair clocks and watches in a small shop in Providence), I
was delighted to find a story that treats the mechanics of timekeeping
with such intelligence and affection. Mrs. Crenshaw clearly knows her
escapements from her balance wheels, and the scene in which the
protagonist discovers that her grandfather's pocket watch is running
backward through time — not metaphorically, but mechanically, each gear
reversing its rotation — gave me chills. I have since checked all the
clocks in my shop, just in case.

                              — Herbert Lisle
                                 Providence, Rhode Island

Dear Editor,

Two words about Bob Finley's "Lockdown at Phobos Station" in the
September issue (#45): more, please. I read it in one sitting on
the train from Grand Central to Poughkeepsie, and I missed my stop.
I don't care about the science. I don't care about the plausibility.
I care about a hero I can root for, a villain I can hate, and a
plot that moves like a freight train. Finley delivers all three
every single time, and I am tired of critics who look down their
noses at honest entertainment. Not every story has to make me think.
Some just have to make me turn the page. Finley makes me turn the
page faster than any writer in your stable, and I thank him for it.

                              — Frank DiMaggio
                                 Poughkeepsie, New York

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have read Agnes Whitfield's work since her extraordinary debut, and
I want to say that "The Silo" in your September issue is further proof
that she is one of the most underappreciated writers in the field. The
scene at the kitchen table — where the two women discuss whether to
open the silo door, knowing what is outside, knowing what staying
inside will cost them — is the most quietly devastating scene I have
read in any genre this year. Mrs. Whitfield writes about survival the
way a farmer writes about weather: with the knowledge that it is
neither romantic nor optional. I hope your readers are paying attention.

protest, or correction. Write to us at: Letters, Tales from the Future

THE STARS MY DESTINATION by Alfred Bester
(Signet Books, 1956, $0.35)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Bester has done it again. Three years after "The Demolished Man"
redefined what science fiction prose could accomplish, he returns with
a novel of such ferocious energy, such inventive daring, and such
sheer narrative velocity that this reviewer found himself gripping
the book with both hands as if it might fly away. Gully Foyle — the
brutish, vengeful, ultimately transcendent anti-hero at the story's
center — is one of the great characters in the genre's history, a
man remade by hatred into something extraordinary and terrible. The
novel's vision of a future in which teleportation ("jaunting") has
reshaped society is brilliant, its action sequences are breathtaking,
and its final chapters — in which Foyle transcends the limitations
of his own vendetta and confronts something vast and strange — are
among the finest passages Bester has written. This is science fiction
at full throttle: intelligent, audacious, and utterly, magnificently
alive. The highest recommendation.

DOUBLE STAR by Robert A. Heinlein
(Doubleday, 1956, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Heinlein's latest is a compact, elegant novel about an actor who
is hired to impersonate a kidnapped politician — a premise that the
author uses to explore questions of identity, performance, and the
nature of political leadership with characteristic intelligence and
narrative economy. Lorenzo Smythe, the actor-protagonist, is one of
Heinlein's finest creations: vain, talented, and gradually, movingly
transformed by the role he has undertaken. The politics are sharply
drawn, the Martian setting is vivid, and the story moves with the
smooth, frictionless pace that is Heinlein's particular gift. It is
a quieter book than some of his earlier work — no spaceships explode,
no aliens attack — but it is, in this reviewer's judgment, one of
his best. That the best science fiction novel of the year is a
character study about an actor playing a politician says something
important about where the genre is going. Highly recommended.

THE CITY AND THE STARS by Arthur C. Clarke
(Harcourt, Brace, 1956, $3.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clarke's expansion of his earlier "Against the Fall of Night"
arrives as a novel of extraordinary scope and beauty. In the city of
Diaspar, a billion years hence, humanity lives in a sealed paradise,
its citizens cycling endlessly through stored identities, its
architecture maintained by machines that remember everything. Into this
static perfection is born Alvin, the first original human in millions
of years, whose restless curiosity drives him beyond the city's walls
and into a universe that Clarke renders with his customary grandeur.
The novel is a meditation on stagnation and change, on the tension
between safety and exploration, and it contains some of the most
breathtaking descriptive writing Clarke has produced. The vision of
Diaspar itself — a city that is also a mind, a memory, a dream — is
unforgettable. An essential work from one of the genre's masters.

Issue #47 — November 1956

As Era I of "Tales from the Future and Beyond" nears its close, we

November issue:

"THE LAST EQUATION" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A cosmologist discovers

imperceptibly, but with consequences that will reshape reality itself.
A meditation on permanence and the courage required to face a mutable
cosmos. Koslov at his most profound.

"THE HOLLOW FLEET" by Rex Drummond — Captain Jace Rennick returns
for what may be his final adventure: a pursuit through the wreckage
of a battle that ended a century ago, where the ghost ships are not as
empty as they seem. Drummond at full throttle.

"THE INHERITANCE PARADOX" by Phyllis Crenshaw — A woman inherits her
own future self's diary, which describes events that have not yet
occurred and decisions she has not yet made. Crenshaw at her most
inventive and most moving.

manufacturing station discovers that the night shift is producing
something that isn't on the manifest. Cain in fine form.
