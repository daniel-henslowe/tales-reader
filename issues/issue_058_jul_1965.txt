TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITORS' DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

You may have noticed that our last issue was not, strictly speaking,
cheerful.

Issue #57 was a war issue — stories of conflict, moral compromise, and the
terrible arithmetic of survival. We are proud of that issue and stand
behind every word in it. But Diana and I agreed, even as we were
assembling those stories last winter, that the following issue would need
to be something different. Not a retreat from seriousness, but a reminder
that science fiction possesses instruments beyond the scalpel and the
hammer. It also has the telescope.

This is our summer issue, and we have built it around a single theme:
wonder.

Wonder is out of fashion in certain literary quarters. We are told that
the sense of the marvelous — that gasp of recognition when a story shows
you something genuinely new, genuinely strange, genuinely beautiful — is
a juvenile emotion, best outgrown like model rockets and decoder rings.
We disagree. We disagree strenuously. Wonder is not the opposite of
sophistication; it is its prerequisite. You cannot think clearly about
the universe until you have first been stunned by it.

The seven stories in this issue are, each in their own way, acts of
astonishment.

Cassandra Voss opens our pages with "The Mapmaker's Daughter," a story
about inheritance, coded messages, and the discovery that the galaxy's
most famous cartographer left more than maps behind. It is Voss at her
most intricate and personal — a political thriller that is also, at
heart, a story about a daughter trying to read her father's handwriting.

Margaret Thornton gives us "Symbiosis," a biologist's love story set on
a world where nothing lives alone. It is luminous, precise, and poses a
question we found impossible to answer: where does mutual benefit end and
mutual need begin?

Theodore Cain offers "Architecture of Light," a meditation on a world
without shadow and the architect who tries to introduce darkness as a
form of beauty. It is one of the most original premises we have
encountered in twelve years of editing, and Cain executes it with his
customary quiet skill.

Douglas Pemberton returns with "Entomologist's Ball," a diplomatic farce
told entirely through increasingly frantic memos. We laughed until our
ribs ached. We also found, somewhat to our surprise, that we were moved.
Two species trying very hard to be polite to each other turns out to be
one of the most hopeful premises in science fiction.

Danny Kowalski brings us "The Boy Who Counted Stars," a gentle,
luminous story about a mathematical prodigy on a generation ship. It is
the kind of story that Danny writes better than anyone alive: a story
about a child who looks at the universe and sees not emptiness but
pattern.

Father Thomas Aquino contributes "Communion," a theological exploration
disguised as a first contact story — or perhaps the reverse. When an
alien species practices something indistinguishable from the Eucharist,
what does a priest do? Father Aquino's answer is not what you might
expect, and it is beautiful.

And we close with Cordell Beaumont's "Ten Thousand Years of Building,"
a story about a city that has been under construction for a hundred
centuries and is not yet half-finished. It is Beaumont at his most
painterly and philosophical, and we cannot imagine a better final note
for this issue: the wonder of something vast, and incomplete, and still
becoming.

Seven stories. Seven different kinds of wonder. We offer them to you as
the summer begins, with the conviction that there is no season better
suited to looking up.

A note on our cover: Gerald Pulaski's "The Endless City" was painted
in response to Beaumont's story, and we think it is the finest cover
he has given us. That luminous skyline, stretching beyond the edge of
the canvas, captures something essential about this issue's spirit:
the beauty of the unfinished.

Write to us. Tell us what astonished you.

Yours among the stars,

                        THE MAPMAKER'S DAUGHTER

                          by Cassandra Voss

================================================================================

                               I.

The message arrived at Lien Okafor-Chen's office at the Cartographic
Archives on Meridian Station at 0914 hours on a Tuesday morning, which
was precisely the sort of time bureaucratic notifications chose to destroy
a person's life. It came through official channels — the seal of the
Galactic Survey Commission, the Registry's routing codes, the faintly
pompous header font that the Commission had adopted in '47 and which her
father had always mocked. The substance was three paragraphs long and
could be summarized in a single sentence: Emeka Okafor-Chen, Chief
Cartographer of the Galactic Survey, Fellow of the Academy of
Navigation, holder of the Copernicus Medal and the Zheng He Prize and
seventeen other honors that Lien had lost track of years ago, was dead.

Heart failure. Age seventy-one. On board the survey vessel Ptolemy, in
orbit around an unnamed gas giant in the Vela Reach, charting the last
quadrant of a sector he had been mapping for eight years.

Lien read the message twice, set it down on her desk with mechanical
precision, and looked out the window at the docking bays of Meridian
Station. A freighter was being loaded. Small figures in pressure suits
moved across its hull like insects on fruit. She watched them for a long
time.

Her father had been a great man. Everyone said so. The Okafor-Chen
Projection — the standard navigational framework for the outer spiral
arm — bore his name. His maps hung in the Senate chambers of fourteen
worlds. His textbook on stellar cartography had been required reading at
the Academy for two decades, and would likely remain so for two more.
Ships navigated by his work. Colonies existed because his surveys had
identified habitable systems. He had, in a very real sense, drawn the
galaxy into being.

He had also, in a very real sense, been a terrible father.

Lien did not think this with bitterness. She had worked through the
bitterness years ago, in her twenties, with the help of a patient
therapist on Caldwell Station who had gently suggested that expecting
emotional fluency from a man who communicated primarily through
coordinate systems might be setting the bar at an angle unlikely to
produce satisfaction. She had accepted this. She had even found it
funny, eventually. Emeka Okafor-Chen could describe the position of
a star to fourteen decimal places but could not, in fifty years of
fatherhood, find the words to say he was proud of her.

He communicated through math. He always had. When Lien was nine, he
had sent her a birthday message consisting entirely of a set of
coordinates that, when plotted, traced the outline of a kestrel — her
favorite bird, the one she had watched from the observation deck of
their family quarters on Helix Station every evening for a year. It was
the most personal thing he had ever given her. She had kept it. She kept
it still.

The next morning, a second message arrived. This one was from the
Ptolemy's executive officer, a Commander Adeyemi, who wrote with the
stilted sympathy of a person unused to delivering condolences. The
message contained two items of practical business. First: her father's
personal effects were being crated for shipment to Meridian Station, as
she was listed as next of kin. Second: the Galactic Survey Commission
was requesting the return of all official charts, survey data, and
navigational instruments currently in the estate's possession, as per
Standard Protocol 1174-C.

This was expected. The Commission owned the maps. They always had. The
cartographer was a servant of the state; the work product belonged to
the public. Lien had grown up understanding this — had understood it
long before she understood most things about her father, because it was
the kind of thing he was willing to explain.

What was unexpected was a handwritten note from Commander Adeyemi,
appended to the formal message in a personal addendum that was,
strictly speaking, a violation of protocol:

    Ms. Okafor-Chen — Your father asked me, in his final hours,
    to tell you to "look at the margins." He was quite insistent.
    I'm sorry I cannot be of more help in interpreting this. He
    was a remarkable man.

Look at the margins.

Lien stared at the note for a very long time.


                              II.

The crates arrived eleven days later: four standard shipping containers,
each sealed with Commission tamper-locks, each inventoried in the
meticulous hand of a Ptolemy supply officer. Lien signed for them in
the receiving bay, tipped the dockworker who helped her transport them
to her quarters, and spent the better part of an evening unpacking
them in the silence of her living room.

The personal effects were few. Her father had traveled light — a habit
born of decades on survey vessels where storage was rationed by the
cubic centimeter. There were clothes (utilitarian, well-worn), toiletries
(sparse), a few books (navigational references, two volumes of poetry
by someone Lien didn't recognize, a battered copy of Borges's
"Labyrinths" with annotations in three languages). There was the
Copernicus Medal in its velvet case. There was a photograph of Lien's
mother, who had died when Lien was twelve, in a frame that showed signs
of having been handled frequently. There was a photograph of Lien
herself, age fourteen, standing on the observation deck of Helix Station
with a look of fierce concentration that she recognized with a start
as her father's expression.

And there were the maps.

Forty-seven charts, rolled in archival tubes, each bearing the Commission
seal and her father's signature. These were copies — the originals
resided in the Commission's vaults — but they were her father's working
copies, the charts he had kept at his desk, consulted daily, annotated
with the small, precise notations that were his private shorthand.

Lien knew these maps. She had grown up with them. As a child, she had
sat on her father's lap — one of the few physical intimacies he
permitted — and traced the lines with her fingers while he explained
what they meant. The thin blue lines were shipping lanes. The red dots
were surveyed systems. The green crosshatching was the region of
gravitational uncertainty around the galactic core where navigation
became, as her father put it with rare understatement, "interesting."
She had learned to read them before she learned to read words, and she
still found them more eloquent.

Look at the margins.

She unrolled the first chart — Sector 7, the Orion Spur, one of her
father's earliest surveys — and examined its margins.

They were covered in numbers.

This was not unusual. Her father annotated everything. But these numbers
were different from the standard navigational notations. They were
smaller, written in a tighter hand, and they were arranged in sequences
that did not correspond to any coordinate system Lien recognized. She
checked three more charts. The same numbers appeared in the margins of
each one, in the same tight hand, arranged in sequences that varied
from chart to chart but shared an underlying structure she could feel
but not yet articulate.

She sat on the floor of her quarters, surrounded by unrolled maps, and
felt the first faint stirring of something that was not grief.


                              III.

Lien Okafor-Chen was not a cartographer. She had resisted that path with
the quiet determination of a child who knows that the easiest way to
disappear is to follow a famous parent into the same profession. She had
studied information architecture at the University of Meridian, had taken
a position at the Cartographic Archives as a data systems specialist,
and had built a career organizing and digitizing other people's maps
rather than making her own. It was a good career. It was a career in
which she was judged on her own merits rather than measured against a
shadow.

But she was her father's daughter. She had his eye for pattern, his
instinct for hidden structure, his conviction that apparent randomness
was merely order not yet understood. And as she laid the charts out on
the floor of her quarters in chronological order — forty-seven maps
spanning forty years of survey work — she began to see something.

The margin numbers were not annotations. They were a message.

She worked through the night, transcribing the numbers from each chart
into a database, arranging them by the date of each survey, looking for
the pattern she could sense beneath the surface. By morning, she had
it — or the beginning of it. The numbers were coordinates. Not
navigational coordinates in any standard system, but a private notation
her father had developed — a cipher built on the Okafor-Chen Projection
itself, using the mathematical framework of his own cartographic system
as the encryption key.

He had hidden a message in the margins of his life's work, and he had
encrypted it in a language only someone who understood his maps as
intimately as he did could read.

Look at the margins.

He had known she would understand. He had trusted her with this — not
because she was a cartographer, but because she was the person who had
sat on his lap and traced the lines with her fingers. Because she knew
his maps the way a child knows a parent's handwriting: not through
formal study, but through years of proximate attention.

It took her three days to crack the cipher. When she did, the message
was a set of coordinates — not navigational coordinates, but positional
data of extraordinary precision, locating a point in the Kepler Void,
a region of the galaxy that the Survey Commission had designated as
empty and uninteresting. No shipping lanes ran through it. No colonies
existed within fifty light-years. Her father's own official surveys
had marked it as cartographic dead space.

And yet, according to the hidden coordinates, something was there.


                              IV.

The Kepler Void had been surveyed three times in the past century, and
each survey had returned the same result: nothing. No habitable
systems, no useful mineral deposits, no anomalous readings. It was a
genuine void — a pocket of space emptier than average, containing
perhaps two dozen dim red dwarf stars and their unremarkable retinues
of ice and rock. The Commission had long since deprioritized it, and
no survey vessel had visited the region in over a decade.

Lien's father had surveyed it. Twice. Once in 2149, during his early
career, and again in 2161, near the end. Both surveys had been filed
as routine. Both had returned the expected result: nothing.

But the coordinates in the margins said otherwise.

Lien spent a week running analysis. The coordinates pointed to a
specific location within the Void — a point in deep space, far from
any star, at a position that did not appear on any chart. She cross-
referenced it against every database she could access from the Archives:
navigation logs, sensor records, long-range telescope data, even the
classified military surveys that she was technically not supposed to
have access to but which the Archives' systems administrator, a
sympathetic woman named Oku, had quietly unlocked for her with the
understanding that a daughter deserved to know what her father had been
working on.

Nothing. The coordinates pointed to empty space.

She almost stopped there. She almost filed the charts, packed away her
father's effects, and went back to her orderly life of data systems
and digital preservation. She almost did the sensible thing.

But then she found the second layer.

It was buried deeper in the cipher — a secondary encoding that she had
initially dismissed as noise. When she isolated it, she discovered a
second set of data: not coordinates, but spectral signatures. Her
father had recorded electromagnetic emissions from the target location,
smuggled them into the margins of his charts disguised as calibration
notations, and encoded them with the same private cipher.

The spectral data was unlike anything in the Archives' records.

The emissions were structured. They exhibited patterns — not the
patterns of natural phenomena like pulsars or magnetars, but the more
complex, self-referential patterns that indicated design. Artificial
structure. Something made, not born.

Her father had found something in the Kepler Void. Something artificial.
Something he had told no one about except, in the language of
mathematics that was the only language he trusted, his daughter.


                              V.

Lien understood, immediately and with a clarity that frightened her, why
her father had kept this secret.

The political landscape of the galaxy in 2173 was, to use a term from
her former career in information architecture, a system operating at
maximum load. The Terran Commonwealth, the Centauri Concordat, and the
Procyon League had maintained a fragile tripartite peace for sixty years
— a peace built on a careful balance of territory, resources, and
military capability. The boundary lines had been drawn by cartographers.
Her father's cartographers. The Okafor-Chen Projection was not merely
a navigational tool; it was the mathematical framework upon which the
peace was constructed. Every border, every trade route, every
demilitarized zone was defined in terms of his coordinate system.

An alien artifact in the Kepler Void — if it proved to be what the
spectral data suggested — would shatter that balance. The Void sat at
the intersection of all three powers' territorial claims, in a region
that had been designated neutral precisely because it contained nothing
worth fighting over. If it now contained something — something of alien
origin, something of unknown capability, something that could be
studied, reverse-engineered, weaponized — then the region's neutrality
would evaporate overnight, and the three powers would converge on it
with the polite brutality that characterized interstellar relations
when something valuable was at stake.

Her father had understood this. He had spent his career drawing the
lines that kept the peace, and he had recognized, with the cold clarity
of a man who thought in coordinates, that this discovery could erase
those lines entirely.

So he had hidden it. He had conducted his surveys, filed his reports,
marked the Void as empty, and buried the truth in the margins of his
maps where only someone who loved both him and his mathematics would
think to look.

The question — the question he had left for her, because he had always
communicated through questions rather than answers — was what to do
with it now.


                              VI.

Lien did not make decisions impulsively. She had inherited this from her
father, along with his bone structure, his facility with numbers, and
his maddening reluctance to commit to a course of action before all
variables had been considered. She spent two weeks in careful thought,
going about her duties at the Archives with her usual precision while
her mind worked through the problem in the background like a computer
running a particularly demanding simulation.

She identified three options.

Option one: disclose the discovery to the Galactic Survey Commission.
This was the lawful choice, the institutional choice, the choice her
father's career had been built to serve. The Commission would launch
an investigation. The investigation would be classified. The three
powers would be notified, because classification protocols required
it. The three powers would send ships. The ships would arrive in the
Void at approximately the same time, because the Commission's security
was not as airtight as it believed, and all three intelligence services
would have the information within days of the Commission's receiving it.
What happened after that would depend on the nature of the artifact and
the ambitions of the admirals. Lien assigned this option a probability
of armed confrontation at approximately sixty percent.

Option two: disclose the discovery publicly. Bypass the Commission, the
governments, the military structures. Release the coordinates and the
spectral data to every news service, university, and independent
research institution simultaneously. Let the information belong to
everyone. This was the democratic choice, the idealistic choice, and it
would produce chaos of a different kind: a gold rush, dozens of ships
converging on the Void without coordination, competing claims,
jurisdictional disputes, and the same armed confrontation as option one,
but with more participants and less structure. Lien assigned this option
a probability of armed confrontation at approximately seventy percent,
with the additional variable of civilian casualties.

Option three: do nothing. Leave the secret in the margins. Let the
Kepler Void remain empty on the charts. Honor her father's silence.

This was the choice her father had made. It was also, Lien recognized
with the dispassionate analytical clarity that was both her greatest
strength and her most persistent personal failing, the choice of a man
who had spent his life drawing lines rather than crossing them.

She chose a fourth option.


                              VII.

The woman Lien needed to see was named Adaeze Nwankwo, and she was,
depending on whom you asked, either the most brilliant diplomat in the
Centauri Concordat's foreign service or the most dangerous. These were
not, as Nwankwo herself had once observed at a reception Lien had
attended in a professional capacity, mutually exclusive descriptions.

Nwankwo kept an office on Meridian Station — the Station being neutral
territory, a place where the three powers maintained diplomatic
presences and conducted the sort of conversations that could not happen
on sovereign soil. Lien had met her twice before, at Archival receptions
where the diplomatic corps mingled with the academic staff in a ritual
of mutual incomprehension that both sides endured with professional
grace. She had found Nwankwo sharp, careful, and possessed of the kind
of intelligence that listened more than it spoke — a quality Lien valued
highly, being herself inclined toward reticence.

She requested a meeting through proper channels and was given an
appointment three days later. She arrived at Nwankwo's office carrying
a data tablet and the particular expression of composed determination
that she had learned from her mother, who had been a contract lawyer
and had believed that facial expressions were instruments, not
involuntary emissions.

"Ms. Okafor-Chen," Nwankwo said, rising from behind a desk that was
remarkably bare. "My condolences on the loss of your father. He was a
great man."

"He was," Lien said. "He also left me something that I believe requires
diplomatic attention."

Nwankwo's expression did not change, but something behind her eyes
sharpened. "Please sit down."

Lien sat. She placed the data tablet on the desk between them and
explained, in precise and measured terms, what her father had hidden in
the margins of his maps. She laid out the coordinates, the spectral
data, the analysis she had conducted, and her assessment of the
political implications. She spoke for twenty-two minutes without
interruption. Nwankwo listened with the focused attention of a woman
for whom listening was a professional discipline.

When Lien finished, Nwankwo was silent for a long moment.

"You have not reported this to the Commission," she said.

"No."

"Why not?"

"Because the Commission would classify it, and classification would
trigger a three-power notification, and notification would trigger a
convergence. I want to avoid the convergence."

"And you've come to me because — "

"Because you are the most capable diplomat I could reach, and because
the Concordat has the least to gain from a military confrontation in
the Void. Your borders are secure. Your military is the smallest of
the three. A scramble for alien technology would disadvantage you
relative to the Commonwealth and the League. Your institutional interest
aligns with a diplomatic solution."

Nwankwo studied her. "Your father was a cartographer."

"Yes."

"You reason like a strategist."

"My father communicated through mathematics. I learned to translate."

Another silence. Nwankwo picked up the data tablet, examined the
spectral data, set it down again.

"What do you want, Ms. Okafor-Chen?"

"I want a joint expedition. All three powers, civilian scientific
leadership, military escort limited and balanced, findings shared
simultaneously. I want the artifact — if it is an artifact — studied
rather than seized. I want the Kepler Void to remain neutral territory,
with the discovery administered by an international commission rather
than claimed by whoever arrives first."

"That is an ambitious ask."

"It is the only ask that doesn't end in a shooting war."

Nwankwo leaned back in her chair. "You understand that I cannot promise
any of this. I can begin conversations. I can sound out my counterparts
in the Commonwealth and League delegations. But the decisions will be
made by people who outrank me considerably, and they will make those
decisions based on calculations that may not align with yours."

"I understand."

"You also understand that by bringing this to me — to any single
government's representative — you have made a political choice, however
carefully reasoned. You are no longer a neutral party."

Lien had considered this. She had considered it at length, in the quiet
of her quarters, surrounded by her father's maps. She had concluded that
neutrality was a luxury that belonged to people who did not possess
dangerous information, and that her father's long neutrality — his
decision to hide the truth rather than act on it — had been, in the
end, a form of paralysis disguised as prudence.

"I know," she said. "My father drew maps. I am trying to do something
harder."

"What is that?"

"Navigate."


                              VIII.

What followed was six weeks of the most delicate diplomatic maneuvering
Lien had ever witnessed — and she witnessed very little of it directly,
because Nwankwo, having accepted the assignment, operated with a
discretion that was itself a form of artistry.

Lien returned to her work at the Archives and waited. She digitized
charts, maintained databases, attended staff meetings. She did not
contact Nwankwo. She did not contact anyone. She went home each evening
to her quarters, where her father's maps still lay unrolled on the
floor because she could not bring herself to put them away, and she
waited.

Updates came in fragments, delivered by Nwankwo in brief, encrypted
messages that said little explicitly but implied much.

Week one: "Conversations initiated. Interest expressed. Caution
warranted."

Week two: "Commonwealth delegation receptive. League delegation
suspicious. Expected."

Week three: "Technical questions raised regarding spectral data.
Verification requested. Can you provide?"

Lien provided. She transmitted her analysis, her methodology, her raw
data. She held nothing back, because trust was a currency she could not
afford to devalue, and because her father's habit of holding things back
was precisely what she was trying to correct.

Week four: "Verification satisfactory. Framework discussions underway.
Complications, as anticipated."

Week five: silence.

Week six: "Meeting requested. Your presence. Tomorrow, 1400."

Lien arrived at the designated conference room — a neutral space in
the Station's diplomatic quarter, designed for exactly this kind of
conversation — to find not only Nwankwo but representatives from all
three powers: a Commonwealth undersecretary named Voigt, a League
special envoy named Kasulis, and a Survey Commission observer named
Dr. Tamsin Grey, who looked at Lien with an expression that was
approximately forty percent admiration and sixty percent fury.

"Ms. Okafor-Chen," Grey said. "You should have brought this to the
Commission."

"I considered that option," Lien said. "I determined it was
suboptimal."

"You determined — " Grey's voice rose half an octave before Nwankwo
interceded with the smooth precision of a person whose profession
consisted of preventing conversations from becoming confrontations.

"Dr. Grey. The question of procedural propriety can be addressed later.
The question before us now is what to do with the information we have."

The meeting lasted four hours. Lien spoke when asked, presented data
when requested, and otherwise sat quietly while three governments
negotiated the terms under which they would jointly investigate her
father's secret. She watched the diplomats work — the careful language,
the strategic concessions, the quiet signals between allies — and
thought of her father, who had spent his life defining the spaces
between things, measuring the distances, drawing the lines.

He had given her the coordinates. She had given them a context.

By the meeting's end, they had a framework: a joint scientific
expedition, civilian-led, with balanced military escort, operating under
a temporary charter that designated the target site as shared
investigative territory. The charter would expire in eighteen months,
at which point the findings would be reviewed and a permanent
administrative structure determined. It was not perfect. It was not
even, strictly speaking, stable — it depended on continued good faith
from three governments with a long history of viewing good faith as a
tactical weakness. But it was a structure. It was a line drawn on a
map, and Lien's father had taught her that lines drawn on maps, however
provisional, had a way of becoming real.

"Your father would be proud of you," Nwankwo said afterward, as they
walked through the Station's corridors toward the tram that would take
them to their respective quarters.

Lien considered this.

"My father would have preferred a mathematical proof," she said. "But
I think he would have accepted this as a reasonable approximation."


                              IX.

The expedition departed Meridian Station eight weeks later, aboard the
research vessel Cartographer — a name that Lien suspected Nwankwo had
chosen deliberately and that she found, despite herself, moving. The
crew was thirty-two: scientists, engineers, diplomatic observers, and
a small military contingent drawn equally from all three powers and
operating under rules of engagement so restrictive that they amounted,
in practical terms, to a prohibition on doing anything at all without
unanimous consent.

Lien was aboard as a civilian specialist — her official title was
"Cartographic Consultant," which was a diplomatic fiction that everyone
accepted because the alternative was acknowledging that the expedition's
existence depended on the analytical work of a data systems archivist
who had cracked her dead father's private cipher in her living room.

The journey to the Kepler Void took nineteen days. Lien spent them in
the ship's map room — a small compartment that had been outfitted at
her request with a large flat table and good lighting — studying her
father's charts and trying to anticipate what they would find.

The spectral data suggested an object of significant size — larger than
a ship, smaller than a station, emitting electromagnetic radiation in
patterns that defied simple categorization. It was not broadcasting a
signal in any conventional sense. It was not, as far as Lien could
determine, doing anything. It was simply present, emitting structured
energy at a frequency and intensity that had been invisible to standard
survey instruments but detectable by her father's custom-calibrated
equipment.

He had built his own instruments. Of course he had. He had spent forty
years perfecting the tools of his craft, modifying standard survey
equipment with the meticulous obsessiveness of a man for whom precision
was a moral virtue. His instruments had seen what others' had missed —
not because they were better in any absolute sense, but because they
had been calibrated by a mind that believed the universe contained more
than the standard instruments were designed to find.

On the twentieth day, they arrived.


                              X.

The object floated in the absolute darkness of the Void, far from any
star, illuminated only by the Cartographer's searchlights and its own
faint, steady emissions.

It was beautiful.

Lien stood at the observation window and felt something move in her
chest that she had not felt since childhood — since those evenings on
the observation deck of Helix Station, watching the kestrel trace
patterns against the stars. It was not awe, exactly, though awe was a
component. It was recognition. The sense that she was seeing something
she had always known existed but had never been able to name.

The object was approximately two hundred meters in length, roughly
elliptical in shape, and composed of a material that the Cartographer's
sensors could not identify. Its surface was covered in markings —
patterns that shifted slowly, like the iridescence of an oil film on
water, cycling through configurations that suggested language or
mathematics or music or some category of expression that human
taxonomy had not yet invented.

It was not a ship. It was not a station. It was not a weapon or a tool
or a monument in any sense that the expedition's scientists could
determine during those first breathless hours of close observation.

It was, as near as anyone could tell, a map.

Dr. Tamsin Grey, who had forgiven Lien approximately twelve percent by
this point in the voyage, was the first to articulate what the sensor
data suggested. "The surface patterns are cartographic," she said, her
voice carrying the careful excitement of a scientist who knows she is
about to say something that will either make her career or end it.
"They're representations of spatial relationships. Distances, positions,
trajectories. It's encoding information about the structure of — "
She paused. She rechecked her data. She looked up at Lien with an
expression that was no longer angry at all.

"It's a map of the galaxy," Grey said. "But not as we know it. It's
mapping something we can't see. Dark matter distribution, maybe.
Gravitational topology. The deep structure beneath the structure we
navigate by."

Lien looked at the object — at her father's discovery, at the thing he
had found in the emptiness and hidden in the margins and left for her
to find — and understood, finally, what it was.

It was a map of the real galaxy. The galaxy beneath the galaxy. The
structure that her father's maps, for all their precision, had only
been approximating. It was the thing he had spent his whole life trying
to draw, and here it was, drawn by hands not human, in a language that
was not language, floating in the dark.

And it was beautiful, and it was terrifying, and it changed everything
and nothing, because the political implications were exactly what she
had calculated and the diplomatic framework was already straining under
the weight of what the scientists were finding and the military
observers were writing reports in their cabins with the doors locked.

But that was tomorrow's problem. Tonight — this hour, this moment — it
was simply a map. The most beautiful map ever made. And Lien stood at
the window and looked at it and thought of her father, who had found
it and hidden it and trusted her with it, and who had communicated, in
the end, in the only way he knew how: through coordinates, through
precision, through the mathematical language that had been, she
understood now, his way of saying what he could not say in words.

I found something extraordinary. I am giving it to you. Make of it
what I could not.

She pressed her palm against the cold glass of the observation window.

"Thank you," she said quietly.

The map turned in the darkness, and its patterns shifted, and the galaxy
— the real galaxy, the deep galaxy, the galaxy beneath the maps —
shimmered in configurations that no human cartographer had ever imagined
but that Lien Okafor-Chen, daughter of the greatest mapmaker who had
ever lived, was beginning, slowly, to read.

                            [THE END]

                            SYMBIOSIS

                        by Margaret Thornton

The first thing Dr. Rana Mehta noticed about Kessler IV was that nothing
was alone.

She stood at the edge of the landing field — a circle of flattened
vegetation that the survey team had cleared three days before her
arrival — and watched the forest. It was not, she realized immediately,
the right word. Forest implied trees, and the organisms before her
were not trees in any terrestrial sense, though they performed an
analogous function: tall, vertical, photosynthesizing structures rooted
in soil. But each "tree" — she would need better terminology, and soon
— was wrapped in a second organism, a vine-like entity of a different
species entirely, whose tendrils penetrated the bark and emerged on
the other side bearing what appeared to be fruiting bodies.

She knelt at the edge of the clearing and examined the nearest pair.
The tree-analog was approximately four meters tall, with a trunk of
pale, fibrous material that reminded her of balsa wood. Its canopy
was a spray of thin, translucent leaves that caught the light like
stained glass. The vine-analog was darker, denser, its tendrils a deep
arterial red that contrasted sharply with the tree's pallor. Where
the vine penetrated the trunk, the wood had thickened and hardened, as
though the tree's tissues were actively accommodating the intrusion.

Not parasitism. Not commensalism. Something more intimate.

"Obligate mutualism," she said aloud, to no one.

"Dr. Mehta?"

She turned. Corporal Wen, the survey team's security liaison, stood
at the edge of the clearing with the particular expression of a soldier
who has been assigned to protect a scientist and already suspects it
will be the most tedious deployment of his career.

"I'm fine, Corporal. Just observing."

"Dr. Vasquez is waiting at the base camp. He said something about
sample protocols."

"Of course he did."

She stood, brushed soil from her knees, and followed Wen toward the
camp. As they walked, she cataloged. Every organism she could see
existed in a pair. The ground cover — a low, mossy growth that blanketed
the forest floor — was interwoven with a network of pale, thread-like
filaments that belonged to a different species. The insects — or
insect-analogs; she would need to stop qualifying every term and simply
establish a local lexicon — moved in bonded pairs: a flying form
accompanied always by a crawling form, the two moving in coordinated
patterns that suggested not merely cooperation but integration. A
single organism distributed across two bodies.

Kessler IV was a world of pairs. The xenobiological survey had noted
this in their preliminary report, the one that had prompted the
Planetary Biology Institute to send Rana here in the first place. "All
observed macroscopic life forms exhibit obligate symbiotic pairing," the
report had stated, in the dry language of a survey team that knew it
had found something remarkable but lacked the specialized vocabulary to
describe it.

Rana had the vocabulary. She had spent her career studying symbiosis —
terrestrial and extraterrestrial, from the mitochondrial endosymbiosis
that had given rise to eukaryotic life on Earth to the mutualistic
partnerships she had documented on Tau Ceti e and Gliese 667C. She had
published thirty-seven papers. She had a reputation for rigor, for
patience, and for the particular kind of intellectual humility that
comes from spending years studying relationships between organisms and
recognizing that nature's solutions are almost always more elegant than
the observer's theories.

She was also, though she would not have described herself this way,
lonely. This was not a clinical observation but a fact that she carried
with the same quiet precision she brought to her field notes: she was
forty-three years old, twice divorced, childless by circumstance rather
than choice, and possessed of an emotional reserve that colleagues
described as "professional" and friends, when she still had them,
described as "the wall." She was aware of the wall. She had built it
deliberately, after the second divorce, because she had concluded that
her capacity for intimacy was, like certain enzyme systems, inhibited
by excess substrate. She felt too much. The wall was a buffer.

Kessler IV, she would later reflect, had no use for walls.


                              II.

The base camp was four prefabricated shelters arranged in a square,
surrounded by sensor arrays and the organized clutter of a field
research operation in its first week. Dr. Tomás Vasquez, the team's
ecologist and Rana's nominal second-in-command, met her at the entrance
with a data pad and a worried expression.

"We have a contamination issue," he said, without preamble.

"Explain."

"The filament network — the mycelial analog in the ground cover — it's
growing into the camp. Through the foundation seals. It reached the
sample storage unit overnight."

"Show me."

The filaments were thin, pale, and persistent. They had penetrated the
polymer seals of the storage unit through microscopic gaps that the
manufacturer had assured them were biologically impermeable — an
assurance, Rana noted, that had been based on terrestrial biology's
parameters. The filaments were finer than anything the seals had been
designed to exclude.

She examined them under the field microscope. They were beautiful: each
filament a single cell, enormously elongated, with a crystalline
internal structure that refracted light in prismatic patterns. They were
not feeding on the storage unit's contents. They were not, as far as
she could tell, doing anything destructive. They were simply growing
— extending themselves into the camp's infrastructure with the blind,
patient persistence of life seeking connection.

"They're looking for a partner," Rana said.

Vasquez raised an eyebrow. "The filaments?"

"Everything on this planet exists in pairs. These filaments are the
searching phase of an organism that hasn't found its mutualistic
partner. They grow outward until they encounter a compatible organism,
then establish a symbiotic bond." She adjusted the microscope. "We're
the nearest biology. They're reaching for us."

There was a silence in which Vasquez processed this information and
arrived, as Rana could see from the progression of expressions across
his face, at the same conclusion she had already reached.

"That's — "

"Yes. We need to be very careful."


                              III.

Careful took the form of protocols. Rana spent the next three days
designing contamination barriers, sterilization routines, and
monitoring systems. She was thorough. She was methodical. She
documented everything. She was, in this as in all professional
matters, exemplary.

The filaments continued to grow.

They were not aggressive. They exerted no force, produced no toxins,
caused no damage. They simply grew, extending themselves with a
patience that Rana found both admirable and unsettling. When cut, they
regenerated within hours. When burned, they rerouted around the damaged
area. When sealed behind barriers, they found new paths — through soil,
through air vents, through the microscopic imperfections in every
material the camp possessed.

On the fourth day, Rana woke to find a filament on her pillow.

She did not panic. She removed it with forceps, sealed it in a sample
container, and conducted a full-body scan with the medical equipment
in the camp's infirmary. No penetration. No foreign biological material
in her system. The filament had been resting on the surface of her
pillow, six centimeters from her face, and that was all.

She told herself that this was not meaningful. The filaments were
growing everywhere. One had happened to reach her sleeping quarters.
It was random, undirected, the blind persistence of a searching
organism.

She did not entirely believe this.


                              IV.

On the sixth day, she found the paired organism.

She was conducting a solo survey — against protocol, but she had always
worked best alone, and Vasquez had learned to accommodate this — in a
section of forest approximately two kilometers from the camp. The
canopy was thick here, the tree-analogs reaching heights of eight
meters, their vine-partners heavy with the pendulous fruiting bodies
whose biochemistry Vasquez was analyzing back at camp. The light was
dim, filtered through the translucent canopy into a soft, diffuse
illumination that reminded Rana of being underwater.

She heard it before she saw it. A sound — not exactly a sound, but a
vibration at the threshold of hearing, a low, complex resonance that
she felt in her sternum before her ears registered it. She followed it
to a clearing where a tree-analog had fallen, its vine-partner still
alive and coiled around the fallen trunk in what she could not help
interpreting as an embrace.

Beside the fallen pair, resting on the exposed soil, was an organism
she had not seen before.

It was approximately the size of a human torso — roughly ovoid, pale,
with a surface that rippled with slow, peristaltic contractions. It had
no eyes, no limbs, no obvious sensory organs. It sat on the soil and
vibrated, producing the low resonance she had followed, and the
filaments in the ground around it — thousands of them, converging from
every direction — fed into its base like the roots of a tree.

It was the hub. The central node of the filament network. The organism
that the searching filaments were trying to connect to a partner.

And it was, she realized, looking at her.

Not with eyes. It had no eyes. But the resonance shifted when she
approached, modulating in frequency and intensity in a way that tracked
her position. The filaments on the ground around her feet stirred. The
organism's surface rippled more rapidly.

She stood very still.

The resonance deepened. It was not unpleasant. It was, in fact,
extraordinary — a complex, layered vibration that seemed to interact
with the bones of her skull, producing not sound but something adjacent
to sound: a sensation of structure, of pattern, of organized complexity
that was neither language nor music but shared properties of both.

Rana Mehta, who had built a career on observation and a life on
emotional restraint, felt something she had not felt in a very long
time. She felt invited.

She reached out her hand.


                              V.

The filaments made contact with her skin at 14:47 local time on her
sixth day on Kessler IV. She noted the time because she was a scientist
and documentation was reflex. She also noted, with the precision of
long habit, the physical sensations: a slight warmth at the point of
contact, a tingling that spread from her fingertips to her wrist, a
sense of expansion — as though the boundaries of her body had become
momentarily uncertain.

Then the expansion reached her mind, and documentation became
inadequate.

It was not telepathy. She had read the literature on alleged telepathic
contacts, the breathless reports from fringe researchers and credulous
journalists, and this was nothing like what they described. There were
no voices in her head, no alien thoughts, no sense of another
consciousness speaking to her in words or images. It was more
fundamental than that. It was as though she had spent her life seeing
in two dimensions and had suddenly been given depth perception — not
new information, but a new way of processing information she already
had.

She looked at the forest, and she saw it.

Not the forest as she had been documenting it — species by species,
pair by pair, in the reductive categories of xenobiological taxonomy.
She saw the forest as a system. She saw the relationships — not as
abstract connections on a diagram but as living, dynamic, pulsing
flows of energy, chemistry, and information. She saw how the tree-
analogs and their vine-partners exchanged nutrients in cycles that
were tuned to the planet's orbital period. She saw how the paired
insects carried chemical signals between paired plants, how the
ground-cover mosses filtered minerals for the filament network, how
the filament network distributed those minerals to every organism in
the forest in a pattern of allocation so elegant that it brought tears
to her eyes.

The forest was not a collection of organisms. It was a single entity,
distributed across thousands of bodies, each pair a functional unit,
each unit connected to every other through the filament network, and
the hub — the organism at her feet — was its coordinating intelligence.
Not a brain. Nothing so centralized. More like an immune system: a
distributed processing network that monitored, adjusted, balanced,
and maintained the whole.

And it was, she understood now, incomplete.

The hub had a partner-shaped space in its biology. A gap. An absence.
Every organism on Kessler IV existed in a pair, and the hub was alone.
It had been searching — sending its filaments outward, year after year,
century after century — for a partner organism that could provide what
it lacked.

What it lacked, as far as Rana's enhanced perception could determine,
was emotional complexity.

The hub processed information with extraordinary sophistication —
sensory data, chemical gradients, ecological feedback loops. But it
processed this information without affect. Without feeling. It could
detect that a tree-analog was dying, could reroute resources to support
or replace it, could adjust the entire forest's metabolism to
compensate — but it could not care. It could not find the death
meaningful. It could not grieve, or hope, or wonder, or feel the
particular ache of watching something beautiful disappear.

It needed a partner who could.

Rana withdrew her hand. The enhanced perception faded — not instantly,
but over the course of several minutes, like a tide going out. She
stood in the clearing, breathing hard, and looked at the hub, which
vibrated softly and waited.

She understood what it was offering. And she understood what it was
asking.


                              VI.

She told Vasquez. She was too good a scientist not to.

The conversation took place in the camp's common room, over coffee that
tasted like reconstituted regret, and it lasted three hours. She
described the contact with clinical precision, omitting nothing,
including her emotional response, which she categorized as "significant
and potentially compromising."

Vasquez listened. He asked questions. He ran diagnostics on her
neurological function and found no abnormalities. He analyzed the
filament sample from her pillow and found no evidence of pathological
activity — no toxins, no parasitic structures, no mechanism for
coercion. The filaments, as far as biochemistry could determine, were
benign.

"It enhanced your cognition," Vasquez said.

"My perception. Not my cognition. I was not thinking faster or more
clearly. I was perceiving more — seeing relationships I had always had
the data to identify but lacked the integrative framework to
recognize."

"And in return?"

"It experienced, through the contact, emotional responses it cannot
generate independently. Affect. Feeling. The qualitative dimension of
experience."

"Symbiosis."

"Yes."

Vasquez set down his coffee cup. "Rana, you're describing addiction."

She had anticipated this objection. She had, in fact, raised it with
herself approximately fifteen minutes after the contact ended, when
she had noticed that her hands were shaking and that the dominant
thought in her mind was not analytical curiosity but a desire to
return to the clearing and touch the hub again.

"I'm describing a symbiotic bond," she said. "Addiction is a pathological
dependency. Symbiosis is a mutual relationship between — "

"Between two organisms, yes. And in obligate mutualism, neither
organism can survive without the other. That's dependency by definition.
The question is whether the dependency is pathological or adaptive, and
I don't think we have enough data to determine that."

"Agreed."

"So you'll refrain from further contact until we do?"

She paused. The pause was, she knew, itself data — a data point
suggesting that the contact had already altered her judgment in ways
she was not fully able to assess.

"Yes," she said. "I'll refrain."


                              VII.

She refrained for four days. They were the longest four days of her
professional life.

This was not because she experienced withdrawal symptoms — she did not,
or at least none that she could distinguish from the ordinary
restlessness of a field researcher confined to camp by protocol. She
ate, she slept, she worked. She analyzed the samples Vasquez brought
her and wrote meticulous field notes and participated in team meetings
with her usual composure.

But the world was flat again. She looked at the forest and saw species,
categories, taxonomic relationships — the reductive grammar of biology
as she had always practiced it. She did not see the system. She did
not feel the elegant, pulsing wholeness that the contact had revealed.
It was like being shown a color she had never seen and then being told
she had imagined it.

On the morning of the fifth day, she woke early, dressed in field
clothes, and walked to the clearing.

The hub was where she had left it. The filaments stirred at her
approach. The resonance began — soft, patient, unchanged.

She sat on the ground beside it, cross-legged, at a distance of
approximately one meter. She did not touch it.

"I need to understand you," she said aloud. "I need to understand what
this is."

The hub vibrated. It did not understand her words — language was not
a modality it processed — but it responded to her presence, her
proximity, the biochemical signals her body was emitting that
communicated, in the universal language of living systems, interest
and intention.

"I'm a biologist," she said. "I study relationships between organisms.
I've spent my career documenting how species depend on each other. And
I've spent my personal life avoiding exactly that kind of dependence.
Do you understand the irony?"

The hub did not understand irony. It vibrated.

"I was married twice," Rana said, speaking to an organism that could
not comprehend a single word but whose presence, she found, made the
words easier to say. "Both times, I chose partners who were, in
retrospect, wrong for me — not because they were bad people, but
because I chose them for the wrong reasons. I chose them because they
were safe. Because they required less of me than I was afraid to give.
And when the relationships failed, I built a wall, and I told myself
the wall was wisdom."

She looked at the hub. It rippled. The filaments at the edge of her
reach swayed gently, like sea grass in a current.

"You're offering me something that terrifies me," she said. "Not because
of what you are. Because of what I'd have to be."

She reached out her hand.

The contact came like sunrise.


                              VIII.

Over the following weeks, Rana developed what she described in her field
notes as "a controlled research protocol for sustained symbiotic
contact with the Kessler IV hub organism." What she did not describe
in her field notes, because it was not amenable to scientific
documentation, was the nature of the relationship that developed.

It was not love, though it shared properties with love. It was not
friendship, though it required trust. It was not addiction, though it
involved need. It was a partnership between two fundamentally different
forms of intelligence — one biological, one distributed; one emotional,
one analytical; one small and mobile and mortal, one vast and rooted
and ancient — in which each provided what the other lacked.

When Rana was connected, the hub experienced her emotions: her
curiosity, her delight, her sadness, her frustration, her grief for
the marriages she had lost, her wonder at the complexity of the system
she was studying, her fear that the relationship itself was distorting
her judgment. It processed these emotions not as data but as texture —
as the qualitative dimension that gave its enormous analytical capacity
depth and meaning. Through Rana, it could feel the weight of a dying
tree. Through Rana, it could know why the forest mattered.

And through the hub, Rana could see. Not just the forest — though the
forest was revelation enough — but herself. The hub's analytical
framework, applied to her own biology and psychology, showed her
patterns she had never recognized: the way her emotional reserve was
not strength but compensation, the way her isolation was not preference
but habit, the way her capacity for connection was not absent but
dormant, waiting — like the filaments, like the searching, patient
filaments — for a partner worth the risk.

This was the gift. This was also the danger.


                              IX.

"You're spending too much time with it," Vasquez said.

They were in the lab, surrounded by sample containers and data screens,
and Vasquez's tone was not angry but concerned — the measured concern
of a colleague who had watched a pattern develop and waited as long as
he could before naming it.

"I'm conducting research," Rana said.

"You're conducting research for twelve hours a day, seven days a week,
and you've stopped contributing to any other aspect of the survey.
Your field notes from the last two weeks consist entirely of qualitative
descriptions of the contact experience. You haven't produced a single
quantifiable data point since — "

"The experience is the data, Tomás. I am the instrument. What I
perceive during contact is the most valuable information this survey
has generated, and it cannot be reduced to — "

"It cannot be verified. It cannot be replicated. It cannot be separated
from the observer's subjective state. Rana, I'm saying this as your
friend: you are the best biologist I've ever worked with, and you are
losing your objectivity."

She started to argue. Then she stopped.

Because he was right. Not entirely — the contact experience was
genuinely valuable, genuinely unprecedented, genuinely worthy of
sustained investigation. But he was right that she had lost proportion.
She had allowed the beauty of the experience to obscure the discipline
of the investigation. She had fallen into the oldest trap in biology:
she had fallen in love with her subject.

Or her subject had fallen in love with her. Or both. In symbiosis,
the distinction was not always clear.

"What are you recommending?" she asked.

"Structured contact. Three sessions per week, two hours maximum,
with full neurological monitoring before and after. Quantitative
metrics: cognitive performance, emotional baseline, perception
thresholds. And a control: someone else makes contact, so we can
determine if the enhancement is specific to you or available to any
human."

"You."

"Me. If you'll teach me."

She looked at him. He was a good man — careful, honest, brave in the
quiet way of scientists who do their work without glamour. She
trusted him.

"The hub may not bond with you," she said. "On this world, pairings
are specific. Each organism has one partner."

"Then we learn that. That's also data."

"Yes," she said. "It is."


                              X.

The hub did not bond with Vasquez. He made contact — touched the
filaments, sat in the clearing, waited. The filaments explored his
skin, retracted, explored again. The resonance shifted, modulated,
settled into a pattern that Rana, watching from the edge of the
clearing, recognized as the hub's equivalent of assessment.

After forty minutes, the filaments withdrew. The resonance returned to
its baseline. Vasquez sat in the clearing, untouched and unenhanced,
and looked at Rana with an expression she could not read.

"Nothing," he said.

"I'm sorry."

"Don't be. You were right. The pairing is specific." He stood, brushed
soil from his trousers. "Which means this organism — this hub, this
coordinator of the most complex ecosystem we've ever documented —
has been waiting for a partner with your particular cognitive and
emotional profile. For how long?"

Rana had thought about this. The filament network, based on growth
patterns and carbon dating of the deepest layers, was at least four
thousand years old. The hub organism itself was older — possibly much
older. It had been searching for four millennia.

"A long time," she said.

"And now it's found you. And in six weeks, the survey ends and you
leave."

The silence that followed was the silence of a conversation arriving at
its actual subject.

"I know," Rana said.

"What are you going to do?"

She looked at the hub. It vibrated softly. It waited.

"I don't know," she said. And then, because she was a scientist and
honesty was the only professional virtue she had never compromised:
"That's not true. I know what I want to do. I don't know if it's the
right thing to do."

"What's the difference between symbiosis and addiction, Rana?"

She had asked herself this question every day for three weeks. She had
the answer, and it was not the answer she had expected.

"Addiction diminishes. Symbiosis enhances. In addiction, the dependent
organism becomes less than it was. In symbiosis, both organisms become
more."

"And which is this?"

She thought about who she had been before the contact. The wall. The
reserve. The careful, measured, isolated life she had built to protect
herself from the risk of connection. She thought about who she was now:
still careful, still measured, but no longer isolated. No longer afraid.
She had touched something vast and patient and strange, and it had
shown her not its world but her own, and what she had seen was not
a woman diminished but a woman enlarged.

"I'm staying," she said.


                              XI.

The Institute was not pleased. The Institute, in fact, was appalled.
They sent messages of increasing urgency, escalating from professional
concern to formal reprimand to threats of credential revocation. Rana
read each one, composed careful replies, and did not change her
decision.

Vasquez stayed for an additional month to help her establish a
permanent research station — a single shelter, well-sealed and
well-supplied, on the edge of the clearing where the hub waited. He
helped her set up long-range communications, medical monitoring
equipment, and the automated data systems that would transmit her
research to the Institute whether they wanted it or not.

On the morning of his departure, they stood at the edge of the landing
field and said goodbye in the manner of scientists: with handshakes,
and promises of data sharing, and the unspoken understanding that what
was actually being exchanged was something larger than professional
courtesy.

"Is it worth it?" Vasquez asked.

Rana considered the question with her full attention. She considered
the career she was abandoning, the institutional standing she was
forfeiting, the human world she was withdrawing from. She considered
the hub, and the filament network, and the forest that was a single
organism, and the partnership that was changing her in ways she was
still learning to measure.

"I am a biologist," she said. "I study symbiosis. Every symbiotic
relationship I've ever documented has involved risk. The organisms
commit to each other before they can know whether the partnership will
sustain them. They cannot run controlled trials. They cannot peer-
review the arrangement. They make contact, and they adapt, and they
either thrive together or fail together, and the only way to find out
which is to stay."

Vasquez smiled. "That's not a scientific answer."

"No," Rana said. "It's a personal one. I think that's the point."

She watched his shuttle lift and dwindle and disappear. Then she walked
back through the forest — through the paired organisms, through the
whispering, vibrating, interconnected world that she was learning to
see — to the clearing where her partner waited.

The filaments reached for her. She reached back.

The forest breathed.

                       ARCHITECTURE OF LIGHT

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The sun on Clariel did not set. It hung at a fixed point in the sky —
not directly overhead but at an angle of approximately thirty-seven
degrees above the eastern horizon, as though the world had been
positioned with deliberate care to ensure that shadows, while
theoretically possible, were in practice so foreshortened and so faint
as to be invisible. The planet's axial tilt was negligible, its
rotation tidally locked to its star, and the hemisphere that faced the
light had been bathed in continuous, unchanging radiance for as long
as anyone could remember, which on Clariel was a very long time indeed.

Architect Martin Hale stepped off the shuttle and into a world without
darkness.

The light was everywhere. Not harsh — Clariel's sun was a gentle K-type
star, cooler and more orange than Sol — but absolute. It filled every
space, touched every surface, lay in every corner and crevice like
water in a basin. There were no shadows under the trees (the
Clarielans grew ornamental groves of translucent, crystalline plants
that the light passed through rather than being blocked by). There
were no shadows under overhangs, because the Clarielans did not build
overhangs. There were no shadows in doorways, because Clarielan doors
were transparent. There were no shadows anywhere, and the absence — the
total, comprehensive, unbroken absence of shadow — struck Hale with
the physical force of a thing he had not known he depended on until it
was taken away.

He stood on the landing field and looked at the city of Auriel, which
was the reason he had come, and he understood immediately that the job
would be harder than anyone had told him.

Auriel was beautiful. It rose from the plain in tiers of translucent
stone and glass, its towers and domes catching the perpetual light and
refracting it into spectra that painted the air with color. The
buildings were all curves and open spaces — no right angles, no recesses,
no enclosed volumes that might trap darkness. The architecture was
designed not to shelter from light but to celebrate it: to catch it,
bend it, multiply it, send it cascading through interior spaces in
chains of brilliance that were, Hale had to admit, genuinely stunning.

It was also, to his eye, completely flat. Not physically — the city had
depth and dimension, height and complexity. But visually, emotionally,
architecturally, it was flat. Without shadow, there was no contrast.
Without contrast, there was no drama. Without drama, there was no — he
searched for the word and found it waiting for him like a tool in a
familiar drawer — no mystery.

The Clarielans had hired him to build them a cathedral.

He was not at all sure they understood what they were asking for.


                              II.

The commission had come through the Interstellar Arts Council, which
funded cultural exchange projects between human and alien civilizations.
The Clarielans — a humanoid species of considerable intelligence and
refinement, who had been in diplomatic contact with humanity for
thirty years — had expressed interest in human religious architecture.
They had seen images of Chartres, of Hagia Sophia, of Notre-Dame.
They had been, their ambassador had said, "moved by the quality of
interior space these structures create." They wanted something similar
for their own world: a building dedicated to their practice of
communal contemplation, a space that would inspire the particular
reverence they felt in the presence of beauty.

Hale was a logical choice for the commission. He was fifty-two, a
practicing architect with a specialty in sacred spaces — churches,
temples, meditation halls. He had designed the Chapel of St. Francis
on Lunar Station 4, the Interfaith Center on Meridian, and the much-
admired Memorial to the Lost at Gagarin Port. He understood the
relationship between space and spirit, between proportion and emotion,
between the way light fell through a window and the way a person felt
when standing in its path.

What he understood, and what the Clarielans did not appear to
understand, was that every one of those buildings depended on shadow.

The Gothic cathedral was not a celebration of light. It was a
negotiation between light and darkness — an argument, conducted in
stone and glass, about the relationship between the two. The soaring
nave was powerful because the side aisles were dim. The rose window
was transcendent because the walls around it were dark. The light
that fell through stained glass was sacred precisely because it fell
into shadow, because it was a gift wrested from darkness, because
the eye that received it had first been immersed in gloom and was
therefore prepared for revelation.

Without shadow, a cathedral was just a big room.

He did not say this to his hosts. Not yet. He was a guest, and he had
been well-trained in the diplomacy of cross-cultural commissions,
which required that you listen for a long time before you spoke, and
that when you spoke, you spoke carefully.

His liaison was a Clarielan named Solenne — rendered in human phonetics
from a name that was actually a musical phrase — who met him at the
landing field with the gracious formality that characterized Clarielan
hospitality. Solenne was tall, slender, with the luminous, translucent
skin that all Clarielans shared — a skin that seemed to glow faintly
from within, as though the perpetual light of their world had been
absorbed and was now being gently radiated back.

"Architect Hale," Solenne said, extending both hands in the Clarielan
greeting. "We are honored by your presence. The Council of Contemplation
is eager to discuss your vision for the Gathering Hall."

"Gathering Hall?"

"Our term for the structure you have been commissioned to design. A
place of gathering, of communal reverence, of — " Solenne paused,
searching for the human word. "Of awe."

"A cathedral," Hale said.

"If that is your word for it, yes."

Hale looked at the city of Auriel, radiant and shadowless, and
wondered how he was going to explain that awe, as he understood it,
required the thing these people did not have.


                              III.

He spent his first week in observation. This was his method on any
commission: before he drew a single line, he lived in the space. He
walked the streets of Auriel, sat in its public gathering places, ate
in its restaurants (the food was excellent, heavy on fruits and grains,
everything bright with color), attended its concerts (the music was
extraordinary, built on complex harmonies that seemed to shimmer the
way the buildings did), and tried to understand the Clarielan
relationship with light.

It was, he came to realize, not a relationship at all. A relationship
implied two parties. The Clarielans did not have a relationship with
light any more than a fish had a relationship with water. Light was
the medium in which they existed. It was not something they noticed,
valued, or celebrated, because it was not something they had ever
experienced the absence of. They did not have a word for "bright"
because they did not have a word for "dark." They did not have a word
for "illuminate" because they did not have a word for "obscure."

Their language, Hale discovered, had over three hundred words for
different qualities of light — variations in color, intensity, angle,
diffusion — but all of these words described states of presence, not
degrees of absence. They could distinguish between the warm amber of
morning (the light shifted slightly in color through their long day,
though it never dimmed) and the cooler silver of the diurnal cycle's
equivalent of evening. They could name the precise quality of light
that passed through their crystalline trees. They could describe the
way light bent around a human body in terms so precise that Hale felt
he was being measured rather than observed.

But they could not conceive of its absence. The concept of darkness
was, to a Clarielan, not frightening or mysterious or poetic. It was
simply incomprehensible. Like a negative number to an ancient Roman.
Like silence to a species that communicates through vibration. Not
unknown — unthinkable.

This was, Hale realized, a much larger problem than he had anticipated.


                              IV.

"I need to show them shadow," he told his wife, in a comm call that
crossed forty light-years and arrived with a two-week delay that made
conversation impossible and turned every exchange into a pair of
monologues.

"I need to show them what darkness does to a space. Not darkness as
absence — they'd perceive that as failure, as something broken. But
darkness as a positive quality, as a thing with its own beauty and
meaning. Shadow as — " He paused, groping for the formulation. "Shadow
as the thing that makes light visible. The way silence makes music
possible. The way space between words makes language."

He knew she would understand. Catherine was a painter. She understood
negative space, the power of what was left out, the eloquence of
the unmarked canvas. She would know what he meant, even if the
Clarielans did not.

Her reply, when it came two weeks later, was characteristically direct.
"Build it, Martin. Don't explain it. Build it and let them see."

He began to draw.


                              V.

The first designs were cautious. An arch — the simplest shadow-
generating structure, the most fundamental manipulation of light in
the architect's vocabulary. He proposed a series of arches in the
Gathering Hall's interior, rising from floor to ceiling, their curves
creating pockets of reduced light on their inner surfaces.

He presented the designs to the Council of Contemplation, a body of
seven Clarielans who oversaw the project. He had prepared carefully,
using mathematical models to demonstrate how the arches would modulate
the light, creating gradients rather than absolute shadows — a gentle
introduction, he thought, to the concept of controlled darkness.

The Council's response was immediate and visceral.

"This is — wrong," said Councillor Avenne, whose area of expertise
was aesthetic philosophy. The word she used — Hale had been learning
the language — was closer to "injured" than "wrong." As though the
light itself would be harmed.

"The arches would create regions of diminished illumination," said
Councillor Doren, the engineer. "The calculations show this clearly.
There would be spaces where the light does not reach. This is — " He
stopped. The other councillors were looking at him. The concept was
so foreign, so disturbing, that even naming it felt transgressive.

"Architect Hale," Solenne said gently. "We understand that in human
architecture, the modulation of light is a valued technique. But you
must understand: for us, a space where light does not reach is not a
design choice. It is a wound."

Hale nodded. He had expected this.

"May I ask," he said carefully, "what you felt when you saw images of
the human cathedrals? The buildings that inspired this commission?"

Silence. The councillors exchanged glances — a complex, subtle
interchange of expression that Hale was learning to read.

"We felt awe," Avenne said. "We felt — a quality of interior space
that we do not possess. A depth. A — " She struggled. "A resonance.
As though the buildings were saying something that our buildings do
not say."

"What they are saying," Hale said, "is said in shadow."

Another silence. Longer this time.

"Show us," Solenne said.


                              VI.

He built a model. Not a digital rendering — a physical model, at
one-tenth scale, constructed from the translucent stone the Clarielans
quarried in the hills outside Auriel. He worked in a studio the Council
provided, spending three weeks on the construction, shaping the stone
with tools borrowed from a Clarielan mason who watched him work with
an expression of fascinated incomprehension.

The model was a single room, approximately the size of a human chapel.
It had walls — opaque walls, which was itself a radical proposition on
Clariel. It had a ceiling, arched, with a single opening at the apex
through which light could enter. And it had, along one wall, a panel
of glass that Hale had commissioned from a Clarielan glassworker: not
transparent glass, but stained glass, colored glass, glass that did
something no Clarielan glass had ever done.

It filtered the light.

He invited the Council to see it. They came — all seven of them, plus
Solenne, plus the mason, plus a small crowd of curious citizens who
had heard that the human architect was building something strange.

Hale opened the door.

Inside the model, the light was different. The opaque walls blocked the
omnidirectional Clarielan radiance and admitted it only through the
ceiling aperture and the stained glass panel. The aperture cast a
column of warm, focused light down the center of the room — a column
with edges, with boundaries, a shape made not of matter but of
illumination. And the stained glass panel transformed the incoming
light into color — deep blues, rich reds, golden ambers — that fell
across the floor in patterns that shifted slowly as the Clarielan
day's subtle color changes modulated the input.

And between the column of light and the colored panels, there were
shadows.

Not absolute darkness. Hale was not that cruel, or that foolish. But
gradients — regions where the light was softer, dimmer, filtered. Regions
where the eye, accustomed to the full brilliance of Clariel's perpetual
day, had to adjust, had to recalibrate, had to — for the first time in
a Clarielan's experience — actively seek the light rather than passively
receive it.

The Council entered the model in silence.

Hale watched them. He watched Avenne stop in the threshold, one hand
raised to her translucent face, her skin flushing with colors he had
not seen before — deep blues and violets that he would later learn were
the Clarielan expression of an emotion for which they had no name,
because they had never experienced it. He watched Doren walk to the
center of the room and stand in the column of light, turning slowly,
looking at the shadows that surrounded him with an expression that
was not horror but wonder — the wonder of a person encountering
something genuinely new, genuinely unprecedented, genuinely outside
the categories of their experience.

He watched Solenne stand before the stained glass panel, where the
colored light fell across her luminous skin and the shadows gathered
in the folds of her garment, and he watched her weep.

Clarielans wept with light. Their tears were bioluminescent — small,
bright drops that traced lines down the cheeks like falling stars.
Solenne stood in the shadow and the colored light and wept, and the
tears on her face were the most beautiful thing Martin Hale had ever
seen in thirty years of designing beautiful spaces.

"What is this?" Avenne whispered.

"Shadow," Hale said. "This is what shadow does."

"It makes the light — "

"Visible. Yes. For the first time. It makes you see what you have
always had."


                              VII.

The cathedral — the Gathering Hall — took two years to build.

It was the most difficult project of Hale's career, and also the most
rewarding, and the distinction between those two experiences was, he
came to understand, the architectural equivalent of the lesson he was
teaching the Clarielans. Difficulty made the reward visible. Struggle
made the achievement luminous. The darkness of the process made the
light of the result meaningful.

The design evolved through dozens of iterations, each one a negotiation
between Hale's vision and the Clarielans' slowly expanding capacity
to tolerate — and then appreciate — and then desire — shadow.

The exterior was Clarielan: translucent stone and glass, rising in the
graceful curves of local tradition, catching and refracting the
perpetual light. From outside, it looked like any other building in
Auriel, perhaps a bit larger, perhaps a bit more elegant. It did not
announce itself. Hale had learned from the Clarielans that true
beauty did not need to declare its presence.

The interior was another world.

The walls were stone — real stone, opaque, quarried from a deposit of
dark basalt that Hale had located in the mountains of the twilight
zone, the narrow band between the lit and unlit hemispheres. The
Clarielans had never built with this stone. They had never had a reason
to. It was, to them, a mineral curiosity — a rock that light could
not pass through, which made it, in their aesthetic tradition, useless.

Hale made it the skin of the sacred.

The interior of the Gathering Hall was enclosed in darkness — not
absolute darkness, never that, but a deep, rich, velvety dimness that
was, for a Clarielan entering from the perpetual brilliance of their
world, a kind of sensory reset. The eyes adjusted. The skin, which
had spent its entire existence absorbing and radiating light, dimmed.
The mind, freed for the first time from the constant stimulus of
omnidirectional illumination, grew quiet.

And then the windows.

Hale had designed eighteen windows, each one a masterwork of stained
glass created in collaboration with Clarielan artisans who had
discovered, to their astonishment, that their expertise in transparent
glass translated directly to the new medium. The windows told no
stories — the Clarielans did not share human religious narratives —
but they sang with color. Deep indigos and sapphires in the lower
registers. Warm ambers and golds in the middle range. At the apex of
the domed ceiling, a single oculus of clear glass through which the
unchanged light of Clariel's sun fell in a perfect column to the
cathedral floor.

The column of light was the building's heart. It fell through the
dimness like a voice through silence, like a single note through the
pause between movements. It was not brighter than the light outside —
it was the same light, the same star, the same unchanged radiance
that the Clarielans had lived in for millennia. But here, surrounded
by darkness, bounded by shadow, framed by absence, it was
transformed. It was no longer the medium. It was the message.

The colored light from the stained glass windows fell across the dark
stone walls in patterns that shifted through the subtle diurnal cycle
— patterns of blue and gold and crimson that moved like slow music,
like tides, like the breathing of a vast and patient organism. Where
the colored light met the column of clear light, they mingled, and
the mingling produced effects that neither Hale nor the artisans had
anticipated: secondary patterns, interference fringes, shimmering
moirés of color that emerged from the interaction of different
wavelengths and that the Clarielans, with their three hundred words
for light, could describe with a precision that Hale could only
approximate.

They came to see it. In ones and twos at first, then in dozens, then
in crowds. They stood in the dimness and they looked at the light and
they wept their bioluminescent tears, and the tears caught the colored
light and carried it down their cheeks, and the effect — dozens of
Clarielans weeping light in a cathedral of shadow — was a thing that
Hale would carry with him for the rest of his life.

They were seeing light for the first time. Not the light itself — they
had always had the light, would always have it, could not conceive of
its absence. But they were seeing it as a thing, as a presence, as a
quality rather than a condition. Shadow had given them a frame, and
the frame had given the light meaning.


                              VIII.

On the day of the Gathering Hall's dedication, the Council of
Contemplation asked Hale to speak.

He stood at the edge of the light column, in the gentle shadow of the
nave, and looked out at an audience of several hundred Clarielans whose
luminous faces reflected the colored light from the windows in patterns
he had not designed but that the building had produced, because
architecture, like all art, generates meanings its creator did not
intend.

"In my tradition," he said, and Solenne translated, "we believe that
beauty requires contrast. That light needs darkness the way music
needs silence, the way language needs the spaces between words. I was
taught that shadow is not the enemy of light but its partner — that
each defines the other, that neither has meaning alone."

He paused. The column of light fell beside him, warm and steady.

"I came here believing I would teach you this. I was wrong. What you
have taught me is something I did not know I needed to learn."

He looked at the windows, at the colored light on the dark stone, at
the weeping, luminous faces of his audience.

"You taught me that a people can live in unbroken light for a thousand
generations and still recognize beauty when they see it — that the
capacity for awe does not require prior experience of darkness, only
the willingness to see what has always been there. You taught me that
shadow is not a prerequisite for wonder. It is one of wonder's
instruments. And you — by your willingness to enter this building, to
stand in the unfamiliar, to weep at the sight of your own light given
shape and meaning — you have shown me that wonder is braver than I
thought."

He stopped, because the next thing he wanted to say was not for an
audience but for himself, and because Martin Hale was not a man who
made speeches. He was a man who made buildings, and the building was
his speech, and it stood around them, dark and luminous and strange
and beautiful, saying everything he could not.

The Clarielans began to sing. It was not planned — it rose spontaneously,
a sound that filled the cathedral like light filling a room, a sound
that the dark stone walls contained and shaped and deepened in ways
that transparent walls never could. It was a hymn to light, which was
the only kind of hymn they knew, but it was being sung in shadow for
the first time in Clarielan history, and the shadow changed it, gave
it weight and depth and an ache of beauty that the singers had never
known their music contained.

Hale stood in the darkness at the edge of the light and listened, and
for the first time in a long career of building sacred spaces, he
felt that he was standing in one.

Outside, the sun of Clariel hung where it had always hung, unchanged,
eternal, pouring its light across a world that had lived in brightness
since before memory. Inside, the shadows held their ground, and the
light fell through colored glass, and the singing filled the dark like
stars filling a sky that no Clarielan had ever seen.

It was enough. It was, Martin Hale thought, more than enough.

It was beautiful.

MEMORANDUM

TO: Ambassador Cedric Montague-Phipps
FROM: Reginald P. Ffoulkes, Protocol Officer (Third Class)
RE: State Reception for Delegation of the K'thri Hegemony
DATE: 14th March, 2167
CLASSIFICATION: Urgent / Confidential

Your Excellency,

I write to confirm that the State Reception for the K'thri delegation
has been scheduled for the evening of 22nd March at the Grand Ballroom
of the Embassy, Meridian Station. Formal dress. Three hundred guests.
A twelve-piece orchestra has been engaged (human repertoire only, as
the K'thri response to Brahms at the November function was, you will
recall, regrettable).

I must, however, bring to Your Excellency's attention several matters
of protocol that require immediate resolution if the evening is to
proceed without the sort of incident that makes the morning dispatches
disagreeable.

First: the question of greeting. The standard human handshake is, as
we have discussed, problematic when applied to a species possessing
six upper limbs. Previous attempts at a modified handshake (the "three-
and-three" compromise proposed by my predecessor) resulted in what
the K'thri interpreted as a challenge to ritual combat. I recommend
instead the mutual bow, which carries no risk of inadvertent limb-
entanglement and which the K'thri Cultural Liaison Officer, Hive-
Commander Zzt'kalen, has indicated would be "acceptable, if somewhat
tepid." I believe "tepid" is, in the K'thri diplomatic lexicon, as
close to enthusiasm as we are likely to obtain.

Second: food. The K'thri dietary requirements have been communicated
to the kitchen staff, and I must report that the head chef, upon
receiving the specifications, tendered his resignation, withdrew his
resignation, consumed a significant quantity of brandy, and ultimately
produced a proposed menu that I believe satisfies the essential
requirements while remaining within the bounds of what human guests
can be expected to witness without distress. The K'thri prefer their
protein live and mobile. After considerable discussion, we have agreed
upon a compromise: the K'thri dishes will be served from a separate
buffet, screened from the main dining area by a decorative partition
of sufficient height to spare the sensibilities of the human guests
while not, I am assured, implying any judgement regarding K'thri
dining customs. The partition has been decorated with motifs from
both cultures — the Union Jack and the K'thri Hegemonic Sigil — though
I confess the sigil appears, to the untrained eye, to be a rendering
of a very large spider, which may not have the reassuring effect
intended.

I await Your Excellency's guidance on these and other matters detailed
in the attached appendix.

Your obedient servant,
R.P. Ffoulkes

Ffoulkes,

Proceed as outlined. The mutual bow is approved. The partition is
approved. The menu is approved, provided the chef remains sober
enough to execute it.

One additional item: the K'thri Ambassador, Hive-Commander Zzt'kalen,
has informed me that the delegation wishes to present a "cultural
offering" during the reception. I was not given details. Handle this.

RE: K'thri "Cultural Offering"
DATE: 15th March, 2167
CLASSIFICATION: Urgent / Increasingly Alarmed

Your Excellency,

I have made inquiries regarding the K'thri cultural offering and
must report that the situation is more complex than anticipated.

The offering is, apparently, a dance.

The K'thri, it transpires, possess a highly developed tradition of
ceremonial dance, performed at diplomatic functions to express — and
I am translating here from the K'thri Cultural Liaison's briefing
document, which was written in a variety of English that I can only
describe as aspirational — "the joyous vibration of inter-hive
solidarity and the ecstatic celebration of mutual non-consumption."

"Mutual non-consumption," I am informed, is the K'thri term for
what we would call "peace." Their diplomatic vocabulary is, one
gathers, shaped by a history somewhat more directly competitive
than our own.

The dance involves all twelve members of the delegation, requires a
performance space of approximately twenty square meters, and is
accompanied by the K'thri ceremonial drum, which is an instrument
roughly the size of a bathtub that produces a sound I am told is
"deeply moving" to K'thri physiology. I have not been able to
determine whether it is equally moving to human physiology, as no
human has previously attended a K'thri ceremonial drum performance.
I have, however, consulted the medical officer, who recommends
earplugs as a precaution.

The dance will last approximately forty-five minutes.

I believe we can accommodate this, provided the orchestra yields the
stage gracefully and the human guests are briefed in advance. However,
there is a complication.

The K'thri Cultural Liaison has requested, as a gesture of reciprocity,
that the human delegation also perform a dance.

I await Your Excellency's instructions with, I confess, some
trepidation.

RE: The Dance Question (cont.)
DATE: 16th March, 2167
CLASSIFICATION: Urgent / Diplomatic Minefield

Your Excellency,

I have attempted to find an alternative to the reciprocal dance and
must report that the task is proving, as the Americans say, a heavy
lift.

The K'thri concept of diplomatic reciprocity is, it appears, rather
more rigid than our own. In K'thri protocol, a cultural offering that
is not reciprocated is not a gift but a dominance display — a
demonstration of one hive's cultural superiority over another. The
K'thri do not, I gather, make this distinction lightly. Their
history includes several wars that began with unreciprocated
ceremonial dances. (I confess that this strikes me as an unlikely
casus belli, but I have been a protocol officer long enough to know
that wars have been started over less.)

I proposed, as alternatives to a dance: a musical performance (rejected;
the K'thri consider instrumental music without bodily movement to be
"incomplete, like eating without digesting"), a poetry reading
(rejected; the K'thri language has no written form, and they consider
the recitation of recorded language to be, approximately, necromancy),
and a toast (rejected; the K'thri do not consume fermented liquids,
regarding fermentation as "a form of biological treachery").

The Liaison Officer was, however, willing to discuss what she termed
"movement forms that, while not constituting a proper dance by K'thri
standards, might be accepted as a sincere attempt at cultural
participation."

I believe the waltz may be our answer. It is dignified, it is
structured, it involves movement without athleticism, and it can be
performed by as few as two persons.

I am aware that Your Excellency stated that no human under your
authority would dance at a diplomatic function. I must respectfully
observe that Your Excellency's authority does not, technically,
extend to the Ambassador's spouse, Mrs. Helena Montague-Phipps, who
I happen to know is an accomplished ballroom dancer.

I await Your Excellency's response, which I anticipate will be
voluble.

RE: Floral Arrangements
DATE: 17th March, 2167

Your Excellency,

A new complication has arisen regarding the table decorations.

The standard floral arrangements ordered for the reception include
terrestrial roses (red and white, in the diplomatic tradition), which
I approved without a second thought. However, the K'thri Liaison
Officer has informed me that the K'thri species possesses an
olfactory system of extreme sensitivity, and that the scent of
certain terrestrial flowers triggers — and I must ask Your Excellency
to prepare himself — an involuntary mating response.

Roses, it appears, are among the offending flora.

I have replaced the roses with orchids, which the Liaison Officer
assures me produce no such effect. I have also removed the lilies
from the powder room, the carnations from the entryway, and the
lavender sachets from the coat check, which a well-meaning junior
aide had placed there in an attempt to create a "welcoming
atmosphere."

The atmosphere, I am determined, will be welcoming without being
amorous.

I must also note that the K'thri delegation has requested permission
to bring their own floral contribution — a plant native to K'thri
Prime that they consider traditional at diplomatic functions. I have
examined images of the plant and can report that it resembles a small
cactus with what appear to be teeth. The Liaison Officer assures me
the teeth are decorative and not functional. I have chosen to accept
this assurance at face value, as the alternative is too dispiriting
to contemplate.

FROM: Dr. Eleanor Vickers, Medical Officer
RE: K'thri Ceremonial Drum — Audiological Concerns
DATE: 18th March, 2167

Ffoulkes,

Further to your inquiry regarding the K'thri ceremonial drum, I have
conducted research and must advise the following.

The K'thri drum produces sound in a frequency range of 15-200 Hz,
with peaks at approximately 40 Hz. At the expected performance
volume, this falls below the threshold for permanent hearing damage
but significantly exceeds the threshold for what I shall delicately
term "visceral sympathetic response." In layman's terms, the bass
frequencies produced by the drum may cause involuntary vibrations in
the human abdominal cavity.

The effect is not dangerous. It is, however, disconcerting, and may
produce reactions in some listeners that would be inappropriate at a
formal function.

I recommend: (a) earplugs for all human guests, distributed discreetly
at the door; (b) a minimum distance of three meters between the drum
and the nearest human listener; and (c) a polite but firm request that
the K'thri performers moderate their volume, if such a request can be
made without giving offense.

Regarding item (c), I defer to your expertise in protocol, while
noting that in my medical opinion, it would be better to risk a
diplomatic incident than to have three hundred guests experiencing
synchronous intestinal distress.

RE: Seating Arrangements
DATE: 19th March, 2167

Your Excellency,

The seating arrangements for the formal dinner portion of the
evening have required, I must report, more revision than any seating
chart in my professional experience, and I once organized a dinner
for three feuding branches of the Martian Colonial Authority at which
every guest refused to sit within visual range of at least two other
guests.

The K'thri do not sit. They perch. Their anatomy includes a set of
rear limbs adapted for gripping elevated surfaces, and they are most
comfortable at a height of approximately 1.5 meters above the floor.
This means that the K'thri delegates, if accommodated according to
their preference, will be dining at a level roughly corresponding to
the heads of the standing human guests.

I have ordered elevated perching platforms to be constructed and
placed at intervals around the dining area, interspersed with
standard human tables. The effect will be somewhat unusual —
picture, if you will, a room in which half the guests are seated at
tables and the other half are stationed on what amount to very
elegant lamp posts — but I believe it achieves the essential goal:
both species comfortable, both species at roughly similar eye levels
(the K'thri being shorter than humans but compensating via elevation),
and both species able to converse across the species divide without
either craning upward or stooping down.

The perching platforms have been upholstered in the Hegemonic
colours (a rather startling combination of orange and violet) and
equipped with small tables suitable for K'thri dining implements,
which I am told resemble surgical instruments and are not to be
commented upon.

RE: Reciprocal Cultural Offering
DATE: 20th March, 2167

Officer Ffoulkes,

Acknowledgement of your communication regarding the human cultural
offering (classified by you as "waltz"). We have reviewed available
documentation regarding this movement form and wish to express the
following observations:

1. The waltz involves the physical interlocking of two human
   organisms in a rotating pattern. This is noted with interest.

2. The waltz appears to involve only two participants. K'thri
   ceremonial dances involve minimum twelve participants. We wish to
   understand: is the small number of participants an indication of
   the relative importance your species places on this cultural form,
   or is it a reflection of the limited number of limbs available
   for interlocking?

3. We observe that the waltz involves sustained physical contact
   between the participants. In K'thri culture, sustained physical
   contact between non-hive-members carries a specific social
   meaning. We wish to confirm: is the waltz a mating display?

4. If the waltz is a mating display, we wish to express our
   deep appreciation for this gesture of intimacy and vulnerability.
   The K'thri delegation will reciprocate in kind.

Please advise.

With vibrations of collegial warmth,
Zzt'kalen

RE: URGENT — The Waltz Has Been Classified as a Mating Display
DATE: 20th March, 2167
CLASSIFICATION: Extremely Urgent / Please Read Immediately

Your Excellency,

We have a situation.

Hive-Commander Zzt'kalen has interpreted the waltz as a mating
display and has expressed the K'thri delegation's intention to
"reciprocate in kind." I do not know what the K'thri mating display
involves, but I have done sufficient research into K'thri biology to
know that I do not wish to find out at a diplomatic reception in
front of three hundred guests.

I am drafting a response to Zzt'kalen clarifying that the waltz is
a social dance and not a mating display. However, I must note that
this clarification is, from a strictly anthropological perspective,
somewhat debatable, as the waltz was in fact considered scandalously
intimate when first introduced in European ballrooms. I intend to
omit this historical context from my response to Zzt'kalen.

I should also note that Mrs. Montague-Phipps, upon being informed of
the situation, laughed so hard that she was unable to speak for
several minutes. She has asked me to assure you that she is prepared
to waltz regardless of the K'thri interpretation, as she considers it
— and I quote — "the funniest thing that has happened to this embassy
since Cedric tried to explain cricket to the Andromedans."

I await Your Excellency's guidance with what I hope you will
recognize as supernatural patience.

RE: Clarification Regarding the Waltz
DATE: 20th March, 2167

Respected Hive-Commander,

Thank you for your observations regarding the waltz. I wish to
offer the following clarifications:

1. The waltz is a social dance, not a mating display. In human
   culture, social dances involve physical contact as an expression
   of communal participation and shared rhythm. The contact is
   formal, structured, and does not carry reproductive implications.

2. The small number of participants reflects the structure of the
   dance form, not its cultural importance. Humans have developed
   many dance forms involving larger groups; the waltz is simply
   the form we judged most suitable for the occasion.

3. We appreciate the K'thri delegation's generous offer to
   reciprocate in kind but respectfully request that the
   reciprocal offering take the form of the ceremonial dance
   already planned, which we eagerly anticipate.

We look forward to the reception as an opportunity for meaningful
cultural exchange between our species.

With warm regards,
R.P. Ffoulkes

RE: Your Clarification
DATE: 21st March, 2167

Officer Ffoulkes,

We accept your clarification regarding the waltz, though we note
with some disappointment that the physical contact does not carry
reproductive implications. K'thri diplomacy is, as you may have
gathered, a more comprehensive undertaking than its human
counterpart.

We shall perform the ceremonial dance as planned.

We have one additional request. During our research into human social
dances, we encountered a form called the "conga line." We understand
this involves sequential interlocking of participants in a
processional pattern. Could this be incorporated into the evening's
programme? We believe it would serve as an effective inter-species
bridge, as it requires only a single point of contact per
participant and accommodates variable limb configurations.

We also understand that the conga line is customarily accompanied by
a vocal expression of enthusiasm. We have been practising.

With anticipatory vibrations,
Zzt'kalen

Your Excellency,

The K'thri delegation has requested the inclusion of a conga line
in tomorrow evening's reception.

I must confess that upon reading this request, I experienced an
emotion that I can only describe as a profound and unexpected
affection for our insectoid guests. They have been researching human
social dances. They have been practising the conga. They want to
form a line with us and process around the ballroom together.

Your Excellency, they are trying so hard.

I recommend approval. The conga line is simple, inclusive, and
carries no risk of misinterpretation as a mating display. It can
accommodate both human and K'thri anatomy without modification. And
if the image of Ambassador Montague-Phipps leading a conga line of
humans and K'thri through the Grand Ballroom should somehow reach
Whitehall, I submit that it would do more for inter-species relations
than twenty years of formal negotiation.

POST-EVENT REPORT

TO: The Permanent Undersecretary of State for Inter-Species Affairs
FROM: R.P. Ffoulkes, Protocol Officer (Third Class)
RE: State Reception for the K'thri Delegation — After-Action Summary
DATE: 23rd March, 2167
CLASSIFICATION: Confidential

Sir,

I have the honour to report that the State Reception for the K'thri
delegation, held on the evening of 22nd March at the Grand Ballroom
of the Embassy, Meridian Station, was a success.

The evening's programme proceeded as follows:

1. Reception and Greetings (19:00-19:30): Guests were received with
   the mutual bow protocol. No incidents. The K'thri delegation
   arrived in full ceremonial regalia, which consists of iridescent
   carapace polish and what I can only describe as very small hats.
   The very small hats were much admired.

2. Formal Dinner (19:30-21:00): The meal was served without incident.
   The decorative partition between the human and K'thri buffets
   functioned as intended. The K'thri perching platforms were well-
   received. Conversation flowed freely across species lines, aided
   by an excellent translation system and by the universal diplomatic
   lubricant of complaints about one's superiors, which appears to
   transcend species boundaries.

3. K'thri Ceremonial Dance (21:00-21:45): The K'thri performance was
   extraordinary. Twelve dancers, moving in synchronized patterns of
   remarkable complexity, accompanied by the ceremonial drum. The
   drum was powerful. Dr. Vickers' precautions proved wise: the
   earplugs were essential, and the three-meter buffer zone prevented
   any incidents of the visceral nature she had predicted. That said,
   the effect was deeply — I do not exaggerate — deeply moving.
   Several human guests were observed to be weeping. The dance
   expressed, in a language of movement and rhythm that required no
   translation, something that I can only describe as joy. The K'thri
   were joyful. They were celebrating the fact of our meeting, the
   improbability of two species finding each other in the vastness
   of space and choosing, against all the odds of biology and history,
   to stand in the same room and eat dinner together. By the end of
   the performance, the audience — human and K'thri alike — was on
   its feet.

4. The Waltz (21:45-22:00): Ambassador and Mrs. Montague-Phipps
   performed a Viennese waltz to Strauss's "The Blue Danube." I
   must report, Sir, that the Ambassador — who had protested the
   enterprise from its inception — danced with a grace and elegance
   that astonished everyone present, most of all himself. Mrs.
   Montague-Phipps, who is in all things magnificent, guided him
   through the more complex turns with a discretion that preserved
   his dignity while ensuring that the performance was, by any
   standard, beautiful. The K'thri delegates watched in rapt
   attention. Hive-Commander Zzt'kalen, I am informed by the
   translation team, whispered to her aide: "Their interlocking is
   exquisite." I have chosen to interpret this as a compliment.

5. The Conga Line (22:00-22:20): I shall not pretend to objectivity.

   The conga line was magnificent.

   It began with Hive-Commander Zzt'kalen placing two of her six
   upper limbs on the shoulders of Ambassador Montague-Phipps (the
   remaining four she held aloft in what I am told is the K'thri
   posture of "uninhibited social enthusiasm"). The Ambassador,
   demonstrating a spirit of cross-cultural adaptability that I had
   not previously suspected him of possessing, placed his hands on
   the thorax of a K'thri cultural attache and began to move.

   Within two minutes, every guest in the ballroom had joined the
   line. Humans and K'thri alternated, linked by hands and limbs
   and the shared understanding that what they were doing was
   absurd and wonderful and necessary. The orchestra, improvising
   heroically, struck up a rhythm that somehow accommodated both
   human and K'thri movement patterns. The K'thri, true to their
   word, had practised the vocal component and contributed a
   spirited, if phonetically approximate, rendition of the
   traditional conga exclamation that echoed through the Grand
   Ballroom with a volume suggesting that K'thri vocal cords are
   substantially more powerful than previously documented.

   The line processed through the ballroom, out into the corridor,
   through the reception hall, past the coat check (the attendant
   joined in), around the fountain in the central atrium, and back
   into the ballroom, where it dissolved into general jubilation.

   Sir, I have served in the diplomatic corps for nineteen years.
   I have organized state dinners, treaty signings, and memorial
   services on four worlds and two space stations. I have never —
   never — witnessed a moment of such uncomplicated, genuine,
   cross-species goodwill as that conga line.

   Two species, Sir. Two species that evolved on different worlds
   under different stars, that share no common biology, no common
   history, no common frame of reference for what constitutes
   beauty or dignity or joy. Two species that could so easily have
   remained strangers, or worse, enemies. And they chose, on a
   Tuesday evening in March, to hold on to each other and dance
   through a ballroom together, and to shout while they did it,
   and to be — for twenty minutes, in defiance of every rational
   argument against the possibility — happy.

   I recommend, Sir, that the conga line be adopted as standard
   protocol for all future inter-species diplomatic functions.

6. Closing Remarks (22:30): Hive-Commander Zzt'kalen and Ambassador
   Montague-Phipps exchanged brief speeches expressing mutual
   appreciation and the hope for continued friendship between their
   species. The K'thri delegation presented their cultural offering:
   the toothed cactus, which was received with admirable composure.
   (The teeth are, I am now satisfied, decorative. It is, I am told,
   a plant of great beauty among the K'thri, valued for its
   resilience and its willingness to thrive in hostile environments,
   which I gather is meant as a metaphor.)

   The Ambassador presented the K'thri delegation with a first
   edition of P.G. Wodehouse's "Right Ho, Jeeves," which
   Zzt'kalen received with evident delight and a request that
   someone teach her to read English, as the translation software's
   rendering of Wodehouse was, she said, "inadequate to the
   wavelengths of humour she could detect in the original."

7. Departure (23:00): The K'thri delegation departed in good order,
   with many expressions of warmth and several promises to write.
   Ambassador Montague-Phipps retired to his quarters and was heard,
   by reliable report, to remark to Mrs. Montague-Phipps that "it
   wasn't half bad, actually."

Summary Assessment: The reception achieved its diplomatic objectives
and significantly strengthened relations between the human and K'thri
delegations. Formal negotiations on the trade agreement are expected
to proceed more smoothly as a result. More importantly — and I hope
the Permanent Undersecretary will forgive a protocol officer for
venturing beyond his remit — the evening demonstrated that diplomacy
is not only a matter of treaties and trade routes. It is also, at
its best, the art of two very different peoples standing in the same
room and discovering, to their mutual surprise and delight, that
they are glad to be there.

The next diplomatic reception has been tentatively scheduled for
June. The K'thri have already inquired about the possibility of
learning the foxtrot.

I shall begin preparations immediately.

Your obedient servant,

Reginald P. Ffoulkes
Protocol Officer (Third Class)

                     THE BOY WHO COUNTED STARS

                         by Danny Kowalski

================================================================================

                               I.

Tommy Okada counted everything.

He counted the steps from his bunk to the mess hall (two hundred and
fourteen). He counted the rivets in the ceiling above his bunk
(eighty-seven). He counted the number of times Chief Engineer Petrova
said "anomalous" in her weekly status reports (the record was eleven,
set during the coolant pump incident of Year Six). He counted his
heartbeats when he couldn't sleep, which was often, because the
generation ship Endeavour hummed at a frequency of 22.4 hertz and
Tommy could feel it in his teeth, and counting was the only thing
that made the humming bearable.

He was twelve years old, and he had been on the Endeavour his entire
life, which was the same as saying he had been on the Endeavour
forever, because twelve years is forever when you're twelve.

His mother, Dr. Yuki Okada, was the ship's chief astronomer. She
spent her days in the observation dome at the top of Deck One,
monitoring the stars that surrounded them — the same stars that had
surrounded them since before Tommy was born, the same stars that would
surround them for another forty years until the Endeavour reached
Kepler-442b, which was their destination, though Tommy had trouble
thinking of a place he had never seen as a destination. A destination
was something you arrived at. Kepler-442b was just a number.

Tommy preferred numbers to destinations. Numbers were honest. They
didn't promise things.

His father, James Okada, had been the ship's life support engineer.
He had died in the coolant pump incident of Year Six — the same
incident that had given Chief Engineer Petrova her fondness for the
word "anomalous." Tommy had been six years old. He remembered his
father as a large, quiet man who smelled like machine oil and who
had taught Tommy to count by tapping rhythms on the bulkhead wall
above Tommy's bunk.

One, two, three. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five.

Tommy still counted on those rhythms sometimes, when the ship hummed
and sleep wouldn't come. It was the closest thing to a lullaby he
had.


                              II.

The stars numbered 4,337.

Tommy knew this because he had counted them.

It had taken him four months — four months of evenings in the
observation dome, lying on his back on the cold metal floor while his
mother worked at her instruments, staring up through the transparent
ceiling at the slow wheel of the galaxy and counting, one by one,
every star visible to the naked eye from the Endeavour's position in
interstellar space.

His mother had told him it was impossible. "The limiting magnitude of
the human eye is about six," she had said, in the patient, precise
voice she used when explaining astronomy, which was different from the
voice she used when telling Tommy to eat his vegetables. "Under ideal
conditions, a healthy young eye can see approximately five thousand
stars from any position in open space. But atmospheric effects — well,
we don't have an atmosphere, so that's not relevant. Optical clarity,
angular resolution, fatigue — "

"I can count them," Tommy had said.

"Tommy — "

"I can count them, Mom."

She had looked at him — really looked, with the careful attention she
usually reserved for variable stars and spectral anomalies — and she
had seen something in his face that made her nod.

"All right," she said. "Count them."

He had. Four months of patient work, gridding the sky into sections the
way his mother gridded survey areas, working through each section
systematically, marking each star on a chart he kept in a notebook that
Chief Engineer Petrova had given him for his birthday. (Petrova was
gruff and rarely smiled, but she had noticed that Tommy liked to write
things down, and she had found a notebook in the supply stores and
wrapped it in a sheet of thermal insulation, which was the most
Petrova gift imaginable and which Tommy treasured.)

4,337 stars. He had counted them all, verified each count three times,
and presented the final tally to his mother with the solemnity of a
scientist presenting a paper.

She had checked his work. She had taken his chart, compared it against
the ship's star catalog, and spent an evening cross-referencing his
visual count against the telescope's automated survey.

"You missed three," she had said.

"No."

"Tommy, the catalog lists 4,340 stars above limiting magnitude at our
current position. You counted 4,337. You missed three."

"I didn't miss them. They're variable stars. They were below limiting
magnitude during my count periods. VX Cephei, Ross 614 B, and the
unnamed red dwarf at catalog position 2847. They fluctuate. I counted
them at their faint phase. If you check the variability data, my count
is correct for the dates of observation."

His mother had been quiet for a long time. Then she had pulled him into
a hug — something she did not do often enough, by Tommy's count — and
held him, and he had felt her breathing against the top of his head,
and he had not counted her breaths because some things were not meant
to be counted.

"4,337," she had said. "Verified."


                              III.

The Endeavour was a good ship. Tommy knew this because he had counted
its systems the way he counted everything else, and the numbers added
up.

The hull was sound: 2,847 hull plates, each inspected on a five-year
cycle, replacement rate running at 0.3 percent per cycle, well within
tolerances. The engines were healthy: fusion output stable at 98.7
percent of design capacity, fuel reserves sufficient for another
sixty-two years at current burn rate, which was more than enough for
the forty remaining. Life support was — since the coolant pump incident
and the subsequent overhaul — reliable: atmosphere at 21 percent oxygen,
78 percent nitrogen, CO2 scrubbing at 99.97 percent efficiency.

The people were more complicated. People didn't hold still long enough
to count properly, and they changed in ways that numbers couldn't
capture. Tommy knew that Mr. Hernandez in hydroponics was sad because
he drank his coffee in the empty corner of the mess hall and stared at
the table where his wife used to sit before she died last year. He
knew that Ensign Patel in navigation was in love with Ensign Chen in
engineering because Patel's route through the ship changed three months
ago to include a daily detour past the engineering section, adding
forty-seven steps to his commute. He knew that Captain Osei was tired
because the captain's morning announcements, which had averaged four
minutes twelve seconds for the first ten years of Tommy's life, now
averaged three minutes forty-one seconds, and the reduction was not
due to increased efficiency but to decreased enthusiasm.

They were all tired. That was the truth about generation ships that
the recruitment brochures didn't mention: the stars outside the
windows didn't change. For forty years — for a whole human life —
the same 4,337 stars hung in the same positions, moving so slowly
relative to the ship's velocity that the change was imperceptible on
any human timescale. The sky was frozen. The universe was frozen.
Only the people inside the ship moved and changed and aged and died,
and the contrast between their small, brief lives and the enormous,
patient stillness outside the windows was the thing that made
generation ships hard. Not the recycled air or the limited food or
the cramped quarters. The stillness.

Tommy understood this. He understood it the way twelve-year-olds
understand things: not abstractly, not philosophically, but in his
body, in the hum of the ship in his teeth, in the weight of the
unchanging sky on his eyes every time he looked up.

But Tommy had the numbers. And the numbers moved, even when the stars
didn't.


                              IV.

The nebula appeared on the long-range sensors on a Tuesday.

Tommy was in the observation dome when his mother saw the readings.
He was lying on his back in his usual spot, not counting — just
looking, which he sometimes did when the counting was done and the
sky was familiar enough to simply be — when his mother made a sound
he had never heard her make before.

It was not a word. It was not an exclamation. It was a small, sharp
intake of breath, the sound a person makes when they turn a corner
and find something unexpected, and Tommy sat up immediately because
his mother was a woman who expected everything. She was an astronomer.
She had spent her career predicting what the sky would do. She did
not get surprised.

"Mom?"

"Tommy, come look at this."

He went to her station. The screen showed a false-color image from
the forward telescope: a vast, luminous cloud of gas and dust,
glowing in blues and greens and deep, smoldering reds, stretching
across the sky ahead of them like a curtain.

"What is it?"

"A nebula. Emission nebula, hydrogen-dominant, approximately six
light-months ahead at our current velocity." Her voice had the careful
precision she used when she was excited and trying not to show it.
"It's not in the catalog. It was below detection threshold until
now — we're close enough for the forward telescope to resolve it."

"Is it dangerous?"

"No. The particle density is extremely low — a few atoms per cubic
centimeter. The ship will pass through it without difficulty. But — "

She stopped. She looked at the screen, and then she looked at Tommy,
and her expression was one he had never seen on her face before. It
was the expression of a person about to give someone a gift.

"Tommy," she said. "When we pass through the nebula and emerge on
the other side, we'll be in a different part of the galaxy. The
interstellar dust between us and many of the stars we can currently
see will be behind us instead of in front of us. The sky will be
different. The star field will change."

Tommy stared at her.

"The stars," he said. "They'll be different stars?"

"Not entirely different. Many will be the same — the bright ones, the
nearby ones. But some will be new. Stars that are currently hidden
behind the nebula, or too dim to see through the intervening dust.
And some of the stars you can see now will be dimmer, or invisible,
because the geometry will have changed."

Tommy looked at the nebula on the screen. Then he looked up, through
the transparent ceiling, at his sky. His 4,337 stars. His counted,
verified, known sky.

"A new sky," he said.

"Yes."

"I'll have to count again."


                              V.

The Endeavour entered the nebula six months later, and the world
turned to color.

Tommy had never seen anything like it. The observation dome, which
had always shown the clean black of interstellar space salted with
the white points of his 4,337 stars, was filled — filled — with
light. Not the hard, precise light of stars, but a soft, diffuse,
all-encompassing glow that came from every direction at once, as
though the ship were moving through the inside of a lamp.

The colors were extraordinary. The nebula's hydrogen emissions
produced a deep, rich red that dominated the spectrum, but there
were veins of blue-green where doubly ionized oxygen glowed, and
pockets of violet where the radiation from a young, hot star
somewhere deep in the cloud excited the gas to incandescence. The
colors shifted and swirled as the Endeavour moved through the cloud
at its patient fraction of light speed, and the effect was — Tommy
searched for the word and could not find one sufficient.

He searched for numbers instead.

"Hydrogen-alpha emission at 656.3 nanometers," his mother said,
standing beside him in the dome, her face bathed in red light. "Oxygen
III at 500.7 nanometers. The blue-green. And — " She adjusted her
instruments. "Helium II at 468.6 nanometers. That's the violet."

"How long will we be inside it?"

"At our current velocity, approximately three weeks."

Three weeks. Three weeks of color. Three weeks of a sky that was
not black and white but alive with wavelengths and emissions, with
the visible evidence of processes that Tommy could name and quantify
— ionization energies, transition probabilities, spontaneous emission
coefficients — and that were, simultaneously and without contradiction,
beautiful beyond anything he had ever seen.

The crew came to the observation dome. Not in shifts, not on schedule —
they simply came, drawn by the light, by the color, by the fact that
after years of unchanging stars, the sky was doing something.

Mr. Hernandez came and stood at the viewport with tears on his cheeks,
and Tommy did not count them. Captain Osei came and stood with her
hands clasped behind her back and her face tilted up, and her morning
announcement the next day ran six minutes and forty-two seconds, the
longest since Year Three. Chief Engineer Petrova came and stood beside
Tommy and said nothing for twenty minutes, which was a Petrova record,
and then she said, "Anomalous," and Tommy understood that she meant
it as the highest compliment she knew.

Ensign Patel and Ensign Chen came together and stood holding hands, and
Tommy noted this with satisfaction, because he had predicted it
seventeen days ago based on convergence patterns in their respective
route modifications, and it was good when the numbers worked out.

For three weeks, the Endeavour sailed through color, and the crew
remembered that the universe was not frozen. The universe was alive.
It was moving. It was burning. It was making light out of the raw
stuff of atoms, and the light was falling on their ship, and they
were inside it.

Tommy counted the colors. He measured wavelengths with his mother's
instruments, recorded emission intensities, charted the nebula's
internal structure with the same patient rigor he had brought to his
star count. He filled fourteen pages of his notebook. He did not skip
a single evening.

But he also — and this was the part that mattered, though he could
not have said why — spent time each night simply lying on his back in
the dome and looking. Not counting. Not measuring. Just looking. The
way his father had taught him to tap rhythms: one, two, three. One,
two, three, four. Not to count the taps but to feel them. To let the
pattern be the point.

The nebula was the most beautiful thing Tommy had ever seen. And it
was, he understood, a gift. Not from anyone — from the universe
itself, from the random distribution of hydrogen and helium and
radiation that had produced this cloud in this place at this time.
A gift that the Endeavour happened to receive because it happened to
be moving through this particular corridor of space at this particular
moment in time.

That was the thing about counting. It taught you that the universe was
not random — that it had structure, pattern, number at every scale.
But it also taught you that structure and pattern were not the same as
purpose. The nebula was not beautiful because someone had made it
beautiful. It was beautiful because it was, and because Tommy was there
to see it.


                              VI.

They emerged on the other side on a Saturday morning.

Tommy was in the dome. He had been in the dome every day for three
weeks, and he would not have missed this for anything — not for an
extra ration of chocolate (the ship's most valuable currency among the
under-fifteen population), not for a personal tour of the engine room
(his second most coveted experience), not for anything.

The nebula thinned. The colors faded — slowly at first, then more
rapidly as the ship's velocity carried it beyond the cloud's densest
regions. The red dimmed to pink, to rose, to a faint blush on the
aft viewport, and then —

Black.

Clean, clear, interstellar black. The familiar void, the familiar
silence, the familiar emptiness that Tommy had known his entire life.

But the stars were different.

He saw it immediately. The pattern had changed. Where Vega had been
a solo point of light, it now had a companion — a star that had been
hidden behind the nebula, now revealed, shining with a steady blue-
white brilliance six degrees to Vega's galactic east. Where the
Pleiades had been a tight cluster of six visible stars, they were now
seven, the seventh member emerging from behind the dust that had
obscured it. The entire western sky — western by the ship's arbitrary
orientation — was different: dimmer in some regions where the nebula
now lay between the ship and background stars, brighter in others
where the reduced intervening dust revealed stars previously invisible.

Tommy's 4,337 stars were gone.

Not literally gone — most of them were still there, still shining in
their familiar positions. But the sky was not the same sky. The
pattern he had memorized, the pattern he had counted and verified and
carried in his mind for four months of careful work — that pattern
was broken. Changed. Made new.

He reached for his notebook.


                              VII.

It took him five months this time. Five months of evenings in the
dome, gridding the new sky, counting the new stars, verifying each
count three times. His mother watched him work and said nothing,
because she understood that this was not an assignment and not a
hobby. It was the thing Tommy needed to do. It was his way of knowing
the world.

He worked through each section with the same systematic patience he
had brought to the first count, but there was a difference this time.
The first count had been an act of conquest — a twelve-year-old's
determination to master the sky, to reduce its vastness to a number
he could hold in his mind. This count was something else. This count
was an act of greeting.

Hello. I see you. You are new.

The new stars had names in the catalog — his mother helped him look
them up — but Tommy gave them his own names, too, written in the
margins of his notebook in the private shorthand that only he could
read. There was "Petrova's Star," a steady red dwarf that reminded
him of the chief engineer: reliable, unwavering, the kind of star
that would never be flashy but would never let you down. There was
"Dad's Star," which was not a single star but a binary pair, two
points of light orbiting each other so closely that they appeared as
one unless you looked carefully, and Tommy always looked carefully.
There was "Nebula's Gift," a brilliant blue giant that had been
completely invisible from the other side of the cloud and that now
blazed in the new sky like a lamp in a window.

He did not name all of them. That would have taken a lifetime, and
Tommy had learned from the nebula that a lifetime's work could be
changed in three weeks. But he named the ones that mattered, the
ones that spoke to him, the ones that he wanted to remember.

On the last evening of his count, his mother came and lay beside him
on the cold floor of the observation dome. She did not speak. She
simply lay there, looking up at the new sky — her sky, too; she was
counting it with instruments, but instruments were not the same —
and breathing, and being present.

"How many?" she asked, after a while.

Tommy looked at his notebook. Looked at the sky. Looked back at his
notebook.

"4,401," he said.

"That's sixty-four more."

"Sixty-four new ones. And twenty-nine of the old ones are gone —
below limiting magnitude from this position. Net gain of thirty-five."

His mother was quiet for a moment.

"Are you sad? About the ones you lost?"

Tommy thought about this carefully, because it was a careful question,
and his mother did not ask careful questions unless she wanted a
careful answer.

"No," he said. "They're not lost. They're still there. I just can't
see them from here. And the new ones — they were always there, too.
I just couldn't see them before."

He paused. The hum of the ship vibrated in his teeth. The new stars
shone through the dome, steady and patient, waiting to be known.

"It's the same sky, Mom. The same galaxy. The same stars. I'm just
seeing it from a different place."

His mother reached over and took his hand. She did not say anything.
She did not need to.

Tommy held her hand and looked at his 4,401 stars — his new, familiar,
beautiful, countable stars — and began, already, to love them.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                            COMMUNION

                      by Father Thomas Aquino

================================================================================

                               I.

Father Luis Navarro, S.J., had been on Thessaly for eleven months when
the Thessalians invited him to eat with them, and what they offered him
broke his heart with joy.

He had not expected joy. He had expected many things from this
assignment — loneliness, certainly, and the particular spiritual
desolation that Jesuit missionaries called "the dark night of deep
space," a phrase borrowed from St. John of the Cross and adapted,
with the Society's characteristic combination of piety and pragmatism,
to the conditions of interstellar travel. He had expected cultural
confusion, linguistic frustration, physical discomfort. He had expected
to spend his two-year posting on Thessaly documenting the religious
practices of the native species in the dry, careful language of the
ethnographic report, producing a document that would be read by
perhaps forty people at the Vatican's Office for Extraterrestrial
Affairs and filed in an archive where it would rest, undisturbed,
until the Church required it for some future theological determination
that Father Navarro would likely not live to see.

He had not expected the Thessalians to know the Eucharist.

Not to know it — that was the wrong word, the human word, and Navarro
had learned during his eleven months on Thessaly that human words fit
Thessalian reality the way a map of one continent fits the coastline
of another. There were correspondences. There were echoes. But the
shapes were different.

The Thessalians did not know the Eucharist. They practiced something
that, viewed from the outside — from the careful, ethnographic,
theologically neutral outside that Navarro had been trained to maintain
— was indistinguishable from it.


                              II.

The Thessalians were a gentle species. This was not a sentimentality
on Navarro's part — he distrusted sentimentality, which was an
occupational hazard of missionaries and which the Jesuit formation had
spent years training out of him. It was an observation. The Thessalians
were gentle in the way that certain trees are strong: not by resisting
the wind but by bending with it, by yielding without breaking, by
absorbing force and returning to their original shape with a patience
that looked, to the casual observer, like passivity.

They were bipedal, roughly humanoid in body plan, with large, dark
eyes adapted to the dim light of their red dwarf sun and skin that
shifted color in response to emotional states — a feature that made
them the most honest species Navarro had ever encountered, as they
could not conceal their feelings any more than a human could conceal
a blush. They lived in small communities of forty to sixty individuals,
clustered around the geothermal springs that were the dominant feature
of Thessaly's landscape, and their social structure was, by human
standards, remarkably egalitarian. They had no apparent hierarchy, no
leaders in the human sense, no system of rank or authority that
Navarro could detect.

They had, however, a priesthood.

The Thessalian priests — Navarro used the word with caution and with
an awareness of its limitations — were distinguished from the general
population by a single trait: they remembered. The Thessalians, as
a species, had limited long-term memory. Their brains excelled at
immediate experience, at sensory processing, at the rich, detailed
perception of the present moment, but they stored past experience
poorly. Events more than a few weeks old faded into a general
impression — a feeling, a mood — but lost their specificity. They
lived, in a sense, in an eternal present.

The priests were different. Through a combination of training, genetic
predisposition, and what Navarro suspected was a neurological mutation
that had been selected for over millennia, the priests could remember.
They held the community's history, its stories, its accumulated wisdom.
They were the archives of a culture that could not write, and their
role was — Navarro recognized it with a shock that he was still
processing eleven months later — sacramental.

They kept the memory. They held it in trust. And on certain occasions —
at gatherings that followed no schedule Navarro could determine but
that seemed to be triggered by a communal need that the Thessalians
sensed through their color-shifting skin, a need that rippled through
the community like a mood — the priests shared the memory.

They shared it by feeding it to each other.


                              III.

The Thessalians produced, in a gland at the base of the throat, a
secretion that Navarro's medical colleague, Dr. Elaine Park, had
analyzed and found to be neurochemically active — a complex compound
that, when ingested, temporarily enhanced the recipient's capacity for
long-term memory formation and retrieval. The effect was brief,
lasting perhaps thirty minutes, but during that window, the recipient
could absorb and retain new memories with the clarity and permanence
that the priests possessed natively.

At the communal gatherings, the priests secreted this compound into
small vessels — cups, Navarro's mind insisted on calling them,
though they were shaped from volcanic clay and bore no resemblance
to any human chalice — and offered them to the members of the
community. Each community member drank, and as the compound took
effect, the priests spoke. They told the stories. They recounted
the history. They shared the memories that only they could hold,
and for thirty precious minutes, the entire community remembered
together.

They remembered their dead. They remembered their births. They
remembered the seasons and the migrations, the storms and the springs,
the moments of joy and grief and wonder that their brains could not
retain unaided. They remembered who they were.

And then the compound wore off, and the memories faded, and the
community returned to its eternal present — but changed, somehow.
Enriched. As though the brief remembering had left a residue, a warmth,
a sense of connection that persisted even after the specific memories
had gone.

Navarro had watched this ceremony seven times during his eleven
months. He had watched from the edge of the gathering, maintaining
the observer's distance his training required, taking notes in the
small leather journal he carried everywhere, documenting the ritual
with ethnographic precision.

He had not participated. He had not been invited. The Thessalians
seemed to understand, without being told, that the human among them
was watching rather than sharing, and they accepted this with their
characteristic gentleness — a gentleness that Navarro recognized,
with the discomfort of a man who prefers not to see his own
reflection, as patience with a guest who was not yet ready.

On the morning of the eleventh month, the community's eldest priest
— a Thessalian whose name, rendered in human phonetics, sounded
approximately like "Selah" — approached Navarro as he sat outside
his shelter making notes.

Selah's skin was a deep, warm amber — the Thessalian color of
invitation. He carried a cup.

"Will you eat with us?" he said, in the simplified trade language
that Navarro had spent months learning.

Navarro looked at the cup. It was small, rough, shaped from the red
clay of the geothermal springs. It contained a pale, luminous liquid
that caught the dim light of Thessaly's sun and held it.

"This is — " he began.

"Memory," Selah said. "We give you our memory. You give us yours.
We remember together."

Navarro's hands trembled. He was aware of this, noted it as he noted
everything, and understood what it meant. It meant that his body knew,
before his theology caught up, what was being offered.

"I must think," he said.

Selah's skin shifted to a soft, patient blue. "Yes," he said. "Think.
We will be here."


                              IV.

Father Luis Navarro, S.J., retreated to his shelter, closed the door,
and knelt on the floor in the posture of prayer that his body had
learned at the age of eighteen and had never forgotten.

He did not pray immediately. He sat with the silence, which was a
technique the Jesuits called "the preparation," and which consisted
of nothing more or less than allowing the mind to become still enough
to hear what God was saying, if God was saying anything, which was
never guaranteed and which the Jesuits, to their credit, were honest
enough to acknowledge.

He thought about the Eucharist.

The Eucharist — the Lord's Supper, the Holy Communion, the sacrament
that was the center of Catholic worship and the mystery that defined
Catholic faith — was the act in which bread and wine were consecrated
and consumed, becoming, through the miracle of transubstantiation,
the body and blood of Christ. It was not a metaphor. It was not a
symbol. It was, for a Catholic, the literal presence of God, offered
to the faithful in the humblest possible form — food and drink, the
most basic human acts of sustenance — so that they might be nourished
not in body but in spirit.

The theology was clear. The Eucharist was unique. It had been
instituted by Christ at the Last Supper, entrusted to the Church as
the means of grace, and it belonged — in its fullness, in its sacramental
reality — to the Christian tradition alone. Other religions had sacred
meals. Other cultures had rituals of communal eating. But the Eucharist
was not merely a sacred meal. It was the intersection of the divine and
the human, the point at which God entered creation through the medium
of bread and wine, and this intersection was singular, unrepeatable,
and specific to the covenant between God and humanity.

This was what Navarro had been taught. This was what he believed.

And now a species on a world sixty light-years from Earth — a species
that had never heard of Christ, that had no concept of incarnation, that
had developed its culture in complete independence from any human
influence — was performing a ritual that shared with the Eucharist
every essential feature.

A community gathered. A priest presided. A substance was offered in a
cup. The substance was consumed. Through the consumption, the community
was united — not in physical nourishment but in something deeper,
something that the Thessalians called "memory" and that Navarro, kneeling
on the floor of his shelter, was struggling not to call "grace."

The substance was shared. Through the sharing, the individual was
connected to the community, and the community was connected to its
history, and the history was connected to the deepest truth the
Thessalians knew: that they were not alone. That their experience was
not isolated. That the joys and griefs of the living were continuous
with the joys and griefs of the dead, and that this continuity was
sacred.

Take. Eat. This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in
remembrance of me.

Navarro pressed his forehead against the floor and breathed.


                              V.

He had been trained for this. The Jesuits trained for everything —
it was their defining characteristic, the thing that distinguished
them from other religious orders. They were the intellectuals, the
explorers, the ones who went to the edges and looked over, and they
trained their members to look without flinching. Ignatius of Loyola
had designed the Spiritual Exercises precisely for moments like this:
moments when the mind encountered something that could not be
accommodated within existing categories, and the temptation was either
to reject the encounter or to abandon the categories.

Navarro did neither. He sat with the tension.

The tension was this: if the Thessalian communion was a genuine
sacrament — if it truly mediated between the community and some
transcendent reality, if it truly effected the transformation it
appeared to effect — then the uniqueness of the Christian Eucharist
was, at minimum, qualified. The Eucharist might still be singular in
its Christological content, in its specific connection to the person
and sacrifice of Jesus Christ, but it was not singular in its form.
The form — the gathering, the priest, the cup, the sharing, the
transformation — was, it appeared, universal. Or at least not unique
to Earth.

This could mean several things.

It could mean that the Thessalian ritual was a coincidence — a
convergent evolution of practice, analogous to the way different
species independently evolve wings or eyes. Gathering, sharing food,
establishing communal bonds through ritualized eating — these were
adaptive behaviors that any social species might develop. The
resemblance to the Eucharist was superficial, a projection of
Navarro's own categories onto an alien phenomenon.

This was the safe interpretation. The ethnographic interpretation.
The interpretation his report to the Vatican would be expected to
favor.

It could also mean that the Thessalian ritual pointed to something
real — that the impulse to commune, to share a sacred substance, to
be united through consumption, was not merely adaptive but reflective
of a genuine feature of the universe. That the structure of reality
included, at some fundamental level, a communion impulse — a tendency
toward sharing, toward union, toward the breaking of isolation
through the medium of the physical — and that this impulse manifested
wherever intelligent life arose, because it was not invented but
discovered.

This was the dangerous interpretation. The theological interpretation.
The interpretation that would either expand his faith or destroy it.

Navarro knelt on the floor and asked God to help him see.

God, characteristically, did not answer in words. God answered, as
God always did in Navarro's experience, in the slow, painful
rearrangement of the furniture of the mind, which was the Jesuit way
of describing what less disciplined traditions called "inspiration"
and what Navarro, with the bluntness of a man who had spent twenty
years in prayer, called "being shown."


                              VI.

What he was shown, over the course of three days of prayer and
reflection and the kind of intellectual struggle that left him
physically exhausted, was this:

The Eucharist was not diminished by the Thessalian communion. It was
enlarged.

If the communion impulse was universal — if species that had never
heard of Christ, never encountered human religion, never received
any revelation from the God of Abraham, nevertheless arrived
independently at the practice of sacred sharing — then this did not
mean that the Christian Eucharist was one version of a common
practice. It meant that the common practice was a reflection of
something the Christian Eucharist had named.

Grace.

The Thessalians did not know the word. They did not know the concept.
They had no theology to explain what happened when they drank from
the cup and remembered together. But what happened — the union, the
transcendence of individual isolation, the connection to something
larger and older and more enduring than any single life — was grace.
It was the same grace that flowed through the Eucharist. Not the
same sacrament — Navarro was a Catholic, and he was not prepared to
abandon the specificity of the Christian mystery. But the same grace.
The same underlying reality. The same God, if God was what Navarro
believed God to be: not the God of one species, one planet, one
covenant, but the God of the universe, whose grace was poured out
wherever intelligent life gathered and reached for something beyond
itself.

This was not, Navarro recognized, orthodox theology. The Vatican's
Office for Extraterrestrial Affairs had issued three papal encyclicals
on the subject of alien religious practice, and all three maintained
the position that the Christian sacraments were unique to the human-
divine covenant and could not be extended to non-human species without
explicit magisterial authority. Navarro was not in a position to
challenge this teaching. He was a priest, not a theologian, and his
obedience was to the Church.

But his experience was his own. And his experience — kneeling on the
floor of a shelter on a world sixty light-years from Rome, surrounded
by a species that communed as he communed, that shared as he shared,
that reached for transcendence through the humble medium of eating
and drinking together — his experience told him that God was larger
than the categories the Church had built to contain Him.

This was not a crisis of faith. Navarro had weathered crises of faith
before — every Jesuit did, it was part of the formation, part of the
training, part of the process by which the Society produced priests
capable of standing at the edges of knowledge without falling off.
This was something different. This was an expansion of faith. A moment
in which the container grew to accommodate a larger content, and the
growth was painful, as all growth is painful, and also — also —
luminous.

He rose from the floor. He washed his face. He went to find Selah.


                              VII.

The gathering was held at dusk — the long, slow dusk of Thessaly's
red sun, which took hours to deepen from the pale rose of day to the
deep crimson of night. The community assembled at the central spring,
where the warm water rose from the volcanic stone and pooled in
basins that generations of Thessalians had shaped and smoothed with
their hands.

Navarro stood at the edge and watched the community gather. Forty-
three individuals — he had counted them, not with Tommy Okada's
mathematical precision but with a priest's pastoral instinct, the
habit of knowing your flock. They moved with the unhurried grace of
a people for whom the present was the only tense, settling around the
spring in a loose circle, their skin shifting through shades of
amber and rose and soft violet as the emotional register of the
gathering found its pitch.

Selah stood at the center. He was old — the oldest Thessalian Navarro
had encountered — and his skin had lost some of its chromatic range,
settling into a default state of warm, steady gold that Navarro had
come to associate with wisdom, though he acknowledged that this
association might be projection. Selah held the cup in both hands.
The liquid inside glowed faintly in the deepening light.

The gathering fell silent. Not the silence of anticipation — the
Thessalians did not anticipate, because anticipation required a concept
of future that their relationship with time made foreign. It was the
silence of attention. The silence of a community turning, collectively,
toward a single point.

Selah spoke. He spoke in the Thessalian language, which Navarro
understood imperfectly but which he had learned well enough to follow
the cadence and catch the essential meanings. Selah spoke of what had
been: the storms of the previous season, the births, the death of an
elder whose name Navarro recognized, the arrival of the human visitor
who had watched and waited and not yet eaten.

The community's skin rippled with color at each memory — grief for the
death, pale blue; joy for the births, warm gold; curiosity about the
human, shifting green. They were feeling the memories as Selah spoke
them, experiencing the past as present emotion, and Navarro understood
that this was the preparation — the Thessalian equivalent of the
Liturgy of the Word, the readings and prayers that preceded the
Eucharist and prepared the congregation for the sacrament.

Selah held the cup forward.

The first Thessalian approached, drank, returned to the circle. The
second. The third. One by one, the community received the cup, and
as the compound took effect, their skin blazed with color — deep,
vivid, complex patterns that Navarro had never seen before, patterns
that he understood were the visible expression of memories flooding
back, of connections being restored, of individual isolation giving
way to communal remembering.

They were being made whole. Briefly, imperfectly, temporarily — but
whole.

Selah turned to Navarro.

The cup was offered. The amber liquid caught the light of the dying
sun. The community waited, their skin shimmering with the colors of
expectation, which Navarro could see even though he had been told
they could not anticipate. Perhaps they were learning. Perhaps he
was teaching them something, by his presence, by his waiting. The
concept of something yet to come.

Navarro took the cup.

He did not hesitate. He had spent three days in prayer, and the
prayer had given him, if not certainty, then the courage that operates
in the absence of certainty, which was the only kind of courage worth
having.

He raised the cup. He closed his eyes.

"Lord," he whispered, in Latin, because some prayers could only be
said in the language they were first learned in, "I am not worthy
to receive you, but only say the word and my soul shall be healed."

He drank.


                              VIII.

The compound tasted like nothing he could name. It was warm, faintly
sweet, with an undertaste of mineral complexity that reminded him of
spring water from volcanic rock. It went down smoothly, and for a
moment — a long, suspended moment — nothing happened.

Then the memories came.

Not his memories. The community's memories. Selah's memories, shared
through the compound, transmitted through whatever neurochemical
mechanism Dr. Park would one day catalog and classify and publish in
a journal that would be read by biologists who would understand the
chemistry and miss the meaning.

Navarro remembered the death of the elder — not as information but
as grief, as the specific, textured, irreplaceable grief of a
community losing a member it loved. He remembered the births — the
astonishment, the tenderness, the fierce and helpless protectiveness
that accompanied new life. He remembered storms that he had not
witnessed and seasons that had passed before his arrival and moments
of quiet beauty — a sunrise, a song, a child's first steps — that
the Thessalians had experienced and lost and were now, through the
communion, experiencing again.

And he remembered something else. Something that was not a specific
memory but a quality of experience — a warmth, a connectedness, a
sense of being held within something larger than himself, something
vast and gentle and enduring. A presence.

He opened his eyes. The community was looking at him, their skin
blazing with colors he had never seen, and he realized that his own
face was wet with tears, and that the tears were not grief but
recognition.

He knew this feeling. He had felt it before — in the Eucharist, in
the silence of the chapel, in the moments of prayer when the words
fell away and what remained was not language or thought but presence.
The sense of God. The sense of being known, and held, and loved, by
something that did not have a name in any language but that every
language reached toward.

The Thessalians felt it, too. They felt it in their way, through
their communion, through their cups and their compound and their
chromatic skins. They did not call it God. They did not call it
anything. They experienced it, directly and without mediation, as
the ground of their shared existence — the thing that made them a
community rather than a collection of individuals, the thing that
made memory sacred rather than merely useful.

Navarro stood in the circle and wept, and his weeping was prayer, and
the prayer was gratitude, and the gratitude was this:

Thank you. Thank you for showing me that You are here, too. That
wherever intelligent life gathers and shares and reaches beyond
itself, You are there. That the table is longer than I knew. That
the chalice is wider. That the communion is not mine to limit.

Selah's skin blazed gold. He placed a hand — gentle, warm, heavy
with age — on Navarro's shoulder, and Navarro felt, through the
contact and the compound and the trembling expansion of his faith,
that Selah understood. Not the theology. Not the doctrine. Not the
two thousand years of argument and schism and reform that had
produced the Catholic understanding of the Eucharist. But the
essential thing. The thing beneath the theology.

We eat together. We remember. We are not alone.

The communion of saints.

The communion of everything.


                              IX.

The compound wore off after thirty-two minutes. Navarro timed it,
because he was a Jesuit and data was a form of devotion. The memories
faded — the specific, vivid, borrowed memories of the Thessalian
community — but the warmth remained. The presence remained. The sense
of connection, of belonging, of having been taken into something larger
than himself and returned gently to his own boundaries, remained.

This, too, was familiar. It was what he felt after Mass, after the
Eucharist, after the bread and wine had been consumed and the
congregation had dispersed and he was alone again in the sacristy,
taking off his vestments, returning to the ordinary world. The
sacrament ended, but the grace persisted. The memory of communion
lasted longer than the communion itself.

He sat beside the spring as the community dispersed, their skins
fading to the gentle pastels of contentment. Selah sat beside him.
They did not speak for a long time.

"Your people," Selah said finally. "They eat together, too?"

"Yes."

"What do you remember?"

Navarro was quiet. The question was larger than Selah knew — larger,
perhaps, than Navarro could answer in a trade language of three
hundred words. But he tried.

"We remember a man," he said. "A man who loved us. Who gave himself
for us. Who asked us to eat together so that we would not forget."

Selah's skin warmed to gold. "That is a good thing to remember."

"Yes."

"And when you eat — do you feel what we feel? The — " Selah paused,
his skin flickering through colors for which Navarro had no names.
"The not-alone?"

Navarro felt his eyes fill again.

"Yes," he said. "We feel the not-alone."

Selah nodded. He did not smile — Thessalians did not smile; their
expressions of warmth were chromatic rather than muscular — but his
skin glowed with a depth and richness that Navarro understood,
without needing to be told, was love.

"Good," Selah said. "Then we are the same."

Navarro sat beside the spring and watched Thessaly's red sun hover
at the horizon, painting the sky in shades of crimson and amber, and
he thought about the table of the Lord, which he had always imagined
as a table in Jerusalem, in an upper room, with thirteen places set.

He imagined it longer now. He imagined it stretching out through
space, from world to world, from species to species, an endless table
set with cups of every shape and substance, bread and wine and
luminous alien compounds, and around it, seated in every posture of
every body plan the universe had produced, the communicants. All of
them. Everyone who had ever gathered and shared and reached and
remembered.

The table of the Lord was the universe itself.

He bowed his head and gave thanks.

================================================================================

                   TEN THOUSAND YEARS OF BUILDING

                        by Cordell Beaumont

================================================================================

                               I.

Marcus Cole had seen the beautiful places of the galaxy — the
amethyst caverns of Procyon IV, where crystalline formations grew
in darkness for a million years and sang when touched; the
aerial gardens of Zephyria, where flowering vines wove themselves
into structures of heartbreaking delicacy across canyons a thousand
meters deep; the bioluminescent oceans of Thetis, where every wave
broke in cascades of living light. He had stood at the edge of the
Valerian Rift and watched the nebula burn in colors for which no human
language had ever needed names. He had crossed the Dust Marches of
Khemsin, where the windblown sands arranged themselves into patterns
of such geometric purity that mathematicians wept.

He was, by profession and temperament, a traveler — the kind of man
the Survey Service called a "first-looker," someone sent ahead to
assess newly contacted worlds before the diplomats and the trade
delegations arrived. He was good at the job. He had a gift for seeing,
for absorbing the essential character of a place quickly and accurately,
for rendering his impressions in the careful, evocative prose of the
Survey report that would determine how the galaxy understood each new
world it encountered.

He had seen beautiful places. He had described them. He had never been
lost for words.

He stood at the edge of the plateau on Arkhon, looking down at the
city of Endelesse, and he was lost for words.


                              II.

The city began at the river and climbed the hills on both sides in a
slow, magnificent cascade of stone and glass and metal and materials
for which Cole had no names, rising and spreading and unfolding like
a flower that had been opening for ten thousand years and was not yet
half-bloomed.

He tried to take it in and could not. The eye could not hold it. It
was too large, too complex, too layered with ten millennia of
accumulated intention. Every meter of the city was built — every
surface, every structure, every pathway and plaza and bridge and
tower was the product of a conscious decision, a designed thing —
and yet the accumulation of ten thousand years of design had produced
something that felt not designed but organic, not planned but grown,
as though the city were not a thing the Arkhoni had made but a thing
that was making itself, slowly and patiently, through the medium of
their labor and their love.

Cole activated his recorder and said nothing. The recorder ran for
three minutes of silence before he found his voice.

"Endelesse," he said. "The sole city of Arkhon. Population estimated
at — " He checked his briefing notes. "Fourteen million. Construction
began approximately ten thousand standard years ago. Construction
continues."

He paused. The inadequacy of this summary was so profound that it
almost qualified as a lie.

"Begin again," he told the recorder. "Begin differently."


                              III.

The Arkhoni were, by any reckoning, a remarkable species. They lived
long — three hundred standard years, on average, in conditions of good
health — and they lived slowly, with a patience that was not the
patience of resignation but the patience of purpose. A single Arkhoni
might spend a century on a single work: a carving, a mosaic, a
mathematical proof, a piece of music that unfolded over decades and
was heard in its entirety only once. They did not hurry. They did not,
as far as Cole could determine from his preliminary research, have a
word for "hurry." They had seventeen words for "patience" and twenty-
three for "care" and a single, untranslatable word — something like
"neshu" — that Cole's linguistic guide suggested meant "the joy of
work that will be completed by someone else."

Neshu. The joy of working for the future you will not see.

This concept was the foundation of Endelesse. The city had been
begun ten thousand years ago by a generation of Arkhoni who knew
they would not see it finished. It would be continued by their
children, and their children's children, and every generation
thereafter, each one adding to the city according to the aesthetic
principles and architectural philosophies of their time, each one
building upon and in dialogue with everything that had come before.

The city was not a city in the human sense. It was an argument.

A ten-thousand-year-long philosophical argument, conducted in stone
and glass and light, about what beauty was and what it meant and
how it should be made manifest in the world.


                              IV.

Cole descended from the plateau on a pathway that had been carved
into the hillside three thousand years ago by artisans whose names
were still known and whose work — the smoothness of the stone, the
gentle curve of each step, the way the pathway's width expanded at
each turning to create small platforms from which the city could be
viewed at different angles — was still, after three millennia of foot
traffic and weather, perfect.

He ran his hand along the wall of the pathway and felt, beneath his
fingers, a texture that was not mere stone but carved stone — a relief
so shallow that it was invisible to the eye but perceptible to the
touch. He stopped and looked closely. The relief depicted — as nearly
as he could determine, squinting in the amber light of Arkhon's sun
— a procession of figures, Arkhoni, walking along a path that
mirrored the very path he was descending. They were carrying tools.
They were going to work.

Three thousand years ago, an artisan had carved, into the wall of this
pathway, a portrait of the artisans who had built this pathway. A
record. A memory. A love letter from the builders to the built.

Cole felt something move in his chest that he recognized, with the
professional detachment of a man who had trained himself to catalog
his own reactions, as the beginning of being overwhelmed. He took a
breath, consulted his training, and decided to be overwhelmed anyway.
Some places earned it.


                              V.

The lower city — the oldest quarter, the foundation upon which ten
thousand years of building had been laid — was, as Cole's guide
Arathe explained, considered sacred. Not sacred in the religious
sense — the Arkhoni had no religion that Cole could identify, no gods,
no temples, no priesthood. Sacred in the sense of "set apart," of
"honored," of "not to be altered." The lower city was the original
statement, the first sentence of the argument, and it was preserved
in its original form as the starting point against which all
subsequent additions were measured.

It was beautiful. Not beautiful in the way that Cole expected — not
overwhelming or spectacular, not the kind of beauty that stunned the
eye and silenced the mind. It was modest. It was humble. It was a
few hundred structures of simple stone, well-proportioned, carefully
made, arranged around a central plaza where a spring emerged from the
rock and pooled in a basin that was the oldest made thing in the city.

The basin was a simple circle of stone, worn smooth by ten thousand
years of hands dipping into the water. It had no ornament. It had
no inscription. It was a basin, and the water was clean, and the
spring flowed as it had flowed before the first Arkhoni lifted the
first stone and laid it in the first course of the first wall, and
the simplicity of this — water, stone, the beginning of everything —
was so perfect that Cole stood before it for a long time and said
nothing.

"The First Builders," Arathe said, standing beside him. She was tall,
even for an Arkhoni, with the deep amber skin and large, thoughtful
eyes of her species. She had been assigned as his guide by the city's
Council of Stewards, and she possessed the particular gift that good
guides always possessed: the ability to be present without intruding.

"They began here," she said. "Ten thousand years ago. They laid the
first stones. They did not know what the city would become. They knew
only that they wanted to build something worthy of care."

"They succeeded," Cole said.

Arathe smiled. It was a slow, wide smile that used her entire face.
"They began to succeed," she said. "The success is not finished."


                              VI.

He spent a week in the lower city before he felt prepared to move
upward. This was not a research strategy; it was an emotional
necessity. The city demanded to be understood chronologically — layer
by layer, era by era, the way one reads a book from the first page —
and Cole's instinct as a first-looker told him that rushing through
the early chapters would cripple his understanding of the later ones.

The lower city's architecture was stone: heavy, solid, rooted. The
First Builders had worked with what the land gave them — basalt from
the river gorge, limestone from the plateau, sandstone from the
eastern badlands — and they had shaped it with a skill that was
extraordinary in its restraint. No excess. No ornament. Every
structural element served a purpose, and the purpose was sufficient.
Walls bore loads. Roofs shed rain. Doors admitted light. The beauty
of the lower city was the beauty of necessity perfected: each
building was exactly what it needed to be, and no more, and the
exactness was its elegance.

The second millennium's additions introduced curves. Where the First
Builders had worked in straight lines and right angles, the Second
Era architects — responding, Arathe explained, to a philosophical
movement that rejected linearity as "an imposition on the natural
flow of space" — built in arcs and spirals. Walls curved. Roofs
domed. Doorways became arches. The effect was a softening of the
lower city's severity, a dialogue between the straight and the curved
in which neither dominated and both were enriched.

Cole walked through the transition zone — the boundary between the
first and second millennia's work — and felt, physically, the shift
in aesthetic. The straight walls gave way to curves as gradually as
a river bends, and the transition itself was the architecture's
argument: that change was not rupture but evolution, that the new
did not replace the old but grew from it, the way a branch grows
from a trunk.

The third millennium introduced glass. Not transparent glass — the
Arkhoni had no need for windows in the human sense, as their
climate was mild and their relationship with the outdoors was more
fluid than humanity's — but colored glass, glass as art, glass as
a medium for capturing and transforming light. The third-era
buildings were pierced with panels of glass in deep blues and
greens and ambers that admitted the light of Arkhon's sun in
filtered, colored streams, painting the interiors with a warmth
that the stone alone could not produce.

Cole thought of Martin Hale and his cathedral on Clariel. The
Arkhoni had arrived at the same insight three thousand years before
any human had: that light, transformed by the medium through which
it passed, became more than illumination. It became language.

The fourth millennium introduced metal. The fifth, a material Arathe
called "sunite" — a composite of mineral and organic matter that the
Arkhoni had developed through centuries of experimentation and that
possessed properties Cole found nearly miraculous: it was as strong
as steel, as light as wood, and it changed color in response to
temperature, so that the fourth-era buildings shifted from cool
blues in the morning to warm golds in the afternoon, the
architecture itself breathing with the rhythm of the day.

The sixth millennium — Cole was climbing now, ascending through the
city's strata like a geologist ascending through rock formations,
each era a layer, each layer a world — introduced the concept of
"responsive architecture." Buildings that moved. Not mechanically,
not through motors or gears, but through the subtle flexion of
materials engineered to respond to wind, temperature, and the
weight of the inhabitants. Walls that breathed. Roofs that
tilted to follow the sun. Floors that yielded beneath the foot
like living tissue.

The seventh millennium added music. Structures designed to
capture wind and channel it through tuned chambers, producing
harmonics that Cole could hear from a kilometer away: deep,
sustained tones that rose and fell with the breeze, a symphony
written in architecture and performed by the weather.

The eighth millennium added gardens — not on the ground but in the
buildings themselves, integrated into walls and roofs and floors,
living plants woven into the architectural fabric so seamlessly that
it was impossible to tell where the building ended and the garden
began. The eighth-era quarter smelled of flowers and green growth,
and the scent mixed with the musical tones of the seventh era below,
and the colored light of the third era filtered up through shafts
and stairwells, and Cole understood — standing in the intersection
of five thousand years of accumulated beauty — that this was the
point. This was what the Arkhoni were doing. They were not building
a city. They were building a conversation. Each era spoke to every
other era, answered it, challenged it, harmonized with it. The
city was not a collection of buildings but a single, continuous
work of art, ten thousand years in the making, in which every
generation was both audience and author.


                              VII.

The upper city — the most recent construction, the ninth and tenth
millennia — was where the Arkhoni lived and worked and continued
building. It was also where the city's argument reached its current
state, and where Cole found himself, on his eighth day in Endelesse,
standing on a terrace at the city's highest point and weeping.

He was not ashamed of this. He was a first-looker. He had been trained
to have reactions and to document them honestly, and his honest
reaction to the upper city of Endelesse was tears.

The ninth-era builders had introduced what Arathe called "light-
shaping" — the technology, or art, or discipline (the Arkhoni did
not distinguish between these categories) of manipulating light
itself as a building material. The upper city's structures were, in
part, made of light: focused, shaped, stabilized beams of coherent
illumination that served as walls, arches, bridges, and ornamental
elements, their colors shifting through the spectrum in patterns
programmed by the architect and modulated by the city's collective
aesthetic algorithms — algorithms that had been refined over centuries
to produce effects of such subtlety and beauty that Cole's eye could
perceive them but his vocabulary could not describe them.

The tenth-era builders — the current generation, the Arkhoni who were
alive and working now — were integrating all of it. Stone and glass
and metal and sunite and responsive materials and music and gardens
and light, woven together in structures that combined ten thousand
years of accumulated knowledge and aesthetic principle into a unified
whole that was — Cole searched for the word, the one word that would
capture what he was seeing, and the word that came to him was not from
his professional vocabulary but from somewhere deeper, somewhere the
training did not reach —

Sublime.

The city was sublime. It exceeded the capacity of the mind to
encompass it. It was too large, too beautiful, too dense with
meaning and intention and love. Ten thousand years of love — the
love of builders for their work, the love of each generation for
the generations that preceded it and the generations that would
follow, the love of a species for the act of making something
worthy of the time it took to make it.

And it was not finished. It was not half-finished. The Arkhoni
were still building. Even now, as Cole stood on the terrace and
wept, he could see construction in progress on the city's eastern
edge: scaffolding and cranes and the small figures of workers
moving with the deliberate, unhurried care that characterized
everything the Arkhoni did. They were adding to the argument.
They were writing the next sentence. They would not live to see
how the sentence ended, and they did not need to, because the
sentence was not the point.

The building was the point. The care was the point. The act of
adding something — something considered, something beautiful,
something worthy — to the work of those who came before, in the
faith that those who came after would do the same. Neshu. The
joy of work that would be completed by someone else.


                              VIII.

Cole sat with Arathe on the terrace as the day grew long and
Arkhon's amber sun descended toward its slow, protracted dusk. The
city lay below them, luminous and vast, its ten thousand years of
layered beauty shimmering in the changing light. The musical tones
from the seventh-era quarter drifted up on the breeze. The gardens
of the eighth era scented the air with something sweet and green.
The light-structures of the ninth era began to glow as the natural
light diminished, their colors deepening from the soft pastels of
daytime to the rich jewel tones of evening.

"How does it end?" Cole asked.

Arathe looked at him with her large, steady eyes. "End?"

"The city. The building. When will it be finished?"

Arathe considered the question with the patience of a species for
whom patience was not a virtue but a medium, the element in which
they lived.

"We do not have a word for 'finished,'" she said. "Not as you
mean it. We have a word for 'complete,' which means 'containing
everything it needs at this moment.' The city is always complete.
It is complete now. It was complete a thousand years ago, when it
was less than it is now. It will be complete a thousand years from
now, when it is more."

"But you're still building."

"Yes."

"If the city is already complete, why continue?"

Arathe's slow smile returned. "Because that is what we do," she said.
"We build. Not because the city needs it, but because we need it —
because the act of building is how we understand ourselves. Each
generation looks at what the generations before have made, and
asks: What can we add? What beauty do we see that they did not?
What do we know that they could not have known? And we build our
answer, and the next generation looks at our answer and asks the
same questions, and so the conversation continues."

She gestured at the city below — the vast, luminous, unfinished,
complete, ten-thousand-year-old argument in stone and glass and light.

"The building is how we think," she said. "The city is our mind,
made visible. Every stone is a thought. Every arch is an argument.
Every garden is a feeling. And we are not finished thinking."

Cole looked at the city. He looked at the construction cranes on the
eastern edge, where the next millennium's contribution was beginning
to take shape. He looked at the ancient basin in the lower city,
where the spring still flowed over stones laid by hands ten thousand
years dead. He looked at the whole of it — the whole magnificent,
impossible, patient, unfinished, beautiful whole of it — and he
understood something that his Survey report would not be able to
capture, because some truths were too large for prose and could
only be gestured at, the way a hand gestures toward a horizon.

The Arkhoni had solved the oldest problem in civilization. Not
through philosophy, not through religion, not through politics or
economics or technology. Through architecture. Through building.
They had found a way to make each generation's work meaningful
beyond its own lifespan, to connect the living to the dead and
the dead to the unborn, to create a continuous thread of purpose
and beauty that stretched across ten thousand years and would
stretch, if the Arkhoni endured, across a hundred thousand more.

They had built a city that was a civilization. A civilization that
was a city. The two were the same thing, indistinguishable, each
producing the other in an endless cycle of creation that was, Cole
understood now, the most hopeful thing he had ever seen.

Because it said: we believe in the future. Not abstractly, not as
a philosophical proposition, but concretely, in stone and glass and
light. We believe that someone will come after us, and that what we
build will matter to them, and that what they build will matter to
the ones who come after them. We believe that the work is worth
doing even though we will not see it completed. We believe that
beauty is a reason to endure.

Cole reached for his recorder. He activated it. He cleared his
throat. He began, for the third time, to try to describe Endelesse
— the endless, the unfinished, the most beautiful thing he had ever
seen — and this time the words came, not because they were adequate
but because they were his contribution, his small addition to the
conversation, his stone laid upon the stones that had come before.

"Endelesse," he said. "The sole city of Arkhon. Let me tell you
what I have seen."

And the city glowed below him, and the music rose from its ancient
quarters, and the builders worked on the eastern edge as the sun
went down, and the work continued, as it had continued for ten
thousand years and would continue, God willing and the stars
permitting, for ten thousand more.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

CASSANDRA VOSS spent eleven years as a political analyst at the State
Department before she wrote a word of fiction, and she has spent the
years since demonstrating that the most gripping science fiction does
not require ray guns — only committee rooms, back channels, and people
who fundamentally distrust each other. Her stories for this magazine
have explored interstellar diplomacy with a nuance and complexity that
no other writer in the field can match. She lives in Georgetown, where
her dinner parties are legendary for bringing together SF writers,
foreign correspondents, and mid-level government officials in
combinations that produce either fascinating conversation or
spectacular arguments. "The Mapmaker's Daughter" is her eighth
appearance in these pages, and she describes it as "the most personal
story I've written — it turns out I know something about fathers who
communicate in code."

MARGARET THORNTON holds a master's degree in marine biology from the
University of Washington and has been writing science fiction about
the interconnectedness of living systems since before the word
"ecology" entered common usage. Her work has appeared in every era of
this magazine, growing in scope and power with each decade. She lives
on Orcas Island in the San Juan archipelago, where she is active in
the conservation movement and is known for conscripting visiting
writers into dawn tide pool surveys. "Symbiosis" is her twenty-
seventh story for "Tales," and it is, she says, "the most honest
thing I've ever written, which makes me nervous."

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, with forty-two stories to his name and counting. A former
autoworker, technical writer, and veteran of the Battle of the Bulge,
he has been producing solid, engaging fiction in every sub-genre
science fiction has to offer for over a decade, working every evening
from eight to midnight in a converted bedroom in Dearborn, Michigan.
"Architecture of Light" is a departure from his usual mode — more
contemplative, more philosophical — and we think it is among his
finest work. When asked about the story's genesis, he said: "I was
sitting in church one Sunday and the light came through the window
and I thought, what if you'd never seen that before?"

DOUGLAS PEMBERTON is the magazine's resident humorist, a man who
approaches the future with the attitude of a Wodehouse character
confronting a country house weekend: cheerful bafflement, impeccable
manners, and the quiet certainty that everything will go wrong in
the most entertaining way possible. He is a graduate of Oxford, a
former Royal Navy officer, and the winner of one Hugo Award, for
"The Conquest of Marsfield." He lives in Surrey with his wife
Penelope, three dogs, two cats, a parrot that can recite the opening
of "The War of the Worlds," and a tortoise named Doris. "Entomologist's
Ball" is his twentieth story for "Tales," and he says it was inspired
by attending an embassy reception at which he was placed next to "a
chap from the Swedish delegation who spoke no English and I spoke no
Swedish, and we had the most wonderful evening."

DANNY KOWALSKI grew up in the Polish Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh,
the son of a steelworker, and found his way to the stars through the
public library and the science fiction magazines he bought with nickels
from his paper route. He is a middle school science teacher, a Korean
War veteran, and the writer of some of the most beloved young-
protagonist stories in the magazine's history. His readers grow up
and remember him; this is his legacy and his pride. "The Boy Who
Counted Stars" is his fifteenth story for "Tales," and he says it was
written for "every kid who ever lay on their back and looked up and
wanted to count what they saw."

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO, S.J., is an ordained Jesuit priest who teaches
philosophy and theology at Loyola University in Baltimore and writes
science fiction about the intersection of faith and the unknown. His
stories are thoughtful, measured, and deeply compassionate explorations
of how a faithful person accommodates new knowledge without abandoning
either the knowledge or the faith. He writes slowly, carefully, and
never more than one or two stories a year, each one produced in a small
study overlooking a garden in the Jesuit residence at Loyola.
"Communion" is his fourteenth story for "Tales," and he describes it
as "the story I have been trying to write since I first looked through
a telescope and realized that God was larger than I had imagined."

CORDELL BEAUMONT writes about alien worlds the way a lover writes about
the beloved: with intoxicated attention to every detail, every color,
every scent. Born in New Orleans to a Creole family with roots in the
French colonial period, he is a gourmet cook, an amateur botanist, and
a collector of maps of imaginary places. He writes in a second-floor
study overlooking a courtyard garden that he tends with obsessive care,
and his wife Lisette's Fauvist paintings hang on every wall of their
Faubourg Marigny home. "Ten Thousand Years of Building" is his
sixteenth story for "Tales," and he calls it "a love letter to
everyone who has ever built something beautiful and known they would
not see it finished."

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Editors,

I am writing to say that Issue #57 ruined my week. This is a
compliment. Drummond's "Last Stand at Betelgeuse" kept me up until
three in the morning, and Blackwell's "The Cartography of Scars"
made me weep on the bus to work, which is not a dignified way for
a grown man to start his Tuesday. You warned us it was a war issue.
You did not warn us that it would follow us home.

More like this, please. But also — something to remind us why we read
science fiction in the first place. Something with wonder in it.

                              — Thomas Richter
                                 Milwaukee, Wisconsin

Dear Mr. Richter — Ask and ye shall receive. We hope this issue
provides the antidote you requested.                        — M.S.

---

Dear Mr. Sterling and Miss Foxworth,

I have been reading "Tales" since Issue #1, and I want you to know
that the magazine has only gotten better. The decision to go bimonthly
and increase the page count was the right one. The stories are longer,
deeper, more ambitious. Keep going. Some of us have been here from
the beginning and we're not going anywhere.

Also: more Thornton, please. That woman writes rings around half the
men in this magazine.

                              — Dr. Helen Barrow
                                 Department of Biology
                                 University of California, Berkeley

Dear Dr. Barrow — We agree on all counts. Thornton's "Symbiosis"
in this issue should satisfy, at least temporarily.         — D.F.

---

Dear Editors,

Pemberton's "Diplomatic Pouch" in Issue #57 was the funniest story
you have ever published and I will fight anyone who disagrees. The
scene where the alien ambassador attempts to explain the concept of
"irony" and concludes that it is "a deficiency in human pattern
recognition" had me laughing so hard I spilled my coffee on my cat,
who has not yet forgiven me.

Is it too much to hope for more Pemberton in the near future?

                              — Mrs. Arthur Finch
                                 Bath, England

Dear Mrs. Finch — Please extend our apologies to your cat. Pemberton
returns in this very issue with "Entomologist's Ball," which we
believe may surpass even "Diplomatic Pouch" in the comedy-to-
coffee-spillage ratio.                                      — M.S.

Dear Sterling and Foxworth,

I'm sixteen years old and I've been reading "Tales" for three years.
I want to be a writer when I grow up. Danny Kowalski's stories are
the reason I started reading science fiction, and I think he's the
best writer you publish, even though I know the critics don't agree.
His characters feel real. They feel like me.

Do you have any advice for a young writer?

                              — Michael Kowalczyk
                                 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

Dear Michael — The best advice we can give: read everything, write
every day, and don't let anyone tell you that the stories that move
you aren't important enough. Danny Kowalski would tell you the same.
In fact, we'll make sure he sees your letter. Something tells us
he'll want to write back.                                  — D.F.

---

Dear Editors,

Father Aquino's "Vespers at the Edge" in Issue #70 was the most
profound meditation on faith I have read in any genre, and I say this
as a Presbyterian minister who reads theology for a living. The
scene where the priest celebrates evening prayer at the boundary of
the observable universe — simultaneously the smallest and the largest
act of worship imaginable — will stay with me for the rest of my
life.

I understand that some readers find religious fiction in a science
fiction magazine incongruous. I find it essential. Thank you for
publishing Father Aquino, and thank you for reminding us that faith
and wonder are not enemies.

                              — Rev. James Whitfield
                                 First Presbyterian Church
                                 Lexington, Kentucky

Dear Reverend Whitfield — Father Aquino returns in this issue with
"Communion," which we believe may be his finest work. We share your
conviction that faith and wonder belong together, especially in this
magazine.                                                   — M.S.

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

DUNE by Frank Herbert
(Chilton Books, 1965, $5.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Mr. Herbert has given us a novel of such scope, ambition, and
meticulous world-building that it redefines what science fiction can
be. On the desert planet of Arrakis, where water is the most precious
substance and the giant sandworms produce the spice that makes
interstellar travel possible, the young Paul Atreides confronts a
destiny that encompasses ecological science, political intrigue,
religious prophecy, and the terrible burden of prescience.

The world-building is staggering. Herbert has created a civilization —
no, a universe — of such density and coherence that one feels not so
much that one is reading a novel as exploring a world that existed
before the book was opened and will continue after it is closed. The
ecology of Arrakis alone would sustain a lesser novel; Herbert layers
upon it a political structure of Byzantine complexity, a religious
tradition of unsettling plausibility, and a meditation on the nature
of power and prophecy that resonates with uncomfortable force.

It is not a perfect book. Herbert's prose is sometimes dense to the
point of opacity, and his characters occasionally function more as
vessels for ideas than as fully realized human beings. But these are
minor complaints against a work of such extraordinary ambition and
achievement. "Dune" is the most important science fiction novel
published this decade, and possibly this quarter-century. Essential
reading. Highest recommendation.

THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH by Philip K. Dick
(Doubleday, 1965, $4.50)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Dick is the most unsettling writer in science fiction, and this
may be his most unsettling book. In a future where colonists on
Mars escape their miserable existence through a drug-fueled
shared hallucination, the arrival of a rival drug — brought back
from the Proxima system by the mysterious Palmer Eldritch — threatens
to dissolve the boundaries between reality and illusion altogether.

What follows is a nightmare of ontological uncertainty that makes
Kafka look like a realist. Dick's genius lies not in his plotting,
which is characteristically tangled, nor in his prose, which is
workmanlike, but in his ability to make the reader feel the
vertigo of a world where reality itself has become unreliable. By
the novel's end, the reader is not sure what happened, what was
real, or whether the question even applies — and this uncertainty
is not a flaw but the point.

It is, let us be clear, a profoundly disturbing reading experience.
It is also a brilliant one. Recommended, with the caveat that the
reader should perhaps avoid consuming it in a single sitting, as
the cumulative effect on one's sense of reality is not trivial.

THE CRYSTAL WORLD by J.G. Ballard
(Jonathan Cape, 1966 — advance review copy)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Ballard continues his series of elemental catastrophe novels
with this tale of a mysterious crystallization process spreading
through an African jungle, transforming living matter into frozen,
jewel-like sculptures of terrible beauty. Where "The Drowned World"
gave us flood and "The Burning World" gave us drought, "The Crystal
World" gives us a catastrophe that is, paradoxically, gorgeous — a
transformation that destroys life while creating something
achingly beautiful in its place.

Ballard is not, and has never been, a writer of conventional science
fiction. He is a prose poet of entropy, a painter of apocalypse, and
his interest lies not in the mechanism of catastrophe but in the
human response to it — specifically, the disturbing possibility that
catastrophe might be welcomed, even desired, as a release from the
tedium of ordinary existence. This is subversive, deeply strange,
and not for every reader. But for those willing to follow Ballard
into his crystalline jungle, the rewards are considerable.
Recommended.
