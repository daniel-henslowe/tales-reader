TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

I owe you a confession.

Even I had trouble sleeping after editing this one.

Our third annual October issue has become, I am told by the letters
that flood our offices each autumn, something of a tradition. Readers
plan for it. They set aside their Halloween evening to read it by
lamplight. They dare their friends to finish it in one sitting. This
pleases me enormously, and it terrifies me a little, because each year
the challenge grows: how do we make it darker? How do we find new
corners of the unknown to illuminate — or, more properly, to shroud in
deeper shadow?

This year, I believe we have succeeded beyond what is strictly
comfortable.

Harrison Blackwood opens our pages with "The Thing in the Walls of the
World," a story that began as a submission I almost returned with a note
reading simply: "Harrison, what have you done?" It is, I believe, the
most frightening story we have ever published, and its terrors are not
the cheap shivers of a carnival spook house but the genuine, bone-deep
dread that comes from contemplating the nature of the universe we
inhabit. I will say only this: after reading it, you may find yourself
reluctant to look at the night sky.

Lucian Marsh follows with "The Preservation Society," a story that
transforms the quiet work of historical preservation into something
unspeakably sinister. Theodore Cain delivers a merchant ship yarn with
teeth in "The Jack-o'-Lantern Nebula" — and those of you who think of
Cain as our most dependable craftsman will be surprised by the
nightmares he has crafted here. Agnes Whitfield brings her spare,
haunting prose to the ruins of a collapsed civilization in "The
Inheritance of Teeth," a story whose title alone should give you pause.
Bob Finley trades his usual two-fisted adventure for a claustrophobic
paranoia thriller in "Nightwatch" — and proves that he can scare you
as effectively as he can thrill you. Phyllis Crenshaw bends time in a
most unsettling direction with "The Séance Machine," balancing dark
humor and genuine chills with her characteristic brilliance. And Oscar
Lennox closes our issue with "The Masked Ball," a story set in a
parallel world where the boundary between the living and the dead is
not what you think — and where All Hallows' Eve takes on an entirely
different significance.

Seven stories. Seven nightmares. I make no apologies.

Read them with the lights on, if you prefer. I did, after the first
pass. It did not help much.

Happy Halloween.

Yours in the dark,

Maxwell Sterling

                  THE THING IN THE WALLS OF THE WORLD

                       by Harrison Blackwood

================================================================================

                               I.

The face was not a face, of course. Not in any sense that the word
conventionally implied. It was a statistical artifact — a pattern in the
cosmic microwave background radiation that, when rendered as a visual
map using the spectral analysis software Dr. Selene Voss had been
refining for the better part of four years, bore a resemblance to a
human face in the same way that a cloud might bear a resemblance to a
castle, or a stain on a ceiling to a map of Europe. Pareidolia. The
brain's ancient, irrepressible compulsion to find faces in randomness.

That was what Voss told herself, at first.

She had discovered the pattern on a Tuesday evening in late September,
working alone in the basement laboratory of the Arecibo Radio
Observatory, where the air smelled of warm electronics and damp
concrete and where the only sound was the low, ceaseless hum of the
signal processing equipment that translated the whispers of the cosmos
into numbers. She had been running a new calibration sequence on the
CMB data — the most comprehensive map of the microwave background yet
assembled, compiled from fourteen months of observations and
representing, in its totality, the faint electromagnetic afterglow of
the universe's birth, the oldest light in existence, the first thing
the cosmos had ever said.

The calibration was routine. Voss had performed it a hundred times
before, adjusting the sensitivity parameters to filter out instrumental
noise and galactic foreground emission, refining the resolution of the
underlying cosmological signal. She expected nothing. The cosmic
microwave background was, by every measurement that had preceded hers,
uniform — a smooth, isotropic bath of radiation at a temperature of
approximately 2.7 degrees Kelvin, permeating all of space, the same in
every direction, the same from every vantage point, the same since the
universe had cooled enough, some three hundred thousand years after the
initial singularity, to become transparent to its own light.

Smooth. Uniform. Featureless.

Except that, at the resolution her new calibration achieved, it was not.

The anomaly appeared first as a cluster of temperature fluctuations in
the data — deviations from the expected uniformity that were too large
to be instrumental noise and too coherent to be random. Voss noticed
them at 8:47 PM, paused to check the calibration parameters, found them
nominal, and continued the analysis. By 9:30, the cluster had resolved
into a structure. By 10:15, the structure had resolved into a shape.

By 11:00, the shape had resolved into a face.

She sat very still in her chair, staring at the screen. The laboratory
was empty. The hum of the equipment surrounded her like a vast,
indifferent breathing. The face on her screen — rendered in false color,
blue for cold and red for hot, spanning a region of sky that was,
in physical terms, billions of light-years across — stared back at her
with an expression that was not an expression, features that were not
features, a gaze that was not a gaze.

And yet.

The proportions were wrong. That was the first thing she noticed, after
the initial shock had subsided enough to permit analysis. The geometry
of the face — if face it was — did not conform to human proportions. It
was too broad across what corresponded to the forehead, too narrow at
the approximation of a jaw. The features were asymmetrical in ways that
felt deliberate rather than random, as though the face had been
constructed by something that understood the concept of a face but had
built one to specifications that were not human. The eyes — and she
resisted calling them eyes, resisted with the full force of her
scientific training, but the word forced itself upon her like a hand on
her shoulder — the eyes were too widely spaced, too large in proportion
to the rest, and they were tilted at an angle that suggested a geometry
of vision fundamentally different from the binocular forward-facing
configuration of terrestrial primates.

It was pressed against the sky.

That was the thought that came to her, unbidden and irrational and
impossible to suppress: the face was pressed against the boundary of the
observable universe the way a child might press its face against a
window. From the outside. Looking in.

Voss closed the visualization program. She saved the data. She turned
off her monitor, put on her coat, and walked out of the laboratory into
the Puerto Rican night, where the air was warm and heavy with moisture
and the great dish of the Arecibo telescope hung above her in its
cradle of cables, a vast ear cupped toward the sky.

She looked up.

The stars were bright, as they always were in the mountains of Puerto
Rico, far from the light pollution of the coast. The Milky Way arched
across the zenith in a luminous band. Somewhere beyond those stars,
beyond the visible galaxies, beyond the farthest objects that any
telescope had ever detected, the cosmic microwave background shimmered
at the edge of the observable universe — the wall of first light, the
boundary beyond which nothing could be seen because the universe had not
yet existed long enough for light from those distances to reach the
Earth.

The wall. The boundary. The place where the face was pressed.

Voss stood in the dark for a long time. Then she went back inside and
looked at the data again.

                               II.

She told no one for three weeks.

This was not, she told herself, secrecy. It was scientific caution. The
anomaly required verification. The calibration required independent
confirmation. The possibility of instrumental artifact — some subtle
systematic error in the signal processing pipeline that might produce
the illusion of structure where none existed — had to be rigorously
excluded before any claim could be made.

All of this was true, and all of it was rationalization. The real reason
Voss told no one was that she was afraid.

Not of the face itself — or not primarily of the face. She was afraid
of what the face implied. The cosmic microwave background was the oldest
observable phenomenon in the universe. It had been emitted approximately
three hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, when the primordial
plasma had cooled enough for neutral atoms to form and for photons to
travel freely for the first time. Whatever pattern was encoded in that
radiation had been placed there — encoded, imprinted, structured — at
the very beginning. Before galaxies. Before stars. Before matter had
assembled itself into anything more complex than a hydrogen atom.

A face in the microwave background was not a message from somewhere else
in the universe. It was a feature of the universe itself. It was woven
into the fundamental fabric of space and time, as old as the oldest
light, as large as the observable cosmos, as permanent as the laws of
physics.

And it was looking at something.

Voss spent the three weeks verifying, reprocessing, testing. She ran the
data through seven different analysis pipelines, each using a different
noise-reduction algorithm, each making different assumptions about the
instrumental response function. In every case, the face appeared. She
contacted an old colleague at MIT — Dr. Karl Henning, a specialist in
CMB data analysis — and asked him, as a personal favor, to run an
independent verification using his own pipeline. She sent him the raw
data without comment, without mentioning the face, without telling him
what to look for.

Henning called her on October 15th at 6:00 AM, before she had finished
her coffee.

"Selene," he said, and his voice had the careful, controlled quality of
a man who has seen something that has shaken him. "What the hell is in
your data?"

"You found the anomaly."

"I found a — I found what appears to be a structured pattern in the CMB
at angular scales that should not contain any structure. My pipeline
gives me a chi-squared value that is — Selene, it is seventeen sigma
above the null hypothesis. This is not noise. This is not instrumental.
This is real."

"What does it look like to you, Karl?"

A long pause. She could hear him breathing.

"It looks like a face," he said. "But that's pareidolia. That has to be
pareidolia."

"Run the symmetry analysis. Check for bilateral symmetry, radial
symmetry, any organized geometric structure."

"I already did." Another pause. "It has bilateral symmetry. Approximate,
not exact. The kind of bilateral symmetry you see in biological
organisms. The left side is not a mirror image of the right — they're
similar but not identical. Like a real face."

"Like a real face."

"Selene, this cannot be what it looks like."

"I know."

"If this is real — if this structure was actually imprinted in the CMB
at recombination — then something organized it. Something arranged the
temperature fluctuations in a pattern that — Selene, I'm talking about
a pattern that spans the observable universe. Whatever made this was
operating at a scale that — I don't even know how to — "

"I know, Karl."

He was silent for a long time. "What are you going to do?"

"I'm going to publish."

                               III.

The paper appeared in Nature on November 3rd. It was twelve pages long,
dense with mathematics and spectral analysis, and it was titled with the
deliberate clinical detachment that Voss considered a form of armor:
"Anomalous Large-Scale Structure in the Cosmic Microwave Background:
Evidence for Organized Non-Random Patterning at Cosmological Scales."

The reaction was immediate and violent.

Within twenty-four hours, Voss had received over three hundred emails.
One hundred and twelve were from scientists offering to collaborate, to
verify, to debunk. Fifty-seven were from journalists requesting
interviews. Forty-three were from religious organizations claiming the
discovery as evidence of God. Twenty-eight were from individuals
claiming to have predicted the discovery through psychic means. And
nineteen were threats — some vague, some specific, all from people who
were very angry that a woman in a basement laboratory had suggested that
the universe might contain something that was not supposed to be there.

Within a week, five independent research groups had confirmed the
anomaly. The data was unambiguous. The structure was real. The only
question was what it meant.

The word "face" did not appear in Voss's paper. She had described the
structure in purely mathematical terms — a two-dimensional temperature
perturbation field exhibiting organized bilateral symmetry and
non-random feature distribution. But the human brain is what it is, and
the moment the paper's figures were reproduced in newspapers and
magazines, the word was inescapable. The face in the cosmic microwave
background. The face at the edge of the universe. The face in the walls
of the world.

Voss watched the storm from her basement laboratory, where the hum of
the equipment was the same as it had always been, and the data on her
screens was the same as it had been on that Tuesday evening in
September, and the face — that vast, inhuman, impossibly ancient
face — stared out from her monitor with an expression that she still
could not name.

It was not anger. It was not curiosity. It was not the serene, divine
composure that the religious interpretations projected onto it, nor the
threatening alien menace that the tabloids preferred. It was something
else. Something that did not map onto any human emotional category.
Something that existed in a register that the human brain could
perceive but not classify, the way a dog might perceive a color that
falls outside the canine visual spectrum — a sensation without a name,
a meaning without a language.

Voss stared at the face, and the face stared at Voss, and between them
lay thirteen billion years and the entire observable universe, and
neither of them blinked.

                               IV.

The first indication that something had changed came from the radio
telescopes.

Dr. Emil Vasquez, a postdoctoral researcher at Arecibo who had been
assigned to monitor the anomaly as part of the follow-up observation
program, noticed it on December 9th. He was running a comparison between
the current CMB data and the dataset from Voss's original detection,
looking for any evidence of temporal variation — a standard check, but
one that no one expected to yield results. The cosmic microwave
background did not change. It was, by definition, a fossil: the remnant
of an event that had occurred billions of years ago, fixed and
immutable, as static as the past itself.

Vasquez found a variation.

It was small — a shift of less than one microkelvin in a cluster of
pixels near the center of the anomaly, in the region that corresponded,
in the face's geometry, to the mouth. The shift was within the margin
of instrumental uncertainty, and Vasquez's first impulse was to dismiss
it as calibration drift. But something about it troubled him. The shift
was not random. It was directional — the temperature gradient had moved,
coherently, across a region spanning approximately three degrees of arc.
As though something had changed position.

As though the mouth had moved.

Vasquez ran the comparison again, using a tighter error budget and a
more conservative noise model. The shift persisted. He ran it a third
time. A fourth. Each time, the result was the same: the CMB had changed.
Not everywhere. Not uniformly. Only in the region of the face. Only in
the region of the mouth.

He brought the data to Voss at 3:00 AM on December 10th. She was still
in the laboratory — she was always in the laboratory now, subsisting on
coffee and candy bars from the vending machine, sleeping in snatches on
the couch in her office, her hair unwashed, her clothes unchanged for
three days. Henning had noticed and said nothing. Vasquez had noticed
and was concerned.

"Dr. Voss," he said, laying the printouts on her desk. "I found
something."

She looked at the data. She looked at it for a long time.

"When?" she asked.

"I first noticed it four hours ago. The comparison dataset is from
October 14th — eight weeks ago. The shift has occurred since then."

"The CMB doesn't change, Emil."

"No, ma'am. It doesn't."

They looked at each other. The hum of the equipment filled the silence.

"Pull the intermediate datasets," Voss said. "Weekly intervals, from
October 14th through today. I want to see the progression."

It took Vasquez two hours. When the time-series visualization was
complete, Voss sat at her screen and watched it — a sequence of false-
color maps of the face, each separated by one week, played in order.

In the first frame, the face wore its original expression — the one
that Voss had been staring at for months, the one that existed in a
register beyond human emotional taxonomy, the one that she had come to
think of, in the privacy of her own mind, as The Look.

In the second frame, the mouth had shifted. Fractionally. Almost
imperceptibly. But the shift was there, and it was in a direction that
Voss's brain, interpreting the data through the lens of its irrepressible
pareidolia, could only describe in one way.

The mouth was opening.

In the third frame, it had opened further. In the fourth, further still.
By the eighth frame — the most recent data — the mouth was open wide,
the temperature fluctuations rearranged into a configuration that
suggested, with nauseating clarity, a gaping aperture. A void within
the face. An opening.

Voss's hands were shaking. She gripped the edge of her desk.

"It's moving," Vasquez said, unnecessarily. "Dr. Voss, the face is
moving."

"I can see that."

"But this is the CMB. This radiation was emitted thirteen billion years
ago. It can't change. It's — it's a photograph of the early universe.
Photographs don't change."

Voss said nothing. She was staring at the screen, at the gaping mouth
of the thing in the walls of the world, and she was thinking — with the
cold, precise, helpless clarity that comes when a scientist confronts
data that violates every assumption on which her understanding of
reality is built — that Vasquez was wrong. Not about the physics. About
the metaphor. The CMB was not a photograph.

It was a window.

And something on the other side of the window was pressing its face
against the glass. And now it was opening its mouth.

                               V.

The news of the change broke on December 15th, when Voss's second paper
was published — hastily written, barely reviewed, driven into print by
the urgency of the data and Voss's growing conviction that speed
mattered more than polish. The paper described the temporal variation in
clinical language that could not fully conceal its author's alarm. The
face in the cosmic microwave background was not static. It was
changing. It was moving. Over a period of eight weeks, the configuration
of temperature fluctuations in the anomalous region had shifted in a
manner consistent with articulated motion of the facial features.

The face was changing its expression.

The reaction to the second paper made the reaction to the first look
like a tea party. Governments issued statements. The Vatican convened an
emergency theological council. Three separate doomsday cults formed
within forty-eight hours of publication. The stock market fell eleven
percent in a single day and did not recover. The United Nations Security
Council held a closed session, the proceedings of which were never
published.

And in observatories around the world, telescopes that had been pointed
at distant galaxies and nearby stars and interesting nebulae were
redirected, one by one, toward the cosmic microwave background. Toward
the face. Toward the mouth that was opening.

At Arecibo, Voss worked without sleeping. She had assembled a team of
twelve — physicists, cosmologists, data analysts, one traumatized
philosopher of science named Dr. Irene Hadley who had been brought in
to provide "conceptual framework" and who spent most of her time sitting
in a corner with her head in her hands, murmuring. The team monitored
the face in real time, updating their measurements every six hours,
tracking the progression of the expression change with the meticulous
horror of doctors monitoring the spread of a disease they could neither
treat nor comprehend.

The change was accelerating.

In the first eight weeks, the mouth had opened by approximately three
degrees of arc — a shift that corresponded, in the face's scale, to a
distance of roughly two billion light-years. In the two weeks following
the publication of the second paper, it opened by four more degrees. The
eyes — those vast, too-wide, inhuman eyes — had begun to narrow, the
temperature gradients around them contracting in a way that suggested,
with horrible specificity, focus. As though the thing behind the face
had been looking vaguely into the universe and was now looking at
something in particular.

"It's looking at us," Henning said, on the telephone from MIT. His
voice was flat, drained of inflection. "Selene, run the pointing
analysis. Check the axis of symmetry against the Earth's position in
the CMB rest frame."

Voss ran it. She already knew what the result would be.

The axis of the face's bilateral symmetry — the line that bisected it
from top to bottom, the line that ran between the eyes and down the
center of the opening mouth — pointed directly at the Earth. Not at the
Sun. Not at the Milky Way. At the Earth, specifically, to within the
precision of the measurement.

"How is that possible?" Vasquez asked, reading the result over her
shoulder. "We're one planet in one solar system in one galaxy. The face
is the size of the observable universe. How can it be looking at us?"

"I don't know."

"It implies awareness. It implies — my God, it implies intentionality
at a cosmological scale. Something that can orient itself with respect
to a single planet across thirteen billion light-years — "

"I know what it implies, Emil."

"What do we do?"

Voss closed her eyes. She was very tired. She had not slept in fifty-
two hours and had eaten nothing since the previous morning. The hum of
the equipment was inside her skull now, a vibration that was part of her
the way her heartbeat was part of her. She thought about the face. She
thought about the mouth. She thought about what the opening of a mouth,
in any context she had ever encountered, typically preceded.

Something was going to speak.

Or something was going to enter.

Or — and this was the thought that she could not bear to complete, the
thought that she pushed away each time it approached, the thought that
crept back in the quiet moments like water seeping through a crack in a
wall — or the mouth was not opening.

It was widening. Thinning. Dissolving.

Not a mouth opening. A barrier weakening. A wall developing a hole.

                               VI.

By January, the face had changed beyond recognition.

The features that Voss had first detected in September — the too-wide
eyes, the asymmetric jaw, the broad forehead — had undergone a series
of transformations that were, in their aggregate, indescribable. The
face was still a face, in the sense that the human brain still
interpreted the pattern as a face. But it was no longer the same face.
It had gone through expressions — or states, or phases, or
configurations, none of the available words were adequate — that
corresponded to no human emotional experience. The temperature maps
showed arrangements of gradient and fluctuation that the brain
recognized as meaningful, as expressive, as communicating something,
but that the conscious mind could not decode.

Irene Hadley, the philosopher of science, had stopped murmuring in her
corner and had begun writing. She filled three notebooks in ten days
with dense, barely legible prose that attempted to describe the
experience of looking at the face's new expressions. Voss read the
notebooks and found them simultaneously brilliant and useless. Hadley
had coined the term "trans-affective states" to describe what the face
appeared to be expressing — emotional configurations that exceeded the
human emotional vocabulary, feelings that existed in dimensions the
human psyche did not possess.

"It is as though," Hadley wrote, "someone were projecting colors onto
a screen for an audience that can only see in black and white. We
perceive that something is there. We perceive that it is structured, that
it is meaningful, that it is intended to convey information. But we lack
the receptor apparatus to decode it. We are looking at a message written
in a language that uses an alphabet our brains do not contain."

The mouth — the region that Voss had initially identified as a mouth,
the region where the opening had first been detected — had continued to
change. It was no longer recognizable as a mouth. It had become
something else: a distortion in the CMB that defied characterization. A
region where the temperature fluctuations were not fluctuating but
were instead holding steady at values that should have been impossible —
temperatures that were too high, too low, too precisely uniform, as
though the background radiation in that region were being overwritten by
something from outside.

The wall of the world was thinning. Something was pressing through.

Voss knew this. She knew it with a certainty that was not scientific
but was, she suspected, something deeper and older than science — the
certainty of a small animal that senses the predator before it sees
it, the certainty that lives in the spine rather than the cortex.
Something was on the other side of the observable universe, and it was
coming through.

The question — the only question that still mattered — was what it was.

                               * * *

On January 22nd, Voss received a communication from the International
Astronomical Union. Seven independent observatories had now confirmed
the temporal variation in the anomaly. Three of them — in Chile,
Australia, and Japan — had detected additional features that Arecibo had
missed: secondary patterns in the CMB, smaller than the face but
exhibiting the same organized, non-random structure. They were clustered
around the face, in regions that corresponded to the jaw and the
temples and the area behind where the ears would be if the face had
ears. They were arranged symmetrically.

They looked like hands.

Hands pressed flat against the inside of the boundary. Fingers splayed.
Pushing.

Voss read the IAU communication sitting alone in her laboratory at 3:00
AM, and she felt the blood leave her face and her hands grow cold and
her heart execute a syncopated stumble that was, she recognized, the
physiological signature of terror. Not anxiety. Not unease. Terror. The
deep, ancestral, pre-linguistic terror of a primate confronting
something vast and incomprehensible in the dark.

The face was not merely pressing against the boundary of the observable
universe.

It was trying to get in.

                               VII.

She called Henning. It was 4:00 AM in Puerto Rico, 5:00 AM in Boston.
He answered on the second ring.

"Karl. The IAU data."

"I've seen it."

"The hands."

"I've seen them."

"What do we do?"

A pause. She could hear, through the phone, the sound of Henning's
breathing — steady, deliberate, the breathing of a man who was forcing
himself to remain calm.

"Selene, I need to tell you something. Something I haven't told anyone."

"What?"

"I've been running theoretical models. Trying to understand the
mechanism — how the CMB can change in real time, how something can
exert influence on radiation that was emitted thirteen billion years
ago. The standard model doesn't allow it. No modification of the
standard model allows it. I've tried every framework I can think of —
every extension, every alternative cosmology, every speculative theory
from the last thirty years. None of them work."

"I know. I've been trying the same thing."

"Then you've reached the same conclusion."

Voss closed her eyes. "Tell me yours."

"The CMB is changing because the CMB is not what we think it is. It is
not fossil radiation from the Big Bang. It is not a relic of a
historical event. It is — the best analogy I can construct — it is the
inner surface of a boundary. A membrane. The wall of a container. And
the temperature fluctuations we have always interpreted as primordial
density perturbations — the seeds of galaxies, the fingerprint of the
early universe — they are not cosmological structures at all. They are
the texture of the wall itself. The grain of the material."

"And the face."

"The face is something on the other side of the wall. Pressing against
it. Deforming it. The way a face pressed against a sheet of rubber
would create a pattern in the surface of the rubber — a pattern that,
to a two-dimensional creature living on the surface, would appear as a
mysterious structure in its sky."

"So we are inside something."

"We are inside something, and something outside is trying to get in."

Voss was silent. The hum of the equipment surrounded her, and in that
moment it did not sound like machinery. It sounded like the resonance
of a chamber. A container. A box.

"Karl," she said. "The acceleration. The fact that the change is
speeding up."

"Yes."

"If the wall is a membrane, and the face is pressing against it, and
the pressing is intensifying — "

"Then the membrane is stretching."

"And if it stretches far enough — "

"It breaks."

They said nothing for a long time. Through the phone, Voss could hear
Henning's clock ticking, steady and mechanical and indifferent. Tick.
Tick. Tick.

"How long?" she asked.

"I don't know. The acceleration curve is exponential, but I don't have
enough data points to project the asymptote with confidence. If the
current rate holds — if it doesn't accelerate further — months. A year
at the outside."

"And if it does accelerate further?"

"Weeks."

"What happens when it breaks?"

"Selene, I have no idea. I have no framework for predicting what
happens when the boundary of the observable universe is breached from
the outside. No one has a framework for that. The concept is — it
isn't even wrong. It's outside the domain of any physical theory that
has ever been constructed."

"Karl."

"Yes."

"Are you frightened?"

Another pause. "I am a sixty-three-year-old physicist with high blood
pressure, a bad marriage, and a dog that needs walking. I have spent my
entire career studying the residual radiation from the Big Bang. I
thought I was studying the history of the universe. It turns out I was
studying the wall of a cage." He took a breath. "Yes, Selene. I am
frightened."

                               VIII.

In the weeks that followed, the world did what the world always does
when confronted with the incomprehensible: it argued.

The scientific community split into factions. One group — led by a
consortium of cosmologists in Europe — insisted that the anomaly must
have a conventional explanation, that some undiscovered systematic error
or unconsidered physical mechanism would eventually account for the data.
They were producing papers at an extraordinary rate, each one proposing
a new model, each model more baroque and less convincing than the last.
Their certainty was fierce and increasingly shrill, and Voss recognized
in it the particular desperation of intelligent people whose worldview
was collapsing.

A second group — smaller, quieter, centered on the theoretical physics
departments of Caltech and Cambridge — had accepted the data and was
attempting to construct a new framework to accommodate it. They spoke
of brane cosmology, of the universe as a three-dimensional membrane
embedded in a higher-dimensional space, of the CMB boundary as the
interface between their brane and something else. Their mathematics was
elegant and their conclusions were terrifying, and they published them
with the calm detachment of people who had decided that terror was
unproductive.

A third group had stopped doing science altogether and had begun to
pray.

The general public, meanwhile, had entered a state of sustained panic
that manifested differently in different cultures but that shared, at
its core, the same primal response: something was out there, and it was
coming in, and no one knew what it was or what it wanted or whether the
concept of "wanting" was even applicable to something that operated at
the scale of the observable universe.

Churches overflowed. Synagogues overflowed. Mosques overflowed. Temples
and ashrams and meditation centers overflowed. New cults formed daily —
cults that worshipped the face, cults that cursed it, cults that
claimed to have been in communication with it for years. A group in
Nevada built a radio transmitter and aimed it at the sky and broadcast
a message that read, in its entirety: "WE ARE HERE. WE SEE YOU. WHAT
DO YOU WANT?" They received no response.

The military establishments of the major powers were, predictably, the
most alarmed and the least useful. The United States Air Force issued a
classified assessment concluding that the anomaly represented a
potential national security threat, which was technically accurate in
the same way that describing the Sun as a potential fire hazard was
technically accurate. The Soviet Union moved three divisions to positions
of "enhanced readiness," though against what enemy and for what purpose,
no one could say. The British government issued a statement urging calm,
which had, as British government statements urging calm always did, the
opposite effect.

Voss ignored all of it. She had no time for argument, no energy for
panic, no patience for the thousand competing interpretations that the
world was generating at an ever-increasing rate. She had data. The data
was unambiguous. The face was pressing through. The hands were pushing.
The wall was thinning.

She worked. She measured. She watched.

                               IX.

On February 14th — Valentine's Day, a fact that struck Voss as absurdly
incongruous — the face changed again.

It happened in real time, which was itself impossible and which was by
now merely the latest in a series of impossibilities that had long since
exhausted Voss's capacity for surprise. The team was on watch — six of
them in the laboratory, monitoring the CMB data on the real-time feed,
drinking coffee that tasted of nothing and eating sandwiches that might
as well have been cardboard for all the attention anyone paid them.
Vasquez saw it first.

"Dr. Voss," he said, and his voice cracked on the second syllable.

She looked at the screen. The false-color map of the face — by now
familiar, burned into her retinas, a constant presence in her waking
and sleeping hours — was changing. Not gradually, not over hours or
days, but now. In front of her eyes.

The eyes — those vast, too-wide, inhuman eyes that had narrowed to
focus, that had oriented themselves on the Earth with impossible
precision — were closing.

Not slowly. Not gently. With a movement that spanned billions of
light-years in seconds, the temperature gradients that formed the
eyes contracted, the fluctuations rearranging themselves with fluid,
purposeful speed, and the eyes closed.

And the mouth — the opening that had widened for months, the breach in
the wall of the world, the aperture through which something immense
and unknown had been preparing to enter — the mouth was closing too.

The face was withdrawing.

Voss stared at the screen. Her heart was hammering, and her mind was
a chaos of competing hypotheses, and somewhere beneath the scientist's
trained response of "observe, analyze, understand" was a small, primitive
part of her brain that was screaming.

Because the expression on the face — the trans-affective state, the
emotional configuration that existed in registers the human psyche did
not possess — had changed one final time. And this time, for the first
time, Voss could read it. Not fully. Not completely. But partially,
the way one might partially understand a sentence in a foreign
language — catching a word here, a phrase there, assembling from
fragments an approximation of meaning.

The face was not retreating.

It was preparing.

The eyes had closed not in withdrawal but in the manner of something
gathering itself. The mouth had closed not in resignation but in the
manner of something that has finished looking and has decided to act.
The hands — still visible, still pressed against the boundary, still
splayed and pushing — had not relaxed. They had tensed.

Irene Hadley, standing at the back of the laboratory with her
notebooks clutched to her chest, said in a small, clear voice:

"It was examining us. It's done examining. It's decided."

"Decided what?" Vasquez asked.

Hadley said nothing. She did not need to. The face on the screen, eyes
closed, mouth closed, hands pressed flat against the wall of the world,
was an image that required no interpretation. It was the face of
something that had been studying what lay on the other side of a barrier,
and that had reached a conclusion about what it found there, and that
was now — calmly, deliberately, with the patience of something that
operated on a timescale that made human history look like the flash of
a matchhead — preparing to come through.

Not trying. Preparing. There was a difference.

Trying implied effort, uncertainty, the possibility of failure.

Preparing implied a decision. A schedule. An intention.

Voss looked at the screen. The face looked back at her from behind its
closed eyes — she could feel it looking, even with the eyes shut, could
feel its attention on her like pressure on her skin, like the weight of
deep water, like the gaze of something so vast that being seen by it
was itself a kind of obliteration — and she understood, with a clarity
that was indistinguishable from despair, that the wall of the world
had never been a barrier.

It had been a one-way mirror.

And the thing on the other side had been watching for a very long time.
Watching, and waiting, and making up its mind.

                               * * *

The data stabilized on February 15th. The face ceased changing. The
hands remained in position. The mouth remained closed. The eyes remained
shut. The measurements held steady, hour after hour, day after day,
the false-color maps identical from one observation to the next, as
though the thing in the walls of the world had settled into its final
configuration and was now simply — waiting.

Voss published her third paper on February 20th. It was four pages
long — the shortest of the three, and the one that said the most.
It described the closing of the face's features, the stabilization of
the data, and the implications of both. It concluded with a single
paragraph that departed from scientific convention and entered the
territory of something older and more urgent:

     The entity in the cosmic microwave background — for we must now
     use the word "entity," however reluctantly — has ceased its
     apparent examination of the interior of the observable universe.
     The most parsimonious interpretation of the available data is
     that it has completed a survey of some kind and has arrived at
     a determination. What that determination is, we cannot know.
     Whether it portends action, we cannot know. What form such action
     might take, we cannot know. We know only this: the wall of the
     observable universe is not a natural boundary. It is a surface.
     And something on the other side of that surface is aware of us.

The paper was published on a Thursday. By Friday, the streets of every
major city in the world were either empty or overflowing, depending on
whether their inhabitants had chosen to hide or to gather.

Voss remained at Arecibo. She sat in her laboratory, surrounded by the
hum of equipment that had taught her the shape of the universe, and she
watched the face on her screen — eyes closed, mouth closed, hands
pressed against the wall — and she waited.

The face waited too.

                               X.

Three months passed. The face did not move. The data did not change.
The world, gradually, began to exhale.

The newspapers ran fewer stories. The doomsday cults lost members. The
stock market recovered to within four percent of its pre-anomaly levels.
People returned to their jobs, their routines, their ordinary concerns.
The cosmic microwave background, with its frozen face and its motionless
hands, receded from the front pages to the interior sections to the
academic journals to the quiet, persistent murmur of specialized
research, where it joined the long list of phenomena that humanity
acknowledged, did not understand, and had decided to live with.

Voss watched this normalization with something that was not quite
contempt and not quite despair. It was, she thought, the most human
thing she had ever witnessed: the capacity to absorb the unthinkable
and continue making breakfast. The wall of the world was thin. Something
vast and unknowable was pressed against the other side, its eyes closed,
its hands splayed, its intentions unreadable. And humanity had looked at
this, had screamed, had wept, had prayed, had rioted — and then had
gone back to work.

She did not go back to work. She could not. She sat in her laboratory
and she watched the face, and she waited, and she understood that she
would spend the rest of her life waiting. That she had become, by
virtue of being the first to see it, the keeper of the watch. The
sentry at the wall. The woman who stared at the face and waited for
the eyes to open.

Henning visited in May. He looked old. Older than his years. The weight
of the discovery had settled into his face and his posture, and he
moved with the careful slowness of a man carrying something heavy and
fragile.

They sat in the laboratory together, drinking the terrible vending
machine coffee, watching the unchanging face on the screen.

"I keep thinking about scale," Henning said. "The face is the size of
the observable universe. Its eyes, individually, are larger than the
Virgo Supercluster. The distance between its hands is measured in
billions of light-years. And it is looking at us. At this planet.
This one planet, orbiting this one star, in this one galaxy, among
two hundred billion galaxies."

"Yes."

"Why?"

"I don't know."

"What could possibly interest something that vast in something this
small?"

Voss was quiet for a long time. She looked at the face. She had been
looking at it for months — for so many hours that it had become, in a
sense, more familiar to her than her own face, which she saw only
briefly in mirrors and which changed with age and fatigue and the slow
erosion of time. The face in the CMB did not change. It waited.

"Maybe it's not about interest," she said. "Maybe it's not about us at
all. Maybe we're incidental. A detail. The equivalent of an ant on a
windowsill, noticed by someone looking through the glass at something
else entirely."

"Then what is it looking at?"

"The universe. All of it. The whole interior. We just happen to be in
the line of sight."

"That's a comforting thought."

"No. It isn't. Because if we're incidental, then whatever it does
next — whatever it decided, whatever it's preparing for — it won't
consider us at all. It won't avoid us or protect us or even notice us.
We'll be in the way. The way an ant is in the way when someone opens
a window."

Henning set down his coffee. His hands, she noticed, were trembling.

"You know what the worst part is?" he said.

"Tell me."

"The worst part is the waiting. If it were coming through now — right
now, this instant — at least it would be over. At least we'd know.
But this — this patience, this terrible, cosmic patience — the
closed eyes, the still hands, the waiting — it implies a timescale so
far beyond ours that our entire civilization could rise and fall between
one moment of its attention and the next. It could be preparing for
something that won't happen for a million years. And we'll spend every
one of those years watching. Waiting. Not knowing."

Voss nodded. She understood. She had been living inside that waiting
for months, and she knew that she would live inside it for the rest
of her life, and that her children would inherit it, and their children
after them, and every generation of humanity from this point forward
would live under the gaze of the thing in the walls of the world,
never knowing when the eyes would open, never knowing what the opening
would bring.

This was the new human condition. Not a catastrophe. Not an apocalypse.
Something worse: an unanswerable question, pressed against the sky
like a face against glass, waiting with the patience of something
that had been old when the universe was young.

Voss reached for her coffee. It was cold. She drank it anyway.

On the screen, the face waited. Eyes closed. Mouth closed. Hands
against the wall.

Waiting.

                            [THE END]

                      THE PRESERVATION SOCIETY

                          by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                               I.

I should state at the outset that I am not mad.

I am aware that this assertion, appearing as the opening line of what
will inevitably be read as a confession, does little to support itself.
The mad, after all, are famously convinced of their sanity, and any
account that begins by insisting upon the narrator's rationality has,
by that very insistence, cast doubt upon it. I understand this. I
accept the paradox. Nonetheless, I state it plainly: I am not mad. The
things I have seen are real. The thing I have done — or rather, the
thing I have failed to prevent — is real. And if the consequences of
that failure are what I believe them to be, then the question of my
sanity is the least of anyone's concerns.

My name is Alice Thorne. I am — I was — the curator of the Vandermere
Preservation Society, which is responsible for the maintenance and
conservation of the alien ruins on the colony world of Ashlar. I held
this position for three years, seven months, and eleven days. I
resigned four days ago. I am writing this account in the port town of
Kellis, in a rented room above a chandler's shop, while I wait for the
next transport off-world. If the transport arrives before the ruins are
finished, I will board it. If it does not, the question of boarding will
become academic.

I should explain.

                               II.

Ashlar is a world of gray stone and gray water and gray sky, settled
by the Third Colonial Expansion forty-two years ago and never quite
reconciled to human habitation. The colony occupies a narrow coastal
strip on the southern continent — a string of fishing towns and
mining settlements clinging to the shore like barnacles on a hull. The
interior of the continent is mountainous, forested with a species of
tall, narrow tree that the colonists call black pines, though they are
neither black nor pines, and veined with rivers that run cold and fast
and the color of tea.

The ruins are in the mountains.

They were discovered in the second year of the colony's existence, when
a survey team mapping the highland plateau stumbled upon them in a
valley approximately sixty kilometers inland from the coast. The initial
reports described them as the remains of a city — an extensive complex
of structures built from a dark, vitreous stone that did not match any
geological formation on the planet. The structures were old. Carbon
dating of organic material found within them suggested an age of between
eight and twelve thousand years. Whatever civilization had built them
was long extinct. No living alien species had been found on Ashlar, and
no evidence of a surviving population was ever discovered.

The ruins were, by any reasonable assessment, extraordinary.

They covered an area of approximately four square kilometers, arranged
in a pattern that the initial survey team described as "concentric" —
rings of structures radiating outward from a central point, connected
by pathways that ran between them in straight, precise lines. The
structures themselves were varied in form: some were tall and columnar,
some were low and domed, some were connected by arched bridges at
various heights, and some were — the word that appears most frequently
in the early reports is "unclassifiable." They did not correspond to
any known architectural function. They were shapes, rendered in dark
stone with extreme precision, that served no purpose the survey team
could determine.

The central structure was the largest. It rose from the center of the
concentric rings like a black glass spike, roughly conical, tapering to
a point that was, at the time of discovery, approximately one hundred
and forty meters above the valley floor. Its surface was smooth and
featureless — no doors, no windows, no seams, no ornamentation of any
kind. It appeared to be a single piece. When struck, it produced a low,
resonant tone that the survey team leader described as "the sound of a
bell ringing underwater."

The Vandermere Preservation Society was established the following year,
funded by a bequest from the estate of the colony's wealthiest founder,
a mining magnate named Cedric Vandermere who had, in the last years of
his life, developed an intense interest in xenoarchaeology. The
Society's mandate was simple and explicit: maintain the ruins in their
original condition. Prevent decay, prevent vandalism, prevent
unauthorized excavation. Preserve them exactly as they were found, for
future generations and future scholarship.

I arrived on Ashlar three years ago to take up the post of curator.
My predecessor, a man named Elmore Gannt, had held the position for
seven years and had resigned abruptly, citing what he described in his
resignation letter as "personal reasons that I am unable to elaborate
upon." I did not think much of this at the time. Ashlar was an isolated
posting, the work was solitary, and many people found the ruins
unsettling. Gannt would not be the first person whose nerves had been
worn thin by proximity to something old and alien and not meant for
human eyes.

I was not, I thought, the sort of person whose nerves were easily worn.

I was wrong.

                               III.

The work of preservation was, for the first year, straightforward. The
ruins required regular maintenance: clearance of vegetation that grew
between the stones, repair of erosion damage to the pathways, monitoring
of structural integrity in the older sections where the vitreous stone
had begun, in places, to develop microscopic fractures. I employed a
small team — three laborers from the nearby town of Millhaven, rough,
practical men who regarded the ruins with the comfortable indifference
of people who had grown up near them and who viewed them as a local
curiosity rather than a source of wonder or dread.

I kept detailed records, as the Society's charter required. I
photographed each section of the ruins at monthly intervals, maintaining
a visual archive that documented the state of every structure, every
pathway, every stone. I measured the dimensions of key features. I
catalogued damage and recorded repairs. I was meticulous. I was
thorough. I was, I believe, a good curator.

It was the photographs that first alerted me to the anomaly.

In my ninth month, during a routine review of the monthly archives, I
noticed a discrepancy. A structure in the outer ring — a low, dome-
shaped building that I had designated Structure 7-C — appeared to have
changed. Not its condition. Not its state of repair. Its form. In the
photographs from my first month, the dome was approximately two meters
in height and three meters in diameter, with a smooth, unbroken surface.
In the photographs from my ninth month, the dome was approximately two
point three meters in height, the diameter had increased to three point
four meters, and a seam had appeared near the base — a hairline fissure
in the stone, running in a straight line from one side to the other,
as though the dome were preparing to open.

I checked my measurements. They confirmed the photographic evidence.
Structure 7-C was larger than it had been when I arrived. It had grown.

I examined the structure in person. The growth was subtle — a few
centimeters in height, a few more in diameter — but it was unmistakable.
The stone was the same dark, vitreous material as the rest of the ruins.
The new growth was indistinguishable from the original structure in
color, texture, and density. There was no visible mechanism of
accretion — no sign of sediment, no biological growth, no crystalline
deposition. The dome had simply — expanded. As though the stone itself
were alive.

I told no one. I told myself that I was being thorough, that I needed
more data before drawing conclusions, that I wanted to rule out
measurement error and photographic distortion. I told myself all the
rational things. And I went back to my monthly reviews and began
examining the archives more carefully.

                               IV.

Structure 7-C was not an anomaly. It was a norm.

Once I knew what to look for, I found it everywhere. Every structure in
the ruins was changing. Not decaying. Not eroding. Growing. Shifting.
Rearranging. The tall columnar structures in the third ring had gained
height — fractional centimeters per month, but measurable, consistent,
cumulative. The bridges between structures were extending, their arches
widening by degrees so small that the eye could not detect them but the
measuring tape could not deny. The pathways — those straight, precise
lines connecting the concentric rings — were lengthening, millimeter by
millimeter, reaching toward each other, closing gaps that I had assumed
were gaps but which were, I now understood, unfinished connections.

The ruins were not ruins.

They were incomplete. They were — the word forced itself upon me with
the slow, dreadful inevitability of water rising in a flooding
cellar — they were under construction.

Whatever the builders had begun eight thousand years ago, they had not
finished. And the structures they had left behind had been, with
geological patience, finishing themselves. Growing, shifting, extending,
connecting — building. The process was so slow, so far below the
threshold of human perception, that forty-two years of colonial
habitation had not detected it. The survey teams had seen static ruins.
The archaeologists had seen dead architecture. The Preservation Society
had seen artifacts to be maintained.

No one had seen what was actually happening, because what was actually
happening was happening at a timescale that made human attention spans
look like the flash of a camera: a single bright instant, too brief to
capture the motion it illuminated.

I sat in my office in the small stone building that the Society used
as a headquarters, at the edge of the ruins, and I looked at my
photographs — months of them, years of them, Gannt's archives going
back seven years before that — and I watched the ruins move. Frame by
frame. Month by month. The slow, patient, inexorable motion of a
machine assembling itself from its own components.

And then I understood something else. Something that made the blood
drain from my face and my hands go cold on the surface of my desk.

The preservation work. The Society's work. My work. For forty-two
years, the Vandermere Preservation Society had been maintaining the
ruins in their "original condition." Clearing vegetation. Repairing
erosion. Filling cracks. Stabilizing foundations. Protecting the
structures from the slow, destructive forces of weather and entropy
that would, without intervention, have degraded and eventually
destroyed them.

Without the Preservation Society, the ruins would have crumbled.

Without the Preservation Society, the self-assembling machine would
have ground to a halt, its components degraded beyond function, its
slow construction halted by the same forces of decay that destroyed
every other structure on every other world where civilization had risen
and fallen.

The Society had not been preserving artifacts. It had been maintaining
a machine. Its work — my work — had been the life support system that
kept the machine functioning during the millennia-long interval between
the departure of its builders and the completion of its construction.

I was not a curator. I was a caretaker.

And the machine was almost finished.

                               V.

I went to the central structure — the black glass spike — the following
morning, as the gray dawn light filtered through the black pines and
the valley filled with the cold mist that rose from the river every
day at first light.

The spike had changed. I could see it from a distance, and even at a
distance, the change was visible to the naked eye, which meant it
was larger than any previous change, which meant the process was
accelerating.

A seam had appeared in the surface. Not a crack — not the kind of
damage that the Society would normally repair. A seam. A precise,
vertical line running from the base of the spike to a height of
approximately thirty meters, straight as a plumb line, with the
machined regularity of a designed joint. An opening. A door.

Or rather — the beginning of a door. The seam was hairline-thin,
barely visible except when the light struck it at the right angle.
But it was there, and it had not been there the day before, and its
implications were as clear and as terrible as a siren in the night.

The machine was opening.

I stood before the spike in the cold morning mist and I felt the
history of the place — the deep, inhuman history, thousands of years
of slow, patient construction — pressing down on me like the weight of
the stone itself. The builders. Who were they? Where had they gone? Why
had they built this thing — this vast, concentric, self-assembling
mechanism — and then departed, leaving it to finish itself over
millennia? What was it for?

What would it do when it was complete?

I reached out and touched the seam. The stone was cold — colder than
the morning air, colder than any stone should have been, as though the
cold were not merely an absence of heat but a presence in itself, a
quality of the material, a property as fundamental as its color or its
density. My fingertips went numb instantly, and I pulled my hand away.

And then I heard it.

Not the resonant tone the survey team had described — not the bell
ringing underwater. Something else. Something beneath that, or perhaps
within it, the way a whisper can exist within a shout. A vibration. A
frequency. Not a sound in the conventional sense — I did not hear it
with my ears so much as feel it in the bones of my hand, transmitted
through the brief contact with the stone, a vibration that traveled up
my arm and into my chest and settled there like a second heartbeat.

The machine was humming. It was alive. It was aware.

Not aware in the way that a person is aware, or even in the way that
an animal is aware. Aware in the way that a river is aware of its
banks, or a fire is aware of its fuel. Aware of its own process. Aware
that it was building. Aware that it was nearly finished.

Aware, perhaps, that I was standing before it.

I backed away. The vibration in my chest faded slowly, like the after-
ring of a struck bell, and by the time I reached the edge of the
clearing where the headquarters building stood, it was gone. But the
memory of it — the deep, structural, inhuman hum of a machine that had
been building itself for eight thousand years and was now, at last,
approaching completion — that memory settled into a space between my
ribs and did not leave.

I went inside and poured myself a drink from the bottle of whiskey I
kept in my desk drawer. It was 7:00 AM. I did not care.

                               VI.

The question was: what do I do?

I could report my findings to the colonial government. They would
send a team — archaeologists, engineers, military personnel. They
would study the ruins. They would debate. They would form committees.
They would produce reports. And by the time they had finished
debating, the machine would have finished building, and the question
of what to do about it would be moot.

I could destroy the ruins. The thought came to me and I recoiled from
it, not from moral scruple but from practical doubt. How does one
destroy a structure made of a material that has resisted eight thousand
years of weathering without significant degradation? The vitreous stone
was harder than anything the colony possessed the tools to cut. I had
tried, in my first months, to take a sample for analysis, and had been
unable to chip so much as a flake from the surface. Explosives, perhaps.
The colony's mining operations used blasting charges. But the ruins
covered four square kilometers. Destroying them would require a quantity
of explosive that the colony did not possess and could not obtain.

I could simply leave. Board the next transport. Go somewhere else.
Let whatever was going to happen, happen. The universe was large, and
Ashlar was small, and if a machine that had been building itself for
eight thousand years finally completed its construction on a minor
colony world at the edge of settled space, perhaps the consequences
would be local. Perhaps they would be contained. Perhaps I could
outrun them.

I did not believe this for an instant, but I considered it anyway,
because desperation does not observe the protocols of logic.

I could — and this was the option that terrified me most, because it
was the one I found most tempting — I could do nothing. I could
continue my work. Continue maintaining the ruins. Continue being the
caretaker. Continue fulfilling the function that the builders had,
with their incomprehensible foresight, anticipated and provided for.
Continue serving the machine.

Because that was what the Preservation Society had always been. Not a
human institution. Not a product of human culture or human values. A
component. A part of the machine's design. The builders had known —
had predicted, had engineered, had somehow ensured — that when their
structures were found by whatever species eventually settled their
world, that species would preserve them. Would maintain them. Would do,
from reverence or curiosity or the simple bureaucratic instinct to
protect old things, exactly what the machine needed to survive the long
millennia between the builders' departure and its own completion.

The Vandermere Preservation Society was not a human idea. It was an
alien one, planted in the fertile soil of human nature eight thousand
years before the first human set foot on Ashlar, and it had grown
exactly as its planters intended.

I thought about Gannt. My predecessor. The man who had resigned without
explanation after seven years. Had he seen what I was seeing? Had he
reached the same conclusions? Was his sudden departure an act of
cowardice, or an act of the most desperate courage — an attempt to
remove himself from the machine, to stop serving it, to break the chain
of maintenance that had kept it alive?

I searched his records. I found, in the archives, a personal journal
that he had left behind — accidentally, or perhaps deliberately. The
entries from his last months were brief and increasingly disjointed.
One, dated three days before his resignation, read:

     The seam in the central structure is wider today. I measured it.
     0.3 millimeters. It was 0.1 yesterday. The acceleration is
     exponential. I have stopped making repairs to the outer ring.
     I have stopped clearing vegetation. I have stopped doing the
     work. I am trying to let it die.

     It is not dying.

     The vegetation grows over the stones and the stone grows
     through the vegetation. I cleared a patch of moss from
     Structure 4-A three months ago, as part of my regular
     maintenance. The moss grew back. I did not clear it again.
     Today I checked: the stone has grown over the moss. Absorbed
     it. Incorporated it. The biological material has been converted
     into the vitreous substance. The machine is feeding.

     I am leaving. I cannot stop it. I cannot slow it. All I can do
     is remove myself from its mechanism and hope that my absence
     creates a gap it cannot fill.

     It will fill the gap. I know this. But I am leaving anyway.

I read Gannt's journal twice. Then I closed it and sat in the silence
of my office and listened to the faint, subliminal hum that I had
noticed, for the first time, a week ago — so faint that it might have
been the blood in my own ears, except that it pulsed at a rhythm that
was not my heartbeat, and it came from the direction of the ruins, and
it was getting louder.

                               VII.

I made my decision on a Wednesday. The same day of the week, I noted
with no particular significance, that I had first noticed the growth
of Structure 7-C. Wednesdays, it seemed, were days for revelations.

I would try to destroy the central structure.

Not from heroism. Not from principle. From the simple, animal
conviction that whatever the machine was building toward — whatever the
completion of an eight-thousand-year construction project by an extinct
alien civilization was designed to produce — I did not want to be
present for it. And if I could not outrun it, perhaps I could delay it.

I obtained blasting charges from the Millhaven Mining Cooperative, citing
a fictional need to clear rockfall from the pathway to the ruins. The
foreman, a man named Dekker, gave me six crates without asking questions.
Mining people did not ask questions about blasting charges. It was like
asking a carpenter about nails.

I set the charges at night. Six crates, twenty charges per crate, one
hundred and twenty charges arranged at the base of the central spike in
a pattern that — if the demolition manuals I had studied were correct —
would produce a shearing stress sufficient to fracture the structure at
its base and bring the entire hundred-and-forty-meter column down.

The night was dark. No moon. The black pines were silhouettes against a
sky clouded to the color of slate. The ruins were lightless, as they
always were at night, but not silent. The hum was louder now — not in
the way that a sound grows louder, as though its volume had increased,
but in the way that a presence grows louder, as though the thing
producing it had moved closer. The hum was in the ground. It was in the
air. It was in the stone beneath my hands as I placed the charges.

I worked quickly. My hands were steady. Fear has a way, when it reaches
a certain intensity, of circling back to a kind of calm — the calm of
the irrevocable, the peace that comes from having committed to a course
of action that cannot be undone.

I finished placing the charges at 2:00 AM. I connected the detonation
wire. I retreated to the headquarters building, five hundred meters
from the base of the spike, and I connected the wire to the detonator.

I looked at the spike. In the darkness, it was invisible — a column of
black against a sky of black, detectable only by the absence of stars
where it stood. But I could feel it. I could feel the hum. And I could
feel — or imagined that I could feel — the awareness. The slow,
structural, inhuman awareness of a machine that knew, in whatever way
a machine could know, that someone was trying to kill it.

I pressed the detonator.

The explosion was enormous. The night split apart in a roar of light
and sound and concussion that knocked me off my feet and drove the
breath from my lungs and sent a column of fire and pulverized stone
skyward like a volcanic eruption. The ground heaved. The windows of
the headquarters building shattered inward. A rain of stone fragments
pelted the roof and the walls and the ground around me, and for a
long, confused moment I lay on the floor with my arms over my head
and my ears ringing and the taste of dust and explosive in my mouth.

When I raised my head, the sky was full of falling debris and settling
dust, and the place where the central spike had stood was obscured by
a roiling cloud of smoke and particulate. I could see nothing. I could
hear nothing but the ringing in my ears and the patter of falling
stone.

I waited. The dust settled. The smoke cleared.

The spike was intact.

Not undamaged. The base showed scorching and spalling where the charges
had detonated. A section of the surface, perhaps two meters square, had
been cracked and discolored. Fragments of the vitreous stone lay
scattered on the ground, some of them still glowing faintly with
residual heat.

But the structure stood. One hundred and forty meters of black stone,
rising into the night sky, unmarred except for the cosmetic damage at
its base. The explosion that would have toppled a building of comparable
size made of steel and concrete had barely scratched it.

And as I stood there, staring at the spike in the settling dust, I
saw something that extinguished the last spark of hope in my chest as
completely as a boot extinguishes a cigarette.

The cracks were healing.

The spalled surface was — before my eyes, in real time, at a speed
incomparably faster than the glacial growth rate I had measured in the
outer structures — smoothing over. The fractures were closing. The
scorched stone was returning to its original color, its original
texture, its original featureless perfection. The machine was repairing
itself. Not over months or years. Over minutes.

The explosion had not destroyed the machine. It had provoked it.

And the hum — that deep, structural, bone-deep vibration that had been
growing slowly louder for weeks — surged. It rose through the ground
and through the air and through my body like a wave, and the
headquarters building trembled, and the black pines trembled, and the
ground trembled, and the sky itself seemed to tremble, and the seam in
the central spike — the hairline seam that had appeared the day
before — widened.

Not by millimeters. By centimeters. By meters.

The spike was opening.

                               VIII.

I ran.

There is no dignity in what I did next and I will not pretend otherwise.
I ran from the ruins like a woman pursued by wolves, down the mountain
path in the dark, through the black pine forest, through the cold mist
that had begun to rise from the river, running until my lungs burned
and my legs failed and I fell on the trail and lay there, gasping, with
the stones of the path pressing into my cheek and the sound of the
hum — impossibly, inescapably, as loud here as it had been at the base
of the spike — filling the darkness around me.

I lay there for a long time. When I could breathe again, I stood, and
I walked — not ran, walked, because there was no longer any point in
running — the remaining twelve kilometers to the port town of Kellis.

I am in Kellis now. I am in the rented room above the chandler's shop.
The next transport is due in three days. I will be on it.

Behind me, in the mountains, the machine is completing itself. I can
still feel the hum. I suspect I will always be able to feel it. It is
in my bones now, as permanent and as alien as the stone from which it
originates. The seam in the central spike is, I am certain, widening
further. The outer structures are growing faster. The pathways are
connecting. The bridges are reaching. The concentric rings are
tightening, drawing inward, converging on the center, and the whole
vast mechanism is approaching — after eight thousand patient years — the
moment of its completion.

What will happen when it is complete? I do not know. The builders left
no instructions, no manual, no explanation. They built a machine of
dark stone in a valley in the mountains of a world they knew they would
not stay on, and they left, and the machine has been building itself
ever since, aided by the unwitting labor of every person who ever
looked at those beautiful, terrible ruins and thought: these should be
preserved.

Perhaps the machine is benign. Perhaps it will do something wonderful.
Perhaps the builders were benefactors, and their eight-thousand-year
construction project is a gift — a technology, a cure, a revelation —
left for whoever found it, the way a message in a bottle is left for
whoever pulls it from the sea.

Perhaps.

But the hum does not sound benign. The hum sounds like hunger. The hum
sounds like patience reaching its end. The hum sounds like something
that has been waiting for a very long time and is now, at last, about
to stop waiting.

I have done what I can. I have written this account. I am sending
copies to the colonial government, to the university at New Cambridge,
and to this magazine, which published a story by a man named Blackwood
in its last Halloween issue that made me think: here are people who
understand that the universe contains things that should frighten us.

If you are reading this, the transport arrived in time and I am off-
world. If you are reading this and the world of Ashlar still exists,
then perhaps I was wrong. Perhaps the machine is a gift. Perhaps the
hum was just a hum.

But if the world of Ashlar no longer exists — if the coordinates where
it once orbited its gray, indifferent star are empty — then you will
know what the machine was for.

And you will know that we built it. Not the aliens. Not the extinct
civilization that laid the first stones eight thousand years ago. Us.
Every curator, every laborer, every member of the Vandermere
Preservation Society who ever cleared a vine or repaired a stone or
filled a crack — we built it. We were the final stage of construction.
The hands that finished what the builders had begun.

I do not know which thought is more terrible: that the machine might
destroy us, or that it was designed to, and that we helped.

The hum is louder tonight. The walls of this room are vibrating. The
water in the glass on my nightstand is trembling in concentric circles,
and I find myself staring at those circles — rings within rings,
converging on a center — and thinking of the ruins.

The transport comes in three days. I will wait. There is nothing else
to do.

But I will not sleep. I cannot sleep. Not with that sound. Not with
that hum.

Not with the knowledge of what I have helped to build.

                            [THE END]

                     THE JACK-O'-LANTERN NEBULA

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The nebula was not on any chart.

Captain Mara Kelso noticed it first through the forward viewport of the
Doris Mae — a smear of orange light against the black, wide as a
thumbnail held at arm's length, glowing with the soft, diffuse
luminosity of heated gas. It shouldn't have been there. The Doris Mae
was running the Aldebaran-to-Procyon trade corridor, a route Kelso had
flown forty-three times in the past six years, and she knew this
particular stretch of space the way a long-haul trucker knows a
familiar highway. Every star, every landmark, every navigational waypoint
was filed in her memory with the precision of a woman whose livelihood
depended on getting from here to there without surprises.

There were no nebulae on this route. None. The nearest catalogued
emission nebula was NGC 1499, the California Nebula, and that was
parsecs off the corridor, far outside visual range.

"Yates," she said.

Yates was her navigator — a thin, nervous man with a receding hairline
and a prodigious talent for celestial mathematics that was somewhat
undermined by his tendency to worry about everything. He was hunched
over the navigation console, checking their position against the
ephemeris for the third time that watch, which was normal for Yates.

"Captain?"

"What is that?" She pointed.

Yates looked up, squinted through the viewport, and frowned. "That's
not — " He turned to his console and began pulling up star charts.
After a moment, his frown deepened. "There's nothing charted in that
position. Nothing at all."

"I can see it's not charted. I'm asking what it is."

"It looks like a nebula. Emission type, based on the color. Hydrogen-
alpha, probably — that would account for the orange." He paused. "But
there isn't a nebula there."

"And yet."

Kelso turned to the intercom. "Holloway. Bridge."

Holloway was the Doris Mae's engineer — a heavyset woman with close-
cropped gray hair and the calm, unflappable demeanor of someone who had
spent thirty years keeping old ships running and had seen everything
that the universe could throw at a merchant freighter, or believed she
had. She arrived on the bridge two minutes later, wiping her hands on
a rag.

"What's the fuss?"

"Look out the viewport."

Holloway looked. Her expression did not change — Holloway's expression
never changed — but her hands stopped wiping the rag.

"Huh," she said.

"That's an uncharted nebula, approximately seven light-hours off our
starboard quarter. Yates can't find it in any catalogue."

"Could be new. Could be a transient — some stellar event that produced
a gas cloud since the last survey."

"In the last six months? That's the last time I ran this route, and
it wasn't here then."

Holloway shrugged. "The universe does what it wants, Captain. Are we
going around it?"

This was the practical question. The Doris Mae was carrying eight
hundred tons of agricultural machinery bound for the colony on Procyon
IV. The delivery window was tight — fourteen days from departure, and
they were on day nine with a comfortable but not generous margin. Going
around the nebula would add time. Going through it would not, since it
lay almost directly on their course.

"Any reason not to go through?" Kelso asked.

Yates shifted uncomfortably. "We don't know what it is."

"It's a nebula, Yates. Gas and dust. Ships fly through nebulae all
the time."

"Ships fly through charted nebulae all the time. This one isn't
charted. We don't know its composition, its density, its — "

"Yates."

"Captain?"

"It's a gas cloud. We'll fly through it and save four hours. Log it as
uncharted and we'll file a report at Procyon."

Yates looked like he wanted to object further but subsided. Holloway
shrugged again and went back below. Kelso adjusted course three degrees
to starboard to put them on a direct intercept with the nebula.

It was, she thought, the most ordinary decision she had ever made.

She would think about that later.

                               II.

The fourth member of the Doris Mae's crew was Tommy Park, the cargo
handler and general dogsbody — a young man of twenty-four who had
shipped out as a merchant spacer at eighteen because, he had told
Kelso at his interview, "I wanted to see things." He had seen things.
Mostly the insides of cargo holds and the business end of a loading
crane. But he maintained an infectious enthusiasm for the romance of
space travel that the rest of the crew found alternately endearing and
exhausting.

It was Park who first remarked on the face.

They were two hours from the nebula's outer boundary when he drifted
onto the bridge during his off-watch, as he frequently did, to look
through the viewport. The nebula had grown substantially — it now filled
a quarter of the forward view, a great glowing cloud of orange gas with
tendrils and streamers curling at its edges, lit from within by the
light of whatever stars were embedded in its depths.

"Captain," Park said, in the tone of someone who knows he's about to
say something that will make him sound foolish. "Does that look like a
face to you?"

Kelso looked. She had been looking at the nebula on and off for two
hours, and she had not seen a face, but now that Park had mentioned it,
she could not unsee it. Two regions of denser gas, roughly symmetrical,
that could be eyes. A darker strip between them that could be a nose.
A curved band of luminosity below that could be a mouth. The overall
shape — slightly elongated vertically, narrower at the bottom than the
top — that could be the outline of a head.

It was pareidolia, obviously. The same trick of perception that made
people see faces in clouds, in rock formations, in the pattern of
stains on a ceiling tile. The human brain was wired to find faces. It
found them everywhere.

"It's gas, Park."

"I know, Captain. But it looks like a face."

"Gas that happens to look like a face."

"A face that happens to be made of gas."

She almost smiled. "Get off my bridge and get some sleep. We enter the
nebula in two hours and I want everyone rested."

Park went. Kelso looked at the nebula. The face looked back. She turned
her chair and studied her instruments instead.

                               III.

The Doris Mae entered the nebula at 14:00 ship time.

The transition from clear space to nebular interior was gradual — a slow
thickening of the view, the stars dimming and reddening as the gas
density increased around them, the viewport filling with a soft,
ambient orange glow that turned the bridge into something that felt,
absurdly, like a room lit by candlelight. The temperature gauges showed
a slight increase — the gas was warm, heated by the radiation of the
embedded stars, and the ship's hull was absorbing a fraction of that
warmth. Nothing dangerous. Nothing even particularly unusual.

The instruments, however, were another matter.

"Captain." Yates's voice had acquired the particular tight quality it
took on when his worst fears were being confirmed. "I'm getting
anomalous readings."

"What kind of anomalous?"

"Navigation. The star tracker is returning positions that don't match
the ephemeris. I'm getting parallax errors on reference stars — the
computer is telling me that Aldebaran is three degrees off its charted
position, which is obviously impossible."

"Refraction," Holloway said, from the engineering station where she had
installed herself. "The gas is bending the light. Like a lens."

"I know what refraction is, Holloway. I'm correcting for it. The
corrected positions are still off. By a degree and a half."

"Can you navigate?"

"I can dead-reckon from our last good fix. But if the error accumulates,
I'll lose our position. I strongly recommend — "

"Noted," Kelso said. "Holloway, how are the engines?"

"Nominal. Power output is steady. No anomalies on my board." She
paused. "Actually — wait. That's odd."

"What?"

"The hull temperature is oscillating. Not much — half a degree — but
it's cycling. Up, down, up, down. Every thirty seconds or so. Like a
pulse."

Kelso looked at Holloway. Holloway looked at Kelso. Neither of them
said anything.

"It's the gas density," Holloway added, after a moment. "Has to be.
We're flying through regions of varying density, and the thermal load
is fluctuating. It's nothing."

"Right."

"Absolutely nothing."

"Of course."

Park's voice came over the intercom from the cargo hold. "Captain? Is
it just me, or is the ship rocking?"

It wasn't just him. The Doris Mae was experiencing a gentle, rhythmic
oscillation — a sway, side to side, barely perceptible, like a boat on
a long, slow swell. Kelso checked the attitude thrusters. They were
firing intermittently, correcting for the motion, but the motion kept
returning.

"What's causing that?" she asked.

"Gas currents," Holloway said. But she sounded less certain than before.

Kelso unbuckled from her seat and walked to the viewport. The nebula
filled the view — orange gas, streaked with darker bands, illuminated
from within, swirling slowly in patterns that were almost, but not
quite, random. The face was still visible, but it had changed. They
were inside it now, and the perspective was different — they were too
close to see the whole, the way you can't see a hillside when you're
standing on it. But the sense of a face remained. The sense of being
inside a face. Of looking out through the face's eyes at the stars
beyond, dimmed and reddened by the gas.

"Captain." Yates again, and now his voice was not tight but thin. Thin
and stretched, like wire under load. "The ship's log."

"What about it?"

"I was checking the nav entries. The log has entries that I didn't
make."

Kelso crossed to the navigation console and looked over his shoulder.
The ship's log was a standard electronic record — every course change,
every observation, every navigational fix was automatically recorded
with a timestamp. Kelso read the entries.

14:00 — Entered nebula boundary. Visibility reduced. Star tracker
         anomalies noted.
14:07 — Course correction, 0.5 degrees port. Compensating for drift.
14:12 — Hull temperature oscillation detected. Investigating.
14:18 — MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY. Doris Mae, registry MC-7742. Catastrophic
         hull breach, Section 3. All hands lost. God help us.
14:24 — Navigation fix: Position uncertain. Star tracker inoperative.
         Dead reckoning from last known position.
14:29 — The walls are moving. The walls of the ship are breathing.
         We can hear something outside the hull. It is not gas.

Kelso read the entries twice. Then she read them a third time.

"The 14:18 and 14:29 entries," she said. "I didn't log those. You
didn't log those."

"No, ma'am."

"It's currently 14:16. The 14:18 entry is timestamped two minutes
from now."

"Yes, ma'am."

They looked at each other. The bridge was very quiet. The orange light
of the nebula filled the viewport, warm and steady, and the ship
swayed gently on its invisible swell, and the clock on the console
read 14:16:42.

"Those entries haven't happened yet," Kelso said.

"No, ma'am. They haven't."

Kelso's throat was dry. She swallowed. "Is Section 3 intact?"

"Checking." Yates queried the hull integrity sensors. "Section 3 is
nominal. No breaches. No stress indicators. No anomalies."

"The entry says catastrophic hull breach at 14:18. That's in less
than two minutes."

"I know, Captain."

Kelso hit the intercom. "All hands, suit up. Now. Pressure suits,
helmets sealed, emergency stations. Move."

She did not explain. There was no time to explain, and no explanation
that would have made sense. She grabbed her own suit from the locker
behind the command chair and pulled it on, hands moving with the
automatic speed of long practice, sealing the joints, locking the
helmet, feeling the reassuring hiss of pressurization.

14:17:30.

Park's voice on the intercom: "Captain, I'm suited up. What's
happening?"

"Stay in the hold. Seal the bulkhead."

14:17:55.

Holloway, calm as ever: "Suited. Engineering sealed."

14:18:00.

Nothing happened.

14:18:01. 14:18:02. 14:18:03. The seconds ticked by. Kelso stood on
the bridge in her pressure suit, staring at the hull integrity display,
watching the green indicators that represented the structural health
of Section 3 — cargo bay, port side, forward quarter. Green. Green.
Green.

14:18:30. Green. 14:19:00. Green. 14:19:30. Green.

The catastrophic hull breach did not occur.

Kelso exhaled. She looked at Yates. Yates looked at her. His face,
behind the transparent faceplate of his helmet, was the color of old
paper.

"The log entry is still there," he said. "14:18. Catastrophic hull
breach. All hands lost. It's still recorded."

"But it didn't happen."

"No. It didn't happen."

Kelso looked at the log. Below the 14:18 entry, the 14:29 entry still
waited. The walls are moving. We can hear something outside the hull.

It was 14:20.

They had nine minutes.

                               IV.

"We're turning around," Kelso said. "Yates, plot a reciprocal course.
Best speed back to the nebula boundary."

"Already plotted. Reciprocal heading is 180 mark 0. At maximum thrust,
we'll reach the boundary in approximately — " He stopped. He tapped his
console. He tapped it again. "Captain, the navigation is — I can't
determine our position. The star tracker is completely inoperative. Not
anomalous — inoperative. It's not returning any data at all."

"Dead reckoning."

"I can dead-reckon our position at the time we entered the nebula. But
if we've drifted — if the gas currents have altered our course — "

"Give me your best guess and we'll run for it."

Yates gave her a heading. Kelso brought the Doris Mae around, feeling
the old ship shudder as the attitude thrusters fought the slow, strange
swell that was still pushing them side to side, and she advanced the
main engines to full power. The acceleration pressed her back in her
seat. The orange glow of the nebula streamed past the viewport.

14:22. Seven minutes to the next log entry.

"Park," Kelso said on the intercom. "How are you?"

"Fine, Captain. Confused, but fine."

"Stay suited. Stay sealed."

"Captain, what's happening?"

Kelso almost told him. She almost said: the ship's log is recording
events that haven't happened yet, and all of them end badly. But she
looked at the viewport, at the orange gas flowing past, at the slow,
hypnotic, almost organic swirl of the nebula's interior, and she said:
"Just a precaution. Stand by."

14:24. She looked at the hull displays. All green. She looked at the
viewport. Orange. Nothing but orange — no stars, no landmarks, no
indication that they were moving toward the boundary or away from it or
in circles. They were inside the nebula and the nebula was all there
was.

"Holloway. Are we actually moving?"

"Engines are at full thrust. Fuel consumption is consistent with full
thrust. We should be moving at — " A pause. "That's strange."

"What?"

"The acceleration sensors are reading zero. The engines are firing at
full power, and the ship is not accelerating."

"That's not possible."

"I agree. And yet."

14:26. Kelso looked at the log. The 14:29 entry stared back at her.
The walls are moving. We can hear something outside the hull.

She stood up. She walked to the viewport. She looked out.

And she saw her own face looking back.

Not a reflection. Reflections moved when you moved. This face was
still. It was in the nebula — formed from the gas itself, the way the
larger face had been formed, but this one was small, close, precise.
Her face. Her features. Her expression. Staring at her from the other
side of the glass with an expression of absolute, frozen terror.

The face mouthed a word. Kelso could not hear it, but she could read
the lips — her own lips, forming a word she recognized.

Run.

14:27. Behind her, Yates made a sound — not a word, not a scream, just
a sound, the kind of sound a person makes when they have seen something
that their mind refuses to process. She turned.

The ship's log was filling with entries. Not one. Not two. Dozens.
Hundreds. Entries timestamped for every minute from 14:27 to 15:00,
then from 15:00 to 16:00, then from 16:00 onward, the timestamps
accelerating, cascading, filling the screen with text that scrolled
faster than Kelso could read.

She caught fragments.

14:33 — The engines have stopped responding. We are drifting.
14:41 — Something is on the hull. We can hear it moving.
14:55 — The cargo bay is open to vacuum. Park is dead.
15:12 — Holloway's suit has been breached. She is not screaming.
15:28 — I am alone on the bridge. The viewport is covered in something
         dark. I cannot see the nebula anymore. I can hear breathing
         that is not mine.
15:44 — It is inside the ship.
16:00 — [ENTRY BLANK]

The entries stopped at 16:00. Every entry after that was blank. Just
timestamps with no text. As though there was no one left to write
anything.

Kelso stared at the screen. Her hands were shaking inside her gloves.

14:29. She looked up from the screen.

The walls were moving.

It was subtle — a slight contraction, a flexing, as though the hull of
the Doris Mae were made not of steel but of something organic, something
that could breathe. The bulkheads shifted inward by a centimeter, then
back. In. Out. In. Out. In time with the hull temperature oscillation.
In time with the swell.

Like breathing.

And outside the hull — outside the steel skin of the ship, in the
warm orange gas of the nebula — something moved. Not the gas itself.
Something in the gas. Something that brushed against the hull with a
sound like fingertips on glass, a gentle, deliberate, exploratory
touch, as though whatever was out there was feeling the shape of the
ship, tracing its contours, learning its dimensions.

"We have to get out," Kelso said. Her voice was steady. She was
distantly impressed by this. "Yates, I don't care what the instruments
say. Pick a direction and fly."

"Any direction?"

"Any direction that isn't here."

Yates chose a heading. Kelso engaged the engines. The ship did not
accelerate — the sensors still read zero — but the gas outside the
viewport began to move, or the ship began to move through it, and the
orange glow shifted and thickened and thinned in patterns that might
have been natural currents or might have been something else, and the
thing on the hull continued to touch and trace and explore.

They flew for two hours. The nebula did not end. They changed heading
four times. The nebula did not end. They reversed course and flew back
the way they had come, or the way they thought they had come, and the
nebula did not end. It went on and on, orange and warm and breathing,
and the log continued to fill with entries from a future that was
converging on the present with the slow, terrible patience of a tide
coming in.

                               V.

At 16:00, the entries stopped being future and became past.

Kelso noticed it when she checked the log and found that the 14:55
entry — the one that read "Park is dead" — was no longer in the future-
tense font the system used for projected entries. It was in the standard
font. The system had reclassified it from projection to record. As
though it had happened.

"Park," Kelso said on the intercom. "Park, respond."

Silence.

"Park!"

A crackle. Then Park's voice, shaky but alive: "Here, Captain. I'm
here."

The relief hit her like a physical blow. "You're alive."

"Last time I checked. Why wouldn't I be?"

Kelso looked at the log. Park is dead. The entry stared at her in
standard font, recorded, past tense, historical fact. But Park was
alive. She could hear him breathing.

The log was wrong.

Or the log was right, and what it was recording was not this ship.
Not this crew. Not this version of events. But another one — a
parallel possibility, an alternate path, a different outcome playing
out in some adjacent space that the nebula had made visible, the way
the gas made invisible light visible, the way a prism made hidden
colors appear.

"Captain?" Park said. "You're scaring me."

"Stay where you are. Stay suited. Stay alive."

She cut the intercom. She looked at Yates. "The entries in the log.
They're not predictions. They're records of something that happened
to someone else."

Yates looked at her with the expression of a man who has passed beyond
fear into a kind of exhausted bewilderment. "Another ship?"

"Another us. Another Doris Mae that entered this nebula and — " She
gestured at the log. "And didn't make it out."

"How do you know we're the ones that make it out?"

Kelso did not answer, because she did not know.

                               VI.

They found the boundary at 18:33, not by navigation but by luck — or
perhaps by the nebula's choice, though Kelso did not permit herself to
think in those terms. The orange glow began to thin. Stars appeared,
faint and reddened at first, then brighter, sharper, their familiar
patterns reasserting themselves against the black. The swell beneath
the ship gentled and died. The breathing of the walls stopped. The
thing on the hull — whatever it had been — withdrew, its touch sliding
away from the steel like a hand lifting from a table.

The Doris Mae broke free of the nebula at 18:47 and plunged into clear
space, and Kelso pushed the engines to maximum and did not ease them
until the nebula was a small orange smear on the aft monitor, shrinking
by the minute.

She looked at it one last time before it faded from view. The face was
still there — the great, diffuse, impossible face in the gas. But it
had changed. The mouth — the curved band of luminosity that Park had
noticed — was wider now.

It was smiling.

Kelso turned away from the monitor and did not look back.

In the ship's log, the entries from the other Doris Mae — the doomed
one, the one that had not escaped — remained, stubbornly, in standard
font. They were part of the record now. They had happened. Not to this
crew, not on this ship, but somewhere, in some version of events that
the nebula had recorded and played back, they had happened.

The last entry — 16:00, blank, no text — stared from the screen like
an open mouth.

Kelso closed the log.

She looked at her crew. Yates, pale and shaking but alive. Holloway,
calm as granite, already running engine diagnostics. Park, who had come
up from the cargo bay and was standing in the bridge doorway with an
expression of bewildered relief that made him look even younger than
his twenty-four years.

"We don't talk about this," Kelso said.

They looked at her.

"We file a report on the uncharted nebula. Position, approximate size,
spectral characteristics. We recommend it be flagged as a navigation
hazard. We do not mention the log entries. We do not mention the face.
We do not mention any of it."

"Captain — " Yates began.

"Nobody would believe us, Yates. And I'm not sure I want them to. I'm
not sure I want anyone else flying into that thing to check our story."
She paused. "File the report. Deliver the cargo. Go home."

Yates nodded. Holloway nodded. Park, after a moment, nodded too.

Kelso turned back to the viewport. Clear space. Stars. The familiar,
reliable, silent emptiness that she had traveled through for six years
and that she had, until today, considered inert. Passive. Unoccupied.

She did not consider it inert anymore.

Somewhere behind them, the Jack-o'-Lantern Nebula — Park's name for it,
bestowed during the debrief with the sheepish defensiveness of a young
man who knows he's being unscientific — hung in the dark, glowing
orange, smiling its terrible smile.

And somewhere inside it, another Doris Mae drifted in the warm gas,
empty and dark, its log full of horrors, its crew gone, its walls
still breathing.

Kelso flew on. She did not look back.

She never flew that route again.

                            [THE END]

                      THE INHERITANCE OF TEETH

                         by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                               I.

Ruth found the teeth on a Tuesday, which was scavenging day.

She had been working the east quarter of the old city for three weeks
now, picking through the rubble of what had once been a residential
district. The buildings here had been modest — wood-frame houses, two
stories, with porches and small yards. They were gone now, of course.
Everything above the first story was gone. What remained was a low
landscape of broken foundation walls and collapsed basements, overgrown
with the tough, gray-green grass that had colonized the ruins in the
years since the Fall. The grass grew everywhere. It grew through
concrete. It grew through asphalt. It grew through the rusted frames
of automobiles and the shattered glass of windows and the scattered,
sun-bleached bones of people who had not made it to shelter in time.
The grass did not discriminate. It grew.

Ruth's scavenging kit was a canvas bag, a pry bar, and a hand-drawn
map of the sectors she had already searched. She worked methodically,
grid by grid, basement by basement, salvaging anything of use: metal
fittings, lengths of wire, unbroken glass, tools, nails. The community
at Miller's Creek needed all of it. Eighteen months after the Fall,
they were past the point of using up the easy pickings and into the
long, grinding work of rebuilding from scraps.

The basement where she found the teeth was unremarkable from the
outside — a rectangle of crumbling concrete walls, half-filled with
rubble and rainwater, accessible through a gap where the stairs had
collapsed. Ruth climbed down carefully, testing each foothold, and
stood in six inches of cold, silty water, shining her flashlight
around the space.

Shelves. Metal shelves, bolted to the walls, still standing despite
the collapse of everything above them. Sturdy industrial shelving,
the kind you'd find in a warehouse or a well-organized workshop. The
shelves were lined with containers — not the plastic bins or cardboard
boxes she usually found in basements, but metal canisters, uniform in
size, sealed with screw-top lids. Dozens of them. Hundreds.

Ruth picked up the nearest canister and unscrewed the lid.

Teeth.

Human teeth. Small, white, carefully cleaned. Three of them, nestled
in cotton wadding inside the canister. Each tooth had a small paper
tag tied to it with white thread. She held the flashlight close and
read the nearest tag.

     MARGARET ANNE COSGROVE
     Born: April 14, 1989
     Removed: November 2, 2031
     REMEMBER

Ruth set the canister down. She picked up another. Unscrewed the lid.
More teeth. Two this time, with tags. Different names, different dates.
The same word: REMEMBER.

She opened a third. A fourth. A fifth. Teeth. All teeth. All tagged.
All with the word REMEMBER.

She stood in the cold water and the beam of her flashlight and she
looked at the shelves — hundreds of canisters, stretching along three
walls of the basement, floor to ceiling — and she did the arithmetic.
If each canister held two or three teeth, and there were hundreds of
canisters, then there were thousands of teeth in this basement.
Thousands of names. Thousands of dates.

Thousands of people who had wanted to be remembered.

Ruth put the canister back on the shelf. She climbed out of the
basement. She sat on the edge of the foundation wall in the thin
October sunlight, and she thought.

                               II.

She told Cal about it that evening, over dinner.

Dinner was cornbread and beans, which was dinner most nights. Cal had
made it. He was a better cook than Ruth, which was not saying much —
Ruth could burn water, as her mother had observed before the Fall, with
the weary affection of a woman who had long since accepted her
daughter's limitations in the domestic sphere.

Cal listened while she described the basement. He was a good listener —
a quiet man, broad-shouldered, with large, gentle hands that had been
a carpenter's hands before the Fall and were now whatever the community
needed them to be: farmer's hands, builder's hands, medic's hands,
grave-digger's hands. He had been Ruth's partner for two years, a fact
that still surprised her sometimes, not because she didn't love him
but because love in the aftermath of catastrophe seemed like a luxury,
like wearing silk to dig a ditch.

"Thousands?" he said.

"At least. I didn't count."

"And each one labeled."

"Name, birthdate, date the tooth was removed, and the word REMEMBER.
Every one."

Cal chewed his cornbread slowly. He was a slow chewer, a slow eater,
a slow everything. Ruth had learned that this was not a sign of
dullness but of deliberation. Cal did not rush because he had learned
that rushing led to mistakes, and mistakes, in the world after the
Fall, could kill you.

"Before the Fall," he said, "there were people who saved teeth."

"Baby teeth. Parents saving their children's baby teeth."

"Not just baby teeth. Extracted teeth. Wisdom teeth. Teeth pulled by
dentists. Some people kept them. Superstition, maybe. Or sentiment."

"This wasn't sentiment, Cal. This was organized. Industrial shelving.
Uniform containers. Labels. Hundreds of them. Somebody was collecting
teeth on purpose."

"A dentist?"

"Maybe. But the dates on the tags — I looked at several. The oldest
was from 2019. The most recent was from 2034. That's two years before
the Fall. Somebody was collecting teeth for fifteen years."

Cal set down his fork. "You want to go back."

It wasn't a question. He knew her.

"I want to go back."

"Why?"

Ruth looked at him. Through the window of their small house — one of
the six houses that constituted the settlement at Miller's Creek — the
sun was going down over the western fields, painting the sky in shades
of orange and red that would have been beautiful if they hadn't been
caused, at least in part, by the particulate matter that still hung in
the upper atmosphere eighteen months after the bombs.

"Because somebody went to a lot of trouble to save those teeth," she
said. "Somebody labeled them REMEMBER. And I want to know what they
were supposed to remember."

                               III.

She went back the next day, and the day after that, and the day after
that.

The basement yielded its secrets slowly. Ruth worked through the
canisters systematically, cataloguing names, dates, and the number of
teeth in each container. Some canisters held a single tooth. Some held
as many as five. The teeth were in varying condition — some were small
and pristine, clearly baby teeth; others were large, yellowed, cracked,
the teeth of adults who had not enjoyed the best dental care. A few
had fillings. A few had gold crowns.

The names told her nothing. They were ordinary names — the names of
ordinary people, a cross-section of the community that had existed here
before the Fall. Men and women, old and young, common surnames and
uncommon ones. No pattern she could detect.

It was the dates that interested her.

The "Removed" dates — the dates when the teeth had been extracted —
spanned fifteen years, from 2019 to 2034. But they were not evenly
distributed. In the early years, the collections had been sparse: a
handful of teeth per year, as though the project were in its infancy,
a small operation slowly gaining participants. By 2028, the rate had
increased dramatically. By 2031, dozens of teeth were being collected
per month. By 2034, the most recent year, the collection had reached
what appeared to be a peak — hundreds of teeth, representing what must
have been a significant portion of the local population.

Somebody had built a movement. A practice. A community organized around
the collection and preservation of human teeth.

On her fourth visit, Ruth found the journal.

It was in a waterproof metal box on the top shelf, behind a row of
canisters. A hardbound notebook, the kind you could buy at any
stationery store before the Fall, its cover warped but its pages
intact. The handwriting inside was small and precise — a woman's
handwriting, Ruth thought, though she knew that was a assumption she
could not justify.

The first entry was dated March 3, 2019.

     We begin today. Dr. Chen has agreed to provide the teeth from
     her practice -- extractions that would otherwise be disposed of
     as medical waste. Each tooth will be cleaned, labeled, and
     preserved. Each tooth carries, in its enamel and its dentin and
     its pulp, the mineral record of a human life. The calcium laid
     down in childhood. The fluoride from the water supply. The lead
     from old pipes, the mercury from fillings, the trace elements
     absorbed from food and air and soil over a lifetime. A tooth is
     a record. A tooth is a diary written in minerals. A tooth, if
     you know how to read it, tells the story of the body it grew in.

     We call ourselves the Memory Keepers. It is a sentimental name
     and I am not a sentimental woman. But the work we are doing is,
     I think, the most important work anyone has ever done, and it
     deserves a name that reflects its importance.

     We are saving the memory of a species.

     Not in words. Not in photographs. Not in any medium that
     requires a reader, an interpreter, a cultural context to
     decode. We are saving memory in the hardest, most durable
     substance the human body produces. Enamel outlasts bone.
     Enamel outlasts wood, paper, magnetic tape, optical disc. Enamel
     outlasts civilizations. When everything else is dust, the teeth
     remain.

     REMEMBER.

Ruth read the entry three times. Then she sat on the damp basement
floor and read the rest of the journal, all of it, cover to cover,
while the flashlight batteries slowly dimmed and the cold water soaked
through the seat of her pants.

                               IV.

The Memory Keepers, the journal revealed, had started as one woman's
obsession and grown into a community.

The founder — the journal's author — was named Dr. Elena Vasquez. She
was not a dentist but a biochemist, specializing in the analysis of
mineral deposits in biological tissues. She had spent her career
studying the chemical record locked inside human teeth — the layers
of enamel and dentin that accumulated over a lifetime, each layer
recording, in its mineral composition, the environmental conditions
that had prevailed during its formation. Diet. Water quality. Air
quality. Exposure to toxins. Geographic location. A single tooth, in
Dr. Vasquez's hands, could reveal where a person had lived, what they
had eaten, what they had been exposed to, for every year of their life.

The journal documented her growing conviction that teeth were not
merely medical curiosities but archives. Libraries. The most compact,
the most durable, the most information-dense records of human existence
ever produced — produced not by human artifice but by the body itself,
automatically, without effort, without intention, as a byproduct of
the simple act of living.

And they were being thrown away. Every day, in dental offices around
the world, extracted teeth were treated as medical waste. Sterilized
and incinerated. The mineral records of millions of lives, consigned
to the furnace.

Dr. Vasquez had decided to stop the burning.

Her project was modest at first. She convinced a single dentist — Dr.
Chen, a friend from graduate school — to save extracted teeth instead
of destroying them. She cleaned them, labeled them, preserved them. She
stored them in her own basement, in the metal canisters she purchased
from a restaurant supply company. She worked alone for two years.

Then the word spread. A patient of Dr. Chen's, told about the project,
volunteered her own extracted wisdom teeth and told a friend. The friend
told a neighbor. The neighbor told a community group. Within a year,
Dr. Vasquez had a network of seventeen dentists in the area saving teeth
for her. Within five years, the Memory Keepers were a recognized
community organization with three hundred members, a board of directors,
and a newsletter.

The journal documented the growth of the movement with a mixture of
pride and bewilderment. Dr. Vasquez had not expected anyone to care.
She was a biochemist, not a community organizer. But something about
the project touched a nerve — the idea that the body itself contained
a record of its own existence, that this record was being routinely
destroyed, and that a simple act of preservation could save it. People
responded to this. They donated their teeth willingly, even eagerly.
They brought their children's baby teeth. They brought the teeth of
deceased relatives, saved in jewelry boxes and medicine cabinets. They
brought teeth they had found in antique shops and estate sales, the
provenance unknown, the names lost — and Dr. Vasquez labeled these
too, as carefully as the rest, writing "UNKNOWN" where the name
should be and "REMEMBER" where the word always was.

The journal's last entry was dated December 28, 2035. Three months
before the Fall.

     The shelving is full. 4,218 teeth from 1,847 individuals. The
     oldest tooth in the collection is from 1943 -- the baby molar
     of a woman named Harriet Polk, saved by her mother in an
     envelope, donated by her granddaughter seventy-six years later.
     The mineral record in that tooth contains traces of atmospheric
     lead from leaded gasoline, strontium-90 from nuclear testing,
     and calcium from a diet rich in dairy -- the chemical portrait
     of a mid-century American childhood.

     I am ill. Dr. Chen says it is pancreatic cancer. She says I
     have months, not years. I accept this.

     I have asked the board to continue the collection. They have
     agreed. I have asked them to preserve the basement and its
     contents in perpetuity. They have agreed.

     I do not know who will read these teeth. I do not know when.
     I do not know what technology will be required to decode the
     information they contain. But I know this: the teeth will
     outlast us. They will outlast our buildings, our roads, our
     books, our languages. When everything else we have made is gone,
     the teeth will remain, and someone -- someday -- will pick them
     up and read them, and they will know that we were here.

     That we lived. That we ate and drank and breathed. That we
     were born and grew and aged and died. That we were real.

     REMEMBER.

Ruth closed the journal. She sat in the dark, in the cold water, and
she cried.

She cried for Dr. Elena Vasquez, who had died before the Fall and
been spared its horrors. She cried for the 1,847 people whose teeth
were on these shelves, most of whom were certainly dead. She cried for
herself, and for Cal, and for the eighteen people at Miller's Creek who
were alive and trying to stay that way. She cried because somebody had
known. Not about the Fall specifically — Dr. Vasquez had not been a
prophet. But somebody had known that civilizations were fragile, that
records were fragile, that memory was fragile, and that the hardest
substance the body produced might be the only thing that survived.

She cried because somebody had cared enough to try.

                               V.

She brought the journal back to Miller's Creek and read it aloud at
the evening gathering.

The community listened in silence. Eighteen people, sitting on benches
and overturned buckets in the common room of the largest house, eating
their cornbread and beans, listening to the story of a dead woman who
had collected teeth.

When Ruth finished reading, the silence held for a long time.

Then Martha Reeves — the oldest member of the community, a former
schoolteacher in her late sixties who had survived the Fall by hiding
in a root cellar for three weeks — said, in her quiet, firm voice:

"We should keep doing it."

Ruth looked at her. "Keep doing what?"

"Collecting teeth. Preserving them. This woman was right. The teeth
will outlast everything else. If anyone comes after us — if anyone
survives what's coming — the teeth will be there. And they'll know."

"Know what?"

Martha looked at her with the patient expression of a teacher who has
asked a question whose answer is obvious.

"That we were here."

The room was quiet. Outside, the wind moved through the gray-green
grass that covered everything, and the last light of the day faded
from the sky, and somewhere in the distance a dog barked — one of the
feral dogs that roamed the ruins, descendants of pets that had
survived the Fall and gone wild.

"We don't have a dentist," Cal said, practically.

"We have pliers," Martha said. "And we have teeth that fall out on
their own. Baby teeth. Teeth that come loose from poor nutrition. Teeth
that break." She paused. "We have the teeth of the dead."

This last statement hung in the air. The community at Miller's Creek
had buried eleven people since its founding — four to radiation sickness,
two to infected wounds, three to exposure, one to a fall from a
damaged roof, and one to simple, stubborn despair. They were buried in
the field behind the houses, under crosses made from scrap wood.

"We didn't save their teeth," Cal said.

"No. But we can start now."

Ruth looked around the room. She saw faces that were tired, thin,
weathered by hardship and grief and the relentless work of survival.
She saw people who had lost everything — homes, families, the
civilization they had been born into — and who had rebuilt, painstakingly,
from the wreckage. She saw people who understood, in their bones, what
Dr. Vasquez had understood in her laboratory: that the most important
thing was not to survive but to be remembered.

"All in favor," she said.

Every hand went up.

                               VI.

They began the next day.

Ruth returned to the basement and carried back twenty of the empty
canisters, washed and dried, along with cotton wadding and white thread
for tags. She set up a shelf in the common room — a single plank of
salvaged wood, mounted on the wall at eye level, where the canisters
would be visible to everyone who entered.

Martha donated the first tooth. It had been loose for weeks — a molar,
cracked and gray, a casualty of the poor nutrition that plagued them
all. She pulled it herself, with a pair of pliers, in the common room,
with the community watching. The pain was brief. The blood was bright.
She dropped the tooth into a canister, and Ruth tagged it:

     MARTHA AGNES REEVES
     Born: February 11, 1987
     Removed: October 19, 2037
     REMEMBER

Martha held the canister in both hands and looked at the tooth inside
it — that small, gray, ruined bit of calcium and enamel, tagged with
her name and her dates and the word that Dr. Vasquez had chosen as the
project's single, irreducible imperative.

"It's a piece of me," Martha said. "A real, physical piece. And it'll
last a thousand years."

"Longer," Ruth said. "Enamel lasts longer than anything."

Martha nodded. She placed the canister on the shelf. She stepped back.
And then she did something that Ruth had not expected and that made,
in the cold common room of a ruined world, a warmth that had nothing
to do with temperature.

She smiled.

Others followed. Over the following weeks, as teeth came loose from
gums weakened by malnutrition, as baby teeth fell from the mouths of
the community's three children, as an infected molar was pulled from
the jaw of a man named Thomas with the pliers and a slug of salvaged
whiskey and a good deal of profanity, the shelf in the common room
filled.

Each tooth was cleaned. Each tooth was tagged. Each tooth was placed
in its canister and set on the shelf with the same deliberate care
that Dr. Vasquez had given to the first tooth in her collection, sixteen
years before, in a world that no longer existed.

The shelf became, without anyone deciding it should, the heart of the
community. People paused before it. They read the tags. They touched
the canisters. The children, too young to understand the significance,
understood that the shelf was important — that the small metal
containers held something precious, something that mattered, something
that the adults treated with a reverence they did not show to any other
object in their scavenged, improvised lives.

It was grotesque, Ruth sometimes thought. A shelf of teeth. The
preserved dental remnants of a community of survivors, displayed like
trophies or relics. Grotesque.

And beautiful.

Because what the teeth represented was not the body but the person.
Each tooth was a life — a name, a date, a chemical record of
everything that person had eaten and drunk and breathed, encoded in
the hardest substance the body could produce and preserved against the
day when someone, somewhere, would pick it up and read it and know
that this person had existed.

Ruth stood before the shelf one evening, after the others had gone to
bed, and she looked at the canisters, and she thought about the future.
Not the near future — the uncertain, frightening, day-to-day future of
survival in the ruins. The far future. The future in which the grass
had covered everything, the ruins had crumbled to dust, the names of
cities and nations had been forgotten, the very language Ruth spoke had
evolved beyond recognition or died entirely.

In that future, the teeth would still be there. In their canisters, on
their shelf, in the remains of a small house in a place that had once
been called Miller's Creek, the teeth would endure. And someone would
find them. And they would read the tags — or puzzle over them, as Ruth
had puzzled over the earliest tags in Dr. Vasquez's collection, trying
to understand the language, the naming conventions, the significance
of the dates.

And they would see the word REMEMBER.

And even if they could not read it — even if the alphabet was lost,
the language dead, the meaning of every other word on the tag
incomprehensible — the teeth themselves would speak. In the universal
language of calcium and enamel and mineral record. In the language of
the body. In the language of existence.

We were here. We lived. We were real.

Remember.

Ruth touched the nearest canister. It was cold. The tooth inside it
was small and white — a baby tooth, donated by six-year-old James,
who had presented it to her with the solemn pride of a child who knows
he is contributing to something important.

She left her hand on the canister for a moment. Then she went to bed.

Outside, the wind moved through the ruins, and the grass grew, and the
teeth endured.

                            [THE END]

                            NIGHTWATCH

                       by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

There were supposed to be four of them on nightwatch.

Greer knew this because he'd written the duty roster himself, same as
he did every week, in the same black notebook he'd been using since he
took over as station chief of Relay Point Kappa six months ago. Four
names, four shifts, four bunks, four meal tickets. Greer, Halloran,
Polk, and Chen. That was the crew. That was the whole crew. Had been
the whole crew since they'd rotated in at the start of the quarter.

So why were there five chairs occupied in the mess?

He stood in the doorway and counted. One: Halloran, the comm tech,
hunched over a mug of coffee at the far end of the table, his red
hair sticking up at the angles it always stuck up when he'd been
sleeping on his face. Two: Polk, the systems engineer, sitting straight-
backed in the middle of the table with the posture of a woman who'd
done twelve years in the Navy and never let her spine forget it.
Three: Chen, the youngest of them, the electronics specialist, who
was eating a sandwich and reading a technical manual, as Chen always
seemed to be eating a sandwich and reading a technical manual. Four:
Greer himself, standing in the doorway, not yet seated.

Five: somebody else.

The somebody else was sitting at the end of the table nearest the
door. Male. Medium build. Dark hair, cut short. Wearing a standard-
issue relay station jumpsuit — charcoal gray, with the Consolidated
Relay Service patch on the shoulder. Eating a bowl of reconstituted
soup. Looking for all the world like he belonged there.

Greer stared at him. The man did not look up.

"Morning," Greer said, to the room in general.

"Morning, Chief," said Halloran.

Polk nodded. Chen glanced up from his manual, nodded, and went back to
reading.

The fifth person continued eating his soup.

Greer walked to the coffee dispenser, filled a mug, and sat down in
his usual spot — third chair from the left, between Polk and Chen. He
took a sip. The coffee was terrible, as it always was. Relay Point
Kappa was a small station — four bunks, a mess, a comm center, a power
room, and an observation dome, all bolted together and hung in the void
at the midpoint of the Aldebaran relay chain, 4.7 light-years from the
nearest inhabited world. The supply ships came every eight weeks. The
coffee was always stale by week three.

He looked at the fifth person again. The man was eating his soup with
the unhurried calm of someone who had eaten many bowls of soup in this
mess hall, at this table, in this chair.

"Hey," Greer said. "Who are you?"

The man looked up. He had an ordinary face. Brown eyes. A nose that had
been broken at some point and set slightly off-center. A small scar
on his chin. The kind of face you'd see in a crowd and forget
immediately.

"Dane," the man said. "Second shift comm."

"We don't have a second shift comm. Halloran's our only comm tech."

"Right, Halloran's first shift. I'm second."

Greer looked at Halloran. "You know this guy?"

Halloran frowned. He looked at the man — at Dane — with the squinting
concentration of someone trying to place a face. "Yeah," he said,
slowly. "Yeah, I — sure. Dane. Second shift."

"Halloran, we don't have a second shift. We have four people on this
station."

"Five," Halloran said. He was still frowning, but the frown was
changing — shifting from puzzlement to confusion, the confusion of a
man who can see two contradictory things simultaneously and cannot
decide which one is real. "Five. You, me, Polk, Chen, and Dane.
That's the crew."

Greer looked at Polk. "Polk?"

Polk was looking at Dane with an expression that Greer couldn't read.
Her face was still, her jaw set, her eyes narrow. She looked like she
was trying to solve an equation.

"Five," she said. "There are five of us."

"Chen?"

Chen had put down his sandwich. He was looking at Dane, then at Greer,
then at Dane again. "I — yeah. Five. That's right, isn't it?"

No, Greer wanted to say. No, it is not right. There are four of us.
There have always been four of us. I wrote the duty roster. I signed
the crew manifest. I checked the bunks. Four names, four people, four
everything. This man — this Dane — was not here yesterday. He was not
here an hour ago. He was not here when I went to sleep last night. He
is here now, eating soup in my mess hall, wearing a station jumpsuit,
and my entire crew is telling me he belongs here.

But the words didn't come. Something stopped them — not a physical
impediment, not a hand over his mouth, but something more subtle and
more unsettling. A hesitation. A wobble in his certainty. Because when
he looked at Dane — really looked at him, focused on his face, his
posture, his presence in the room — something in Greer's brain produced
a faint, insistent signal that said: yes. He is supposed to be here.
You know him. You have always known him.

Greer did not trust this signal. He did not trust it for one second.
But he felt it, and the feeling was strong, and the gap between knowing
something was wrong and being able to say what was wrong suddenly felt
very wide.

"Finish your breakfast," Greer said. "Shift starts in twenty minutes."

He left the mess. He went to his quarters. He opened his black notebook
and looked at the duty roster.

Five names.

Greer, Halloran, Polk, Chen, Dane.

In his own handwriting.

He stared at it. He turned back a page. The previous week's roster.
Five names. The same five. He turned back another page. Five names.
Another. Five. All the way back to the beginning of the quarter, six
months ago, every roster, every page — five names, five people, five
members of the crew of Relay Point Kappa.

But there were only four bunks.

                               II.

He checked the bunks.

There were five.

The fifth bunk was in the corner of the bunk room that Greer could have
sworn, an hour ago, had been empty — a dead space between the wall and
the air recycler, too small for a bunk. It was not too small for a bunk.
There was a bunk there. Standard-issue, same as the other four, with a
gray blanket and a flat pillow and a name stenciled on the frame: DANE.

The blanket was rumpled. The pillow bore the impression of a head. The
bunk had been slept in.

Greer stood in the bunk room and felt the floor tilt beneath him — not
physically, but cognitively, the nauseating sensation of a mind that
can no longer trust its own inventory of reality. He knew — knew with
absolute, bone-deep certainty — that there had been four bunks in this
room yesterday. Four bunks, four lockers, four sets of personal effects.
He knew this because he had counted them, as he counted everything on
the station, as part of the daily inspection routine that was his
habit and his pride.

Four. Not five. Four.

And yet here were five bunks, five lockers, five names on the frames,
five sets of personal effects on the shelves. Dane's locker contained
a shaving kit, three paperback novels (science fiction, all of them,
with lurid covers), a photograph of a woman who might have been a
wife or a sister, and a small wooden chess set. Ordinary things.
Personal things. Things that belonged to a person who had been living
on this station for months.

Greer opened the locker beside Dane's — his own locker — and checked
its contents. Everything was where he'd left it. His notebook. His
spare jumpsuit. His photograph of Margaret. His flask of bourbon,
technically against regulations, practically universal on relay stations.
Nothing was out of place. Nothing had been moved. The only thing that
had changed was the addition of a fifth locker, a fifth bunk, a fifth
person, inserted into the fabric of the station as neatly and
seamlessly as a word added to a sentence — so naturally that the
sentence still read correctly, and only someone who remembered the
original text could detect the alteration.

Greer remembered the original text. He was sure of this. He was almost
sure.

He went to the comm center.

                               III.

The comm center was the heart of Relay Point Kappa — a small room
packed with communications equipment, dominated by a bank of relay
transceivers that received, amplified, and retransmitted the
interstellar radio signals that connected the colonies of the
Aldebaran sector to each other and to Earth. The work was routine and
endless: monitoring signal strength, adjusting frequencies, logging
traffic, maintaining the equipment. It was the kind of work that
drove some people mad and suited others perfectly. Greer was suited
for it. He liked routine. He liked counting things. He liked knowing
that everything was where it should be.

Halloran was on shift, monitoring the boards with the relaxed attention
of a man who had been doing this job for years. The boards were green.
Everything was nominal.

"Halloran," Greer said.

"Chief?"

"How long has Dane been on the station?"

Halloran's brow furrowed. "Since the start of the quarter. Same as the
rest of us. You assigned him second shift comm. Don't you remember?"

"I'm asking you what you remember."

"I remember him being here. Since the beginning." The furrow deepened.
"Why are you asking, Chief? Is something wrong?"

Greer almost said yes. He almost said: there is a person on this
station who did not exist yesterday, and now he has always existed,
and my duty roster has been rewritten and my bunk room has been
rearranged and my entire crew's memory has been altered, and I am
either going mad or something very wrong is happening.

He didn't say it. Instead he said: "Nothing's wrong. Just doing a
crew check."

He left the comm center and went to the observation dome.

                               IV.

The dome was the only part of the station with a direct visual on
open space. A transparent hemisphere mounted on the station's dorsal
surface, reinforced against micrometeorites, and accessible by a
ladder from the main corridor. Greer went up there when he needed to
think. The view helped. From the dome, you could see the relay
station's solar panels extending like wings on either side, the
antenna array bristling below, and beyond all of it — nothing. Just
space. Stars. The cold, clean, uncomplicated void.

Dane was in the dome.

He was sitting in the observation chair — the single chair bolted to
the floor in the center of the dome — looking up at the stars with the
idle, contemplative expression of a man enjoying a quiet moment. He
turned when Greer's head appeared through the hatch.

"Chief," he said. "Nice up here, isn't it?"

Greer climbed into the dome. He stood a few feet from Dane and looked
at him. The man looked solid. Real. He cast a shadow in the starlight.
His jumpsuit had a coffee stain on the left sleeve. His boots were
scuffed. These were not the details of an illusion.

"Dane," Greer said. "Where did you come from?"

"Same place as everyone else. I rotated in at the start of the quarter.
Supply ship brought me out. You met me at the airlock." He paused.
"Are you feeling all right, Chief?"

"I'm feeling fine."

"You seem a little off."

"I'm fine." Greer sat down on the edge of the hatch, his feet dangling
into the corridor below. "Tell me about yourself, Dane. Family? Where'd
you grow up?"

Dane smiled. It was an ordinary smile. "Grew up on Luna. Copernicus
settlement. Dad was a mining engineer. Mom taught school. I did two
years at the comm academy on Phobos, then joined the relay service.
This is my third posting." He shrugged. "Not much to tell."

It was all perfectly ordinary. Perfectly plausible. Perfectly detailed.
The kind of backstory that a real person would have — layered, specific,
consistent. Not the vague generalities of a fabrication but the
textured particulars of a lived life.

And Greer didn't believe a word of it.

"Have you ever noticed," Greer said, slowly, "anything strange about
this station?"

"Strange how?"

"Things that don't add up. Things that seem wrong but nobody else
notices."

Dane looked at him for a long moment. His expression was calm, open,
unremarkable. His brown eyes held Greer's without flinching.

"No," he said. "Everything seems normal to me."

"Right," Greer said. "Normal."

He went back down the ladder. He went to his quarters. He sat on his
bunk and opened his notebook and stared at the duty roster — five
names, in his own handwriting, as familiar and as alien as a face in
a dream.

And he made a decision. He was going to watch Dane. He was going to
watch him every hour of every day, without sleeping if necessary, until
he understood what the man was and where he had come from and why
Greer was the only person on the station who could feel the wrongness
of his presence like a splinter under the skin.

                               V.

Three days passed. Dane did nothing unusual.

He worked his shifts in the comm center. He ate his meals in the mess.
He slept in his bunk. He read his science fiction paperbacks. He played
chess against Chen in the evenings, and he usually lost, because Chen
was very good at chess and Dane was only mediocre. He told jokes that
were mildly funny. He hummed off-key while he worked. He left the
bathroom a little messier than was strictly considerate, a habit that
annoyed Polk and that she mentioned, with military precision, at
every opportunity.

He was, in every observable respect, a normal human being living a
normal life on a normal relay station. He had habits, preferences,
quirks. He had opinions about the food (negative) and the coffee
(worse) and the entertainment options (nonexistent). He had a talent
for repairing the atmospheric scrubbers that bordered on instinctive.
He had a small, endearing habit of cracking his knuckles before sitting
down at the comm board.

And yet.

Greer watched. He catalogued. He kept notes in his black notebook —
not the official duty log but a separate section, hidden in the back,
where he recorded his observations in a kind of desperate shorthand
that he knew would look, to anyone else, like the ravings of a paranoid.

     Day 1: Dane present at all meals. Interacts normally with
     crew. No anomalous behavior. But — when he turns to leave a
     room, there is a moment, less than a second, when his shadow
     doesn't move with him. It stays. Just for an instant. Then it
     catches up.

     Day 2: Dane on shift. Working the comm board. I stood behind
     him for twenty minutes, watching. His hands move correctly.
     His adjustments are accurate. He knows the equipment. But his
     fingers are too long. I measured them with my eyes, against
     the keyboard spacing. His fingers are longer than they should
     be for a man of his size. Not by much. But enough.

     Day 3: Watched Dane sleep. Sat in the bunk room for four hours
     after lights out. He breathes. He shifts in his sleep. He
     mutters. All normal. But he does not dream. I know this because
     his eyes do not move behind his lids. No REM. No dreaming.
     Four hours of sleep and not one dream.

Was this evidence? Or was it the pattern-seeking of a frightened mind,
finding anomalies where none existed, constructing a conspiracy from
the raw material of ordinary imperfections?

Greer didn't know. He was losing confidence in his own perceptions.
The certainty that had been solid three days ago — the absolute, gut-
level knowledge that Dane did not belong — was eroding, worn down by
the relentless normality of the man's behavior. Every hour Dane spent
being ordinary was an hour that made Greer feel less certain and more
crazy.

And that, Greer thought, might be the point.

                               VI.

On the fourth day, Greer went to Polk.

Polk was in the power room, running diagnostics on the reactor, her
hands moving over the control panels with the practiced efficiency of
a woman who had spent a career maintaining systems that could kill
everyone on board if they malfunctioned. She looked up when Greer
entered.

"Chief."

"Polk, I need to ask you something, and I need you to think carefully
before you answer."

"All right."

"How many people are on this station?"

She blinked. "Five."

"Has it always been five?"

"Yes." She hesitated. The hesitation was tiny — a fractional pause, a
momentary hitch in the smooth flow of her certainty — but Greer saw
it, and he seized on it the way a drowning man seizes a rope.

"You hesitated."

"I didn't — "

"You did. You hesitated. Something about the question bothered you.
What was it?"

Polk was quiet for a moment. She set down the diagnostic tool she'd
been holding and looked at Greer with an expression that was, for
the first time, uncertain.

"It's the bunks," she said.

"What about the bunks?"

"I know there are five bunks. I can see five bunks. I can count them.
But when I close my eyes and try to picture the bunk room, I see
four. I always see four. And then I open my eyes and there are five,
and I can't — I can't figure out which picture is right."

Greer felt a rush of relief so powerful it almost buckled his knees.
He was not alone. He was not crazy. Polk felt it too — the wrongness,
the discrepancy, the splinter.

"It's Dane," he said. "Dane is the fifth. He wasn't here before.
Something put him here."

"Something."

"I don't know what. I don't know how. But he's not supposed to be
here, Polk. He was added."

Polk was quiet for a long time. The reactor hummed behind her — a
low, steady thrum that was the heartbeat of the station.

"Added by what?" she asked.

"I don't know."

"For what purpose?"

"I don't know that either."

"Then what do we do?"

Greer had thought about this. He had thought about nothing else for
four days. "We watch. We wait. And we don't let him know that we
know."

"Do the others know?"

"Halloran and Chen think he's always been here. They don't feel the
wrongness. We're the only ones."

Polk nodded slowly. "And if watching and waiting doesn't get us
anywhere?"

"Then we'll try something else."

"What?"

Greer looked at her. "I'm working on it."

                               VII.

On the sixth day, there were six chairs occupied in the mess.

Greer walked in and counted. Halloran. Polk. Chen. Dane. Himself, in
the doorway. And a woman he had never seen before, sitting next to
Dane, eating scrambled eggs from a reconstituted packet. She was small,
dark-haired, wearing a station jumpsuit. She looked up and smiled at
him.

"Morning, Chief."

Greer's blood turned to ice.

He looked at Polk. Polk was staring at the woman with the expression
of a person who has just watched the ground open beneath her feet.
She felt it. She saw it. The wrongness had doubled.

Halloran and Chen were eating, unconcerned. Dane was eating,
unconcerned. The woman was eating, unconcerned.

"Sorry," Greer said, forcing the words through a throat that had
gone dry as dust. "Remind me of your name."

"Vasquez," the woman said. "Environmental systems. I'm hurt, Chief —
we've been out here six months and you've forgotten my name?" She
laughed. It was a warm, natural laugh.

Six people. Six chairs. Six bunks, Greer knew without checking. Six
names on the duty roster, in his own handwriting. Six people who had
always been here, who had rotated in at the start of the quarter,
who had been the crew of Relay Point Kappa for six months.

Except that they hadn't.

Greer sat down. He drank his coffee. He did not taste it. He looked
at Dane, who was cracking his knuckles before picking up his fork.
He looked at Vasquez, who was reading a technical manual with the
same absorbed concentration that Chen always brought to his reading.
He looked at Polk, who was staring at her plate with the thousand-
yard gaze of someone whose reality was coming apart at the seams.

After breakfast, Greer went to his quarters. He opened his notebook.
He turned past the duty roster — six names, six shifts — and went to
his hidden notes.

He wrote:

     Day 6. There are six of us now. Vasquez appeared this morning.
     Environmental systems. The crew accepts her presence without
     question. Polk and I are the only ones who see the wrongness.

     The pattern is clear. It is adding itself to us. One at a time.
     Fitting in. Making room. Rewriting the records, the memories,
     the physical evidence — bunks, chairs, rosters — so that each
     new addition seems to have always been present.

     I do not know what it is. I do not know why it is doing this.
     I do not know how many more times it can add itself before
     the station cannot hold any more, or before the wrongness
     becomes visible to everyone, or before something breaks.

     I do not know if it matters. I do not know if anything I can do
     will make a difference. But I will keep watching. I will keep
     counting. I will keep my hand on the number, because the number
     is all I have.

     There were four of us.

     Now there are six.

     Tomorrow there may be seven.

He closed the notebook. He placed it in his locker. He looked at the
bunk room — six bunks, six lockers, six names on the frames.

And in the corridor, he heard footsteps. More than six sets. Moving
through the station like heartbeats. Like breaths. Like the slow,
patient addition of digits to a number that should not be growing.

Greer listened. He counted.

He kept counting.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         THE SEANCE MACHINE

                        by Phyllis Crenshaw

================================================================================

                               I.

The machine looked, to Dr. Maren Osgood's professional embarrassment,
like something from a carnival sideshow. Copper coils wrapped around a
central cylinder of blown glass. Vacuum tubes glowed in their sockets
like votive candles. A tangle of wires ran from the base to a
phonograph horn mounted on a brass swivel, and the whole apparatus sat
on a wooden table that had, until last Tuesday, held her collection of
potted violets.

The violets were now on the kitchen windowsill. They were doing better
there, actually. This was the only unambiguous improvement the machine
had produced.

"It's not a seance machine," she said, for what she estimated was the
fourteenth time, to Dr. Calvin Pryce, who stood in the doorway of her
laboratory -- her living room, really, but she had taken to calling it
her laboratory because it made her feel less ridiculous about the
violets. "It's a temporally retroactive consciousness extraction
device."

"That," Pryce said, "is exactly what a person who had built a seance
machine would say."

Pryce was a philosopher from Yale, which meant he was professionally
obligated to be difficult. He was a tall, thin man with an unruly mop
of graying hair and eyebrows that seemed to operate independently of
each other -- one perpetually raised in skepticism, the other drawn
down in concentration. He had come to her house in New Haven on the
recommendation of a mutual friend at the university, who had described
Maren's project as "either the most important scientific breakthrough
since the transistor or the most elaborate nervous breakdown in the
history of the physics department."

"The principle is quite simple," Maren said, pulling a rolling
blackboard from behind the couch. The blackboard was covered in
equations that she had been refining for the better part of two years.
"Consciousness is not a product of the brain. It is a product of the
brain's relationship to time. The brain generates consciousness the way
a radio generates -- no, receives -- a signal. The signal exists
independently of the receiver."

"This is the part where I'm supposed to object that you're smuggling
in dualism."

"And this is the part where I point out that it isn't dualism if the
signal has a physical substrate. The substrate is temporal. Consciousness
is a standing wave in the temporal field -- a resonance pattern created
by the brain's interaction with the forward flow of time."

Pryce's skeptical eyebrow ascended another quarter inch. "Go on."

"At the moment of death, the brain ceases to interact with the temporal
field. The standing wave collapses. Consciousness dissipates. But --
and this is the critical insight -- it doesn't dissipate instantly. There
is a window. A very brief window, approximately forty-seven seconds
before clinical death, during which the standing wave begins to
decouple from the temporal substrate. During that window, the wave
is -- how shall I put this -- loose. Unanchored. It can be caught."

"Caught."

"Caught. Redirected. Pulled forward along the temporal axis and
re-anchored in the present. The machine generates a resonance field
that matches the decoupling frequency of the dying consciousness and
draws it forward through time to our present moment."

Pryce looked at the machine. He looked at the equations on the
blackboard. He looked at Maren, who was a small, sharp-featured woman
of forty-three with the curly red hair and rapid speech patterns of a
person who was always three thoughts ahead of her own sentences.

"You're telling me," he said carefully, "that this machine reaches
backward through time to the moment before a person dies, grabs their
consciousness, and pulls it into the present."

"In essence, yes."

"And the consciousness arrives here. In this room. In your living room
in New Haven, Connecticut."

"Well, it arrives in proximity to the resonance field. Which is
generated by the machine. Which is in my living room. So yes."

"And you've done this."

Maren paused. This was the part of the conversation she had been
dreading, because the truth was both less dramatic and more disturbing
than Pryce probably expected.

"Three times," she said.

                               * * *

The first time had been an accident. This was the fact that Maren found
most philosophically troubling, and she was a woman who had built a
machine that pulled the dead through time, so her threshold for
philosophical trouble was high.

She had been testing the resonance field at low power on a Tuesday
evening in March. She had not expected anything to happen. The
mathematics predicted that a minimum threshold of field strength was
required before any decoupling consciousness could be captured, and she
had calibrated her test to operate well below that threshold. She was
merely mapping the field's characteristics, taking measurements,
plotting data points.

At 9:47 PM, the phonograph horn had begun to speak.

The voice was thin, scratchy, and recognizably human. It spoke in
short, clipped sentences with a faint accent that Maren later
identified as Hungarian. It said:

"Where is this? I was -- it was the hospital. The pain in my chest.
Where is this?"

Maren had dropped her clipboard. She had stared at the phonograph horn,
which vibrated slightly as the voice emerged, and felt the hairs on
the back of her neck stand up in a way that she had previously
associated only with poorly grounded electrical equipment.

"Who is this?" she had asked, because she was a scientist and
observation was her first instinct.

"My name is Istvan Molnar. I am -- I was -- where is this? The light
is strange. I cannot see anything. I can hear you but I cannot see."

"You're in New Haven, Connecticut. The year is 1955. Can you tell me
what you last remember?"

There had been a long silence. Then:

"I was in the hospital. Beth Israel. New York. The pain was very bad.
The doctor -- Dr. Feldstein -- he was standing over me and his face was
-- I could see from his face that it was bad. And then there was a
feeling of -- of pulling. Like being pulled through a very narrow
space. And now I am here, wherever here is, and I cannot see, and the
pain is gone."

"Mr. Molnar, can you tell me the date? The date you were in the
hospital?"

"March the fourteenth. Nineteen fifty-five. Tuesday."

Maren had looked at her calendar. It was March 14th, 1955. A Tuesday.
The machine was pulling a consciousness from today -- from earlier
today, or perhaps from this very moment, she could not yet determine
the temporal precision -- from the moment before a man named Istvan
Molnar died in a hospital in New York.

"Mr. Molnar," she had said, very carefully, "I need to tell you
something. I believe that you have died. Or rather, that you are in
the process of dying, and that a machine I have built has intercepted
your consciousness and pulled it forward to --"

The phonograph horn went silent. The field readings on her instruments
dropped to zero. The vacuum tubes dimmed and then brightened again.

Istvan Molnar was gone.

Later that night, unable to sleep, Maren had called a friend at
Columbia Medical Center and asked her to check the death records at
Beth Israel Hospital in New York. A patient named Istvan Molnar, age
sixty-seven, had died of cardiac arrest at 9:43 PM on March 14th,
1955. Four minutes before his voice emerged from Maren's phonograph
horn.

The forty-seven-second window was, it appeared, not a fixed value.
It was a minimum. In some cases, the decoupling process took longer.

Maren had sat at her kitchen table for a long time, drinking cold
coffee and thinking about what she had done.

                               II.

"And the other two times?" Pryce asked. He had taken a seat in the
armchair that Maren kept in the corner of the laboratory for exactly
this purpose -- the purpose of accommodating visitors who needed to sit
down suddenly. Most of her visitors, upon hearing about the machine,
needed to sit down suddenly.

"The second was deliberate," Maren said. "I increased the field
strength and attempted to target a specific decoupling event. This
required knowing in advance that someone was about to die, which
presented obvious logistical and ethical challenges. I solved the
logistical problem by monitoring hospital radio frequencies -- there are
certain emergency codes that indicate a patient is in extremis. I
solved the ethical problem by not thinking about it too carefully."

"An approach with a proud tradition in experimental science."

"Quite. On April the third, I detected a code from New Haven Hospital
-- a patient in cardiac failure, fourth floor. I activated the machine
at full power and tuned the resonance field to the approximate
frequency I had recorded during the Molnar event."

"And?"

"And a woman named Dorothy Alcott appeared. Or rather, her
consciousness appeared. Projected through the phonograph horn. She was
seventy-one years old, a retired schoolteacher, and she was dying of
congestive heart failure."

"Was she disoriented? Frightened?"

"She was furious."

Pryce's eyebrows synchronized for the first time, both rising in
surprise. "Furious?"

"She knew she was dying. She had known for weeks. She had made her
peace with it. She had said her goodbyes. She had, as she put it,
'gotten her house in order.' And then, at the last moment, something
had grabbed her and pulled her sideways into a stranger's living room
in what she described as 'the most presumptuous act of rudeness I have
encountered in seventy-one years of living.'"

Pryce let out a sound that was halfway between a laugh and a cough.

"She lectured me for twelve minutes," Maren continued. "She told me
that I had no right to interfere with her death, that dying was a
private matter, and that if I had any manners at all I would put her
back where I found her."

"Can you do that? Put them back?"

"No. The decoupling is a one-way process. Once the consciousness is
extracted from the temporal window, it cannot be reinserted. Mrs.
Alcott's body died while she was lecturing me about my manners. I
watched the field readings collapse in real time. Her consciousness
persisted in the resonance field for approximately forty minutes after
her body's death, and then it dissipated. She spent those forty minutes
expressing her displeasure."

"So she -- what? Died twice?"

"That is one way to put it. Her body died in the hospital. Her
consciousness persisted in my machine for forty minutes and then
ceased. Whether you call the second cessation a death depends on your
definition of death, which is -- well, that's why I called you, Dr.
Pryce. You're a philosopher. Define death for me."

Pryce was silent for a long time. "And the third?"

Maren's expression changed. The brisk, slightly manic energy that had
characterized her presentation drained away, replaced by something
quieter and more troubled.

"The third was different," she said.

                               * * *

The third time was May 15th, seven weeks ago. Maren had refined the
targeting mechanism, extending the effective range from approximately
ten miles to approximately fifty. She had also developed a method for
sustaining the resonance field for longer periods, theoretically
allowing a captured consciousness to persist indefinitely -- or at least
for as long as the vacuum tubes held out and the electric bill was
paid.

She had not intended to use the machine again. Dorothy Alcott's fury
had shaken her more than she cared to admit. There was something
deeply wrong about pulling people out of their deaths, and she had
begun to suspect that the wrongness was not merely ethical but
structural -- that the machine was doing something to the fabric of
time that she could not yet measure or understand.

But on the evening of May 15th, she had been monitoring the hospital
frequencies out of habit -- the way a retired sea captain might still
listen to the maritime band -- and she had heard a code that made her
blood freeze.

The code was for a child. A boy, eight years old, brought to New
Haven Hospital with severe head trauma after a fall from a tree. The
boy was dying. The surgeons were trying, but the damage was
catastrophic, and the radio traffic made it clear that the outcome was
not in doubt.

Maren had activated the machine before she was fully conscious of
making the decision.

The voice that came through the phonograph horn was small and
frightened.

"Hello? Where -- where am I? I was climbing the big tree. The oak on
Prospect Street. And I fell. I remember falling. And then -- Mommy?
Are you there? Mommy?"

Maren had gripped the edge of the table so hard her knuckles turned
white.

"My name is Dr. Osgood," she said, and her voice was steady because
she forced it to be steady. "You're safe. Can you tell me your name?"

"Tommy. Tommy Brewer. Where's my mom? I want my mom. Something's
wrong. I feel -- I feel funny. Like I'm not all the way here."

"Tommy, listen to me. You had a fall, and you're going to be
confused for a little while, but I need you to stay calm. Can you
do that for me?"

"I'm scared. I can't feel my legs. I can't feel anything. Where
am I?"

And then, before Maren could answer, the field readings spiked in
a way she had never seen before. The phonograph horn vibrated
violently. A second voice emerged, overlapping with Tommy's -- a
woman's voice, raw with grief and terror.

"Tommy! Oh God, Tommy, where are you? I can hear him -- I can hear
my son -- what have you done? What have you DONE?"

The mother. The machine had pulled the mother.

Not her consciousness -- she was still alive, presumably at the
hospital, presumably watching her son die. But something -- some
echo of her, some resonance between her grief and her son's
decoupling consciousness -- had been caught by the field and
amplified through the horn. Maren was hearing a living woman's anguish,
broadcast through a machine built to capture the dead.

The horn screamed for four minutes. Tommy's voice and his mother's
voice, tangled together, the boy calling for his mother and the mother
calling for her son, neither able to hear the other, both of them
speaking into a void that Maren had created.

When the field collapsed, Maren had shut down the machine, walked to
her bathroom, and been sick.

She had not turned the machine on again until Pryce arrived.

                               III.

"You have built," Pryce said, after a silence that lasted long enough
for the afternoon light to shift across the floorboards, "a machine
for making death worse."

Maren flinched. "That is not what I intended."

"What you intended is irrelevant. What you have done is extract
consciousness from the moment of death -- the one moment in a human
life that is, by definition, irreversible and inescapable -- and
placed it in a state of continued awareness without a body, without
sensation, without agency, and with full knowledge that it is dead.
You have created a conscious experience of death that persists beyond
death. You have, in the most literal sense imaginable, made a hell."

"That is an extreme characterization."

"Is it? Your Mrs. Alcott knew she was dead. She spent forty minutes
knowing she was dead. She spent forty minutes as a disembodied voice in
a stranger's living room, aware that her body was cooling on a hospital
bed and that nothing -- nothing at all -- could be done about it.
What would you call that experience, Dr. Osgood?"

Maren did not answer immediately. She went to the kitchen, made two
cups of tea with the deliberate precision of a woman who needed
something to do with her hands, and brought them back to the
laboratory. She handed one to Pryce and sat down on the stool beside
the machine.

"I would call it," she said, "a first draft."

Pryce looked at her sharply.

"The machine works, Dr. Pryce. It is crude, it is imprecise, and
its current implementation is -- I will grant you -- monstrous. But
the principle is sound. Consciousness can be extracted from the moment
of death and sustained in a resonance field. If the field can be
refined -- if a proper substrate can be provided, something more than
a phonograph horn and a glass cylinder -- then the extracted
consciousness could be given a new mode of existence. Not life as we
know it, but not the forty-minute purgatory that Mrs. Alcott endured.
Something. Some way of being."

"You're talking about immortality."

"I'm talking about continuation. There is a difference."

"The dead might disagree."

"The dead," Maren said, with a flash of the dark humor that her
friends knew well, "are not currently available for comment. That is
the entire problem I am trying to solve."

                               * * *

They agreed, after much argument, to conduct one more experiment.
Pryce's objections were numerous and well-articulated -- he was, after
all, a professional objector -- but they foundered on a single point
that Maren made with quiet force: the machine existed. It worked. It
was not going to un-exist. The question was not whether to use it but
how, and the only way to answer that question was to gather more data.

"Besides," she added, "I need a witness. Someone who can observe
and assess the experience from a philosophical perspective. Someone who
can talk to the -- to the subject -- and determine whether the
experience constitutes suffering."

"You need me to interview a dead person."

"I need you to interview a recently deceased consciousness that has
been temporally displaced into a resonance field. But yes, in layman's
terms, I need you to interview a dead person."

Pryce took off his glasses, polished them, put them back on, and said,
"I'm going to need more tea."

                               IV.

They waited until eleven o'clock that night. Maren monitored the
hospital frequencies while Pryce sat in the armchair, making notes
in a leather-bound journal and occasionally muttering to himself in
what Maren suspected was Greek.

At 11:14 PM, a code came through: elderly male, cardiac arrest, Yale-
New Haven Hospital, third floor. Maren activated the machine. The
vacuum tubes brightened. The copper coils hummed. The resonance field
expanded outward, invisible but measurable on her instruments, reaching
toward the hospital like a hand extended in the dark.

At 11:17 PM, the phonograph horn spoke.

"Well," said a voice -- dry, gravelly, distinctly amused. "This is
unexpected."

Maren checked her instruments. The field was stable. The consciousness
was anchored. She looked at Pryce and nodded.

Pryce leaned forward in his chair. "My name is Dr. Calvin Pryce. I'm
a philosopher at Yale University. Can you tell me your name?"

"Howard. Howard Pelletier. And you can save the delicate preamble,
Professor. I know what's happened. I'm dead."

Pryce glanced at Maren. She checked the hospital frequency: the code
had been called at 11:15. Howard Pelletier's body had died two minutes
before his voice emerged from the phonograph horn.

"How do you know?" Pryce asked.

"Because I remember dying. I was in my hospital bed. The nurse was
there -- nice girl, Puerto Rican, name of Marisol. The pain got very
bad and then it got very distant and then there was a feeling of --
hard to describe. Like being pulled through a keyhole. And now I'm
here, wherever here is, and I can hear you but I can't see a damn
thing, and I have no body, and the only explanation that makes any
sense is that I'm dead and this is what comes after."

"This is not what comes after," Maren said. "This is a machine. My
machine. It captured your consciousness at the moment of death and
pulled it forward in time --"

"Forward in time? How far forward?"

"Approximately two minutes."

"Two minutes." Howard Pelletier's voice carried a weight of
incredulity that was, under the circumstances, entirely reasonable.
"I have been dead for two minutes, and instead of whatever comes next
-- pearly gates, hellfire, oblivion, take your pick -- I'm in a
machine. In someone's living room. In 1955."

"Yes."

"Well. That's a hell of a thing."

                               * * *

Howard Pelletier, it turned out, was seventy-four years old, a retired
electrician from Hamden, a veteran of the First World War (he had lied
about his age and enlisted at sixteen), a widower, a grandfather of
seven, and a man who had spent the last three months dying of lung
cancer with what his doctors described as "remarkable equanimity" and
what Howard himself described as "not giving a damn."

"I had a good run," he told them. "Seventy-four years. Married the
best woman in Connecticut. Raised three kids who turned out decent.
Wired half the houses in New Haven. Never cheated a customer, never
hit a man who didn't swing first, and never missed a Sunday dinner
until the cancer got too bad. I made my peace. I was ready."

"And now?" Pryce asked, pen poised over his journal.

"And now I'm in a phonograph horn, and it's the damnedest thing, and
I'd like to know what you plan to do about it."

Pryce looked at Maren. "Dr. Osgood? What do we plan to do about it?"

Maren had been monitoring the field readings, which were holding steady
in a way that none of her previous experiments had achieved. Howard
Pelletier's consciousness was firmly anchored. He was not dissipating.
He was, by every metric she could measure, stable.

"I don't know," she said. It was the most honest thing she had said
all day.

"Well," Howard said, "while you're figuring it out, could someone
tell me the score of the Yankees game? I died before the ninth
inning."

                               V.

Over the next three days, Howard Pelletier became a resident of Maren
Osgood's living room.

This was not the plan. The plan -- insofar as Maren had possessed a
plan -- was to observe, document, and then allow the consciousness to
dissipate naturally when the resonance field decayed. But the field
did not decay. The modifications she had made to the sustaining
mechanism were more effective than she had anticipated, and Howard
showed no signs of fading.

Moreover, Howard did not want to fade.

"Let me get this straight," he said, on the second morning of his
post-mortem existence, while Maren ate toast and Pryce drank coffee
and both of them tried to pretend that having a conversation with a
dead man at breakfast was a normal activity. "You can turn this
machine off, and I'll -- what? Stop existing?"

"Your consciousness would dissipate. Yes."

"And if you leave it on?"

"You persist. Indefinitely, as far as I can determine."

"So my options are: continue to exist as a voice in a horn, or stop
existing entirely."

"That is a fair summary."

"Hell of a choice. But I'll take the horn. I've been dead before --
I mean, I flatlined on the table at a field hospital in France in
1918, and the medic brought me back. I did not care for the
experience. I'd rather be a voice in a box than nothing at all."

"You understand that this is not life," Pryce said. "You have no body.
No sensation. No ability to interact with the physical world beyond
speech."

"Professor, I spent the last three months of my life in a hospital
bed. Couldn't walk. Couldn't eat solid food. Could barely breathe.
The last thing I felt with my body was pain. If you're trying to make
me mourn the loss of physical sensation, you're talking to the wrong
customer."

                               * * *

The ethical implications were staggering. Pryce filled notebook after
notebook with them. If consciousness could be preserved after death,
who decided which deaths to intervene in? If a consciousness could be
sustained indefinitely in a resonance field, what were its rights?
Could a disembodied consciousness own property? Vote? Testify in court?
Was it a person? Was it a ghost? Was it something new, something for
which no legal or philosophical framework existed?

And beneath all of these questions was the one that Maren could not
stop asking herself, the one that woke her at three in the morning
and would not let her sleep:

Was it kind?

She had built a machine that reached into the moment of death and
pulled something out. She had meant it as a rescue. But Dorothy
Alcott had not wanted to be rescued. Tommy Brewer had not understood
what was happening to him. And Howard Pelletier, for all his cheerful
stoicism, was a disembodied voice in a phonograph horn, sustained by
vacuum tubes and copper wire, dependent on Maren Osgood's electric
bill for his continued existence.

Was that a rescue? Or was it something else -- something that wore
the shape of mercy but was, at its heart, a refusal to accept the
fundamental terms of human existence?

Maren did not know. She was a physicist. She was not equipped for
this question.

"That's why you need philosophers," Pryce told her, not unkindly.
"We're equipped for questions that don't have answers."

                               VI.

On the fourth day, the machine did something it had never done before.

Maren was in the kitchen, making coffee. Pryce was in the armchair,
reading. Howard was holding forth on the subject of proper wiring
technique in pre-war houses -- a topic on which his opinions were
strong and detailed -- when the phonograph horn emitted a sound that
was not a voice.

It was a frequency. A low, pulsing tone that made the fillings in
Maren's teeth ache and the coffee cups rattle on their hooks. The
resonance field readings on her instruments spiked wildly, exceeding
every parameter she had established. The vacuum tubes blazed with
a light that should not have been possible given their power rating.

And then there were other voices.

Not one. Not two. Dozens. Hundreds. A chorus of voices, overlapping
and interweaving, some speaking English and some speaking languages
Maren did not recognize, some whispering and some shouting and some
simply keening in wordless anguish or wonder.

Howard's voice cut through the cacophony: "Doc! Doc, something's
happening! I can -- I can see them! There are people here! I'm not
alone!"

Maren ran to the machine. The field readings were off every scale she
had. The resonance field was expanding -- not the controlled, targeted
expansion she had designed, but a wild, self-amplifying cascade that
was reaching further and further through time, pulling consciousness
after consciousness from the moment of death, an ever-widening net
cast across the temporal field.

"Turn it off!" Pryce shouted, on his feet now, the philosopher's
composure shattered. "Turn it off!"

Maren reached for the main power switch. Her hand closed around it.
She pulled.

Nothing happened. The machine continued to operate. The voices
continued to pour from the phonograph horn. The field continued to
expand.

"It's self-sustaining," she whispered. "The captured consciousnesses
are feeding the field. Each one adds energy. The field expands, catches
more, which adds more energy --"

"A chain reaction," Pryce said. "You've built a chain reaction."

"Oh God."

The voices grew louder. Maren could make out fragments now -- a woman
crying for her children, a man reciting a prayer in what sounded like
Aramaic, a child laughing, an old voice singing something that might
have been a hymn. The sound filled the living room, filled the house,
pressed against the walls like something trying to get out.

And then Howard's voice again, changed now, no longer the wry
electrician but something else, something that had seen what lay on
the other side of the resonance field:

"Doc. Listen to me. I can see them all. Every one of them. Everyone
who ever died. They're all here. They're all -- they're all stuck.
Stuck in the moment. The moment before the end. And they can feel it.
They can feel themselves dying, over and over, and they can't stop it,
and they can't finish it, and they're caught in the space between alive
and dead, and Doc --"

His voice broke.

"Doc, they're so tired. They've been dying for so long and they can't
stop."

                               * * *

Maren did the only thing she could think of. She picked up the machine,
cables and all, and carried it to the backyard. It was not a large
machine, but it was heavier than it looked, and the copper coils cut
into her hands as she stumbled through the kitchen door and down the
back steps.

The voices followed her. They poured from the phonograph horn like
smoke from a chimney, rising into the dark October night. The neighbors'
lights were coming on. A dog was barking somewhere. The stars were
very bright above New Haven and completely indifferent to what was
happening below them.

Pryce helped her set the machine on the grass. "What are you doing?"

"The resonance field is sustained by the captured consciousnesses. If
I can disrupt the field -- physically disrupt it -- the chain reaction
should stop. The consciousnesses will dissipate."

"All of them? Including Howard?"

Maren closed her eyes. "Including Howard."

From the phonograph horn, Howard's voice said, with perfect clarity:
"Do it, Doc. Let us go."

Maren opened her eyes. She went to the garden shed and came back
with a sledgehammer that she had last used to break up a concrete
walkway. She stood over the machine. The voices swirled around her,
thousands of them, millions perhaps, the accumulated dead of centuries
caught in a net she had woven from copper and glass and the terrible
arrogance of a woman who thought she could improve upon mortality.

"I'm sorry," she said. She was not sure who she was saying it to.
Everyone, perhaps.

She brought the sledgehammer down.

The glass cylinder shattered. The copper coils crumpled. The vacuum
tubes burst with small, sharp detonations like distant gunfire. The
resonance field collapsed with a sensation that Maren felt in her
bones -- a vast, silent exhalation, as if the air itself had been
holding its breath.

The voices stopped.

The night was quiet. A cricket chirped in the hedge. The neighbor's
dog stopped barking and, after a moment, began to whine softly instead.

Maren set the sledgehammer down on the grass. She looked at the
wreckage of her machine -- the shattered glass, the bent copper, the
broken tubes. Something was still glowing faintly in the ruins, a
pale luminescence that faded as she watched.

"Is it over?" Pryce asked.

"The field is gone. The consciousnesses have dissipated. They're --
whatever they are now. Whatever comes after after."

"And Howard?"

"Gone."

                               VII.

They sat on the back steps in silence for a long time. The night was
cool. Above them, the Milky Way stretched across the sky in its
ancient, untroubled arc.

"You'll rebuild it," Pryce said. It was not a question.

"No," Maren said, and she was surprised to find that she meant it.
"I'll publish the theory. The resonance field equations, the temporal
coupling mechanics, the whole framework. I'll make it available. But
I won't build another machine."

"Someone else will."

"Yes. Someone else will. And they'll make the same mistakes I made,
or different ones, or possibly better ones. But it won't be me. I've
done enough."

"Why?"

Maren thought about it. She thought about Istvan Molnar, confused
and frightened in a stranger's living room. She thought about Dorothy
Alcott, furious at the indignity of being rescued from a death she
had earned. She thought about Tommy Brewer, calling for his mother.
She thought about Howard Pelletier, who had chosen existence over
oblivion and then, in the end, had chosen oblivion over an eternity
of listening to the dead scream.

"Because the dead don't want to be saved," she said. "They want to
be finished. And the living don't want to save the dead -- not really.
They want to save themselves from the fact that death exists. And no
machine can do that. Not mine, not anyone's."

Pryce nodded slowly. He closed his journal and slipped it into his
coat pocket.

"For what it's worth," he said, "I think Dorothy Alcott would approve
of that conclusion."

"Dorothy Alcott would tell me it was about time I came to my senses."

"Probably."

They sat a while longer. A church bell struck midnight somewhere in
the distance -- an old bell, with a tone that carried farther than
it should have in the still night air.

"The Yankees won, by the way," Pryce said quietly. "Seven to three."

Maren smiled. It was the saddest smile Calvin Pryce had ever seen.

"He would have liked that," she said.

The cricket chirped. The stars turned. Somewhere, in the ruins of
the machine, the last faint trace of luminescence flickered and
went out, and the dark reclaimed its own.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         THE MASKED BALL

                        by Oscar Lennox

================================================================================

                               I.

In a world only slightly to the left of our own, the dead walk.

This is not metaphor, though the living often wish it were. It is
not religion, though the churches have had to revise their doctrines
considerably. It is a simple fact of biology -- or perhaps of physics,
or perhaps of something that predates both and for which no discipline
has yet found the proper terminology. In this world, death is not an
ending but a transition: the body fails, the breath ceases, the heart
stops its ancient labor, and then, after a period of stillness that
lasts between nine minutes and nine hours (the variance has never been
explained), the dead person opens their eyes and sits up.

They are changed, of course. The dead do not eat, do not sleep, do
not generate body heat. Their skin takes on a grayish pallor that
no cosmetic can fully conceal, and their eyes develop a faint
luminescence that is most visible in dim light. They do not age
further -- a man who dies at thirty remains thirty, a woman who dies
at ninety remains ninety, for as long as the Second Duration (as
the post-mortem period is formally known) persists. And the Second
Duration does persist: decades, centuries, possibly forever. No one
has yet observed a terminal point.

They retain their memories, their personalities, their intelligence.
They can speak, think, argue, love, hate, create, and destroy. What
they cannot do is touch the living without causing pain -- a searing
cold that burns like the opposite of fire and leaves no mark but
lingers for days. This is the Chill, and it is the primary barrier
between the two states of being.

In all other respects, the dead are simply -- there. They live (if
that is the right word, and the lexicographers have been arguing about
it since the phenomenon was first documented in 1793) alongside the
living, in the same cities, the same houses, sometimes the same
families. A widow might share her home with her dead husband for
decades. A child might grow up in the company of grandparents who
died before she was born. The population of the world is larger than
it would be in a world where death was final -- substantially larger,
though the census figures are disputed, since the dead have resisted
being counted with a stubbornness that the Bureau of Statistics finds
extremely vexing.

The relationship between the living and the dead is, as one might
imagine, complex.

                               * * *

Professor Elliot Cross, who held the Whitfield Chair of Comparative
Thanatology at Harvard University, was acutely aware of this
complexity. It was, in fact, his professional specialty. He had spent
twenty-three years studying the social, psychological, and
philosophical dimensions of the relationship between the living and
the dead, and he had published four books on the subject, each one
more cautious in its conclusions than the last. His first book, written
at thirty with the confidence of youth, had been titled "The Bridge
Between: Toward a Unified Theory of Living and Dead." His most recent,
written at fifty-three with the humility of experience, was titled
"Some Preliminary Notes Toward a Possible Framework for Beginning to
Understand Certain Aspects of the Question."

He was, in short, a man who had learned that the more you studied
death, the less you knew about it.

On the evening of October 31st, 1955 -- All Hallows' Eve -- Cross
stood before the mirror in his bedroom in the house on Brattle Street,
Cambridge, and adjusted his costume.

The costume was elaborate. It had to be. On All Hallows' Eve, the
rules changed.

For three hundred and sixty-four days of the year, the living and the
dead occupied a shared world in which everyone knew who was who. The
Chill made physical contact unambiguous -- you touched a dead person
and you knew. The pallor was visible in daylight. The luminescent
eyes were unmistakable in the dark. There was no confusion, and
therefore no pretense.

But on All Hallows' Eve, pretense was the point.

The tradition had arisen spontaneously in the early 1800s, shortly
after the first generation of documented dead had settled into their
Second Duration and the novelty had worn off enough for social rituals
to develop. On this one night, the living disguised themselves as
the dead -- applying gray makeup, wearing contact lenses that mimicked
the luminescent glow, lowering their body temperature with ice baths
and cooling garments -- and the dead disguised themselves as the
living, using cosmetics and heating pads and colored contacts to
simulate the appearance of vitality.

On this one night, at balls and gatherings across the world, no one
could tell who was who.

The purpose of the tradition was debated. Some anthropologists argued
that it was a safety valve, a ritualized release of the tension that
inevitably accumulated between two populations sharing a world. Some
psychologists suggested it was therapeutic, allowing the living to
rehearse their eventual death and the dead to mourn their lost
vitality. Some historians simply pointed out that human beings had
always loved costume parties, and death was merely the most dramatic
costume available.

Cross, who had written extensively on the subject, believed all of
these explanations and none of them. The Masked Ball was, in his
professional opinion, one of those human phenomena that exceeded every
theory brought to bear upon it.

He was attending tonight not in his professional capacity but in his
personal one, and this distinction mattered, because the personal was
where the trouble lay.

                               II.

The ball was held, as it was every year, in the great hall of Memorial
Hall -- a Gothic cathedral of a building on the edge of Harvard Yard
that had been designed to honor the dead of the Civil War and had,
in the century since, accumulated a population of dead that the
original architects could scarcely have imagined. The building was
never entirely empty. Dead alumni wandered its corridors at all hours,
attending lectures they had missed in life or simply sitting in Sanders
Theatre, listening to the silence.

Tonight, the great hall was transformed. Candles burned in iron
sconces along the walls, casting a flickering light that made it
impossible to tell the difference between genuine pallor and
theatrical makeup. A string quartet played in the gallery above --
two living musicians and two dead ones, indistinguishable in their
evening dress. The air smelled of autumn: fallen leaves, wood smoke,
and something fainter beneath it, something that might have been the
scent of cold stone or old earth or the particular mineral quality
that the dead carried with them, a smell that was not decay but
something adjacent to it, something that reminded the living of
cellars and churches and the deep interior of caves.

Cross descended the main staircase and entered the crowd. He was
dressed as a dead man: gray makeup on his face and hands, luminescent
contact lenses that gave his brown eyes an eerie, blue-green glow,
a cooling vest beneath his tuxedo that lowered his skin temperature
to the ambient chill of the recently deceased. He had done this
before, many times. He knew how to move like the dead -- the slightly
too-precise movements, the economy of gesture, the way they held
their heads at angles that the living found subtly wrong, as if the
dead were always listening to something the living could not hear.

He also knew how to look for the dead who were disguised as the living.
Their makeup was good -- it was always good, they had centuries of
practice -- but there were tells. The dead did not blink often enough.
Their breathing, when they bothered with it (many did, out of habit
or courtesy), was too regular, too mechanical, like a clock ticking
rather than a lung working. And their eyes, behind the colored
contacts, sometimes caught the light at angles that revealed the
luminescence beneath, the way a cat's eyes catch light in the dark.

Cross circulated through the crowd, accepting a glass of champagne
from a waiter who was either living or dead and whose professional
neutrality made it impossible to determine which. The champagne was
real. The dead could drink, though they derived no nourishment from
it and reported that the experience was "like the memory of a taste"
-- present but attenuated, a echo of the original sensation.

He spoke with colleagues, with students, with strangers whose vital
status he could not determine and did not attempt to. This was the
etiquette of the Masked Ball: you did not ask. You did not pry. You
accepted the ambiguity and you danced with it, literally and
figuratively, for one night.

He was on his second glass of champagne when he saw her.

                               * * *

She was standing near the north wall, beneath a portrait of some
forgotten benefactor, holding a glass of white wine and watching the
dancers with an expression of amused detachment. She wore a gown of
dark green silk and no visible costume -- no gray makeup, no luminescent
contacts, no cooling garments. She appeared to be a living woman who
had come to the ball without bothering to disguise herself, which was
either a deliberate provocation or a statement of such supreme
confidence that it looped back around to being a provocation anyway.

She was beautiful, but that was not what stopped Cross in his tracks.
What stopped him was that he recognized her.

Her name was Vivian Ashford, and she had died three years ago.

He knew this because he had attended her funeral. He had stood in Mount
Auburn Cemetery on a gray November afternoon and watched her coffin
lowered into the ground, and he had delivered one of the eulogies,
because Vivian Ashford had been his colleague, his collaborator, and --
for one brief, luminous, complicated year before her death -- something
more.

She had died of an aneurysm, sudden and catastrophic, at her desk in
Emerson Hall on a Tuesday afternoon. She had been forty-six years old.
She had been in the middle of a sentence -- a letter to the editor of
the Journal of Thanatological Studies, disputing a claim about the
emotional capacity of the dead -- and the sentence remained forever
unfinished, the pen trailing off the page in a line that Cross had
kept, pressed between the pages of his copy of her last book.

She had not risen. This was the fact that had haunted Cross for three
years, the fact that made her death anomalous and terrible in a way
that other deaths in this world were not. In a world where the dead
walked, Vivian Ashford had died and stayed dead. Her body had remained
still on the office floor. The nine-minute minimum had passed, then
nine hours, then nine days, and she had not opened her eyes.

It happened, rarely. Perhaps one death in ten thousand was a True
Death -- a death from which there was no Second Duration, no return,
no continuation. The mechanism was not understood. Some researchers
attributed it to the nature of the brain injury; others to a failure
in whatever process initiated the Second Duration; others to something
more metaphysical, a reluctance of the consciousness to persist, a
choice made at a level below awareness. Cross had published a paper
on the phenomenon, cautiously arguing that True Death might represent
a form of consent -- that some people, for reasons that could not be
articulated, simply chose not to come back.

He had written that paper before Vivian died. After her death, he had
been unable to read it.

And now she was standing ten feet away from him, wearing a green silk
dress and holding a glass of white wine, and she was looking directly
at him.

"Hello, Elliot," she said.

                               III.

"That's impossible," Cross said, which was not the most articulate
response to seeing a dead woman at a party, but was at least honest.

"Many things are impossible," Vivian said. "Yet here we are. Do you
like the dress? I had the most terrible time finding something
appropriate. Fashion moves so quickly when you're not paying attention."

Her voice was exactly as he remembered it: warm, precise, faintly
sardonic, with the trace of a British accent that she had acquired
during a year at Oxford and never entirely shed. Her face was exactly
as he remembered it: the high cheekbones, the dark eyes, the slight
asymmetry of her smile that made her look as if she were always on
the verge of a joke she had decided not to tell.

She did not look dead. She did not have the pallor, the luminescence,
the subtle wrongness of posture that characterized the dead. She
looked alive. She looked, in fact, more vividly alive than most of
the living people in the room, as if whatever force animated her was
burning at a higher wattage than the standard human allotment.

Cross's training asserted itself. He looked for the tells. He looked
for the too-regular breathing, the infrequent blink, the mechanical
quality of movement.

He found none of them. She breathed naturally. She blinked at normal
intervals. She moved with the fluid, unselfconscious grace that the
dead could imitate but never quite replicate, because the dead were
always, on some level, performing the act of being alive, and
performance always carried a trace of deliberation.

"You're alive," he said.

"Am I? How can you tell? This is the Masked Ball, Elliot. No one can
tell."

"I've spent twenty-three years studying the difference between the
living and the dead. I can tell."

"And yet you're wrong remarkably often, aren't you? Your own research
shows that trained observers misidentify vital status approximately
eighteen percent of the time during Masked Ball conditions. Eighteen
percent, Elliot. Nearly one in five."

This was true. It was from his own paper, published in 1951, and it
was one of the findings that had most disturbed him. If a trained
thanatologist could be wrong one time in five, what hope did the
average person have?

"You died," he said. "I was at your funeral. I delivered a eulogy."

"Was it good?"

"It was -- Vivian, this is not a conversation about eulogies."

"Everything is a conversation about eulogies, eventually. But I take
your point. You want to know how I can be here."

"I want to know what you are."

The faint asymmetric smile appeared. "Now that is the right question.
Shall we dance?"

                               * * *

They danced. The string quartet was playing a waltz -- something by
Strauss, elegant and melancholy in the way that waltzes always are,
the three-quarter time carrying an inherent suggestion of something
incomplete, something that keeps reaching for a beat that isn't there.

Cross held his hand out in the formal position. If she was dead -- if
she was in her Second Duration, three years delayed -- then the
contact of his hand against hers would produce the Chill, that searing
cold that was the unmistakable signature of the dead.

Vivian placed her hand in his.

Her hand was warm. Not the artificial warmth of a heating pad or a
chemical handwarmer, but the living warmth of circulating blood and
active metabolism. He could feel her pulse in her wrist -- or he
thought he could. The music was loud and his own pulse was racing and
the room was full of bodies both living and dead, and in the
candlelight, with the scent of autumn and old stone in the air, the
senses became unreliable.

"No Chill," he said.

"No Chill," she agreed.

"So you're alive."

"That's one explanation."

"What's another?"

"That I'm dead and the Chill doesn't apply to me. That I'm something
else entirely. That you're imagining this. That you drank too much
champagne. That the Masked Ball creates conditions in which the
boundary between living and dead becomes, for one night, genuinely
permeable, and things are possible that are not possible on any other
night of the year."

They turned. The other couples on the dance floor moved around them
in slow, candlelit orbits -- some living, some dead, all disguised,
all performing the ancient human ritual of pretending to be something
they were not.

"You published a paper," Vivian said, "arguing that True Death might
represent a form of consent. That some people choose not to come back."

"You read it?"

"I read everything you write. I always have. Even after."

"After you died."

"After I died. Yes."

"How? You were -- you didn't rise. There was no Second Duration. You
were buried."

"And yet I read your papers. Consider what that implies."

Cross considered it. The implications branched outward in every
direction, each branch splitting into further branches, a tree of
possibility that grew toward a sky he could not see.

"It implies," he said slowly, "that True Death is not what we think
it is. That it's not an absence but a -- a different kind of presence.
One that doesn't manifest physically. One that doesn't produce a
Second Duration with a visible body but that persists in some other
form."

"Go on."

"It implies that you've been here. For three years. Present but not
manifest. Aware but not visible. That you chose not to come back in
the usual way, but you didn't choose to leave entirely."

"And tonight?"

"And tonight -- the Masked Ball. The one night when the boundary is
permeable. The one night when the disguises are so thorough that
even the fundamental distinction between living and dead becomes
uncertain. On this night, your presence can -- what? Manifest?
Solidify? Become visible because the rules are suspended and there
is, for one night, no category that excludes you?"

Vivian smiled. It was the full smile this time, not the asymmetric
half-smile but the real one, the one that Cross remembered from the
year they had spent together, the smile that meant he had said
something that pleased her and that she was deciding how much of her
pleasure to reveal.

"You always were the sharpest mind in the department," she said.

"You were sharper."

"Yes. But I had the advantage of being dead, which gives one a certain
perspective."

                               IV.

They left the dance floor and found a quiet alcove off the main hall,
a small stone chamber with a window that looked out onto the cemetery.
Mount Auburn Cemetery was visible in the distance, its paths lit by
the paper lanterns that the dead placed on their graves each All
Hallows' Eve -- a tradition that was either a celebration or a
memorial, depending on whom you asked.

"Tell me what it's like," Cross said. He was sitting on a stone bench.
Vivian stood by the window, looking out at the lanterns. The
candlelight from the hall reached only partway into the alcove, and
her face was half-illuminated, half in shadow. "Being what you are.
Neither risen nor gone. Present but not manifest."

"It's like standing in a room full of people who can't see you," she
said. "You can hear everything. You can see everything. You can stand
next to someone you love and watch them grieve for you and you cannot
reach them. You cannot touch them. You cannot say, 'I'm here. I
didn't leave. I chose to stay.'"

"Why didn't you rise? In the usual way?"

Vivian was quiet for a moment. Outside, a group of costumed figures
crossed the darkened lawn -- living or dead, it was impossible to
tell.

"Because rising is a compromise," she said. "You come back, but you
come back diminished. The Chill. The pallor. The attenuation of
sensation. The dead who rise are present, but they are present at a
distance -- always separated from the living by that boundary of
cold, always visible but never quite touchable. I didn't want that.
I wanted to be fully present or fully gone, and when the moment came,
when the choice presented itself in that space between the last
heartbeat and whatever comes after -- I chose neither."

"You chose to stay without being seen."

"I chose to stay without being limited. The Second Duration is a
cage, Elliot. A comfortable cage, with the appearance of freedom,
but a cage nonetheless. The dead walk, but they walk in a world
that is always, subtly, telling them that they don't belong. The
Chill. The pallor. The way the living flinch. I didn't want to
spend eternity being flinched at."

"So you stayed as -- what? A ghost? A presence?"

"A possibility. I stayed as a possibility. And on this one night,
the night when possibilities are honored, I can be here."

"With me."

"With you."

The string quartet had shifted to something slower -- a nocturne,
perhaps, or a lullaby, the melody drifting through the stone corridors
of the building like smoke through a cathedral.

"I have a question," Cross said. "A professional question."

"Ask it."

"If True Death is not an ending but a choice -- a choice to persist
in a different way -- then every True Death we've documented, every
case we've classified as permanent, might be wrong. Every person we've
mourned as truly gone might be standing right beside us, invisible,
present, aware. Every funeral might be attended by the person being
buried."

"Yes."

"That changes everything."

"It changes nothing. It changes the theory. It doesn't change the
experience. The living still grieve. The invisible dead still cannot
be reached. Understanding the mechanism doesn't eliminate the
separation. It just makes the separation more poignant."

"That is a bleak conclusion."

"I'm dead, Elliot. We tend toward bleakness."

He laughed, and the sound surprised him -- a genuine laugh, the first
one he had produced in longer than he cared to calculate. Vivian
smiled, and for a moment they were not a living man and a dead woman
in a stone alcove on All Hallows' Eve. They were two people who
had once been in love, and the distance between them was not the
distance between life and death but the ordinary distance between
two hearts that had failed to find the right timing.

                               V.

At midnight, the bells of Memorial Hall began to toll, and the
tradition demanded its culmination.

At midnight, the masks came off.

Across the great hall, the living and the dead revealed themselves.
Living men and women wiped away their gray makeup, removed their
luminescent contacts, shed their cooling garments. Dead men and women
did the same in reverse, allowing the pallor to show, the
luminescence to emerge, the Chill to reassert itself as the barriers
between the two states were restored.

It was always a moment of strange, communal vulnerability. For one
night, the boundary had been erased, and restoring it required an
act of courage -- the courage to be, once again, unambiguously what
you were. The living stood revealed in their fragile, temporary
vitality. The dead stood revealed in their permanent, diminished
persistence. And for a moment, as the masks came off and the truth
was laid bare, every person in the room -- living and dead alike --
felt the weight of what they were and what they were not.

Cross watched from the alcove as the unmasking rippled through the
crowd. He saw friends reveal themselves, colleagues, strangers. He
saw a living woman embrace a dead man -- her husband, perhaps, or
her father -- and flinch at the Chill but hold on anyway, the pain
a price worth paying for the contact.

He turned to Vivian. "What happens to you? When the masks come off?"

"I go back. To the space between. To the invisible persistence. To
the possibility without manifestation."

"Until next year?"

"Until next year. Or until someone finds a way to make the boundary
permanently permeable. Or until I decide that I've stayed long enough
and choose to move on to whatever comes after the after."

"Is there something after the after?"

"I don't know. The dead who rise don't know either. Nobody knows.
It's the one question that death doesn't answer."

The bells continued to toll. Eleven strokes. The twelfth was coming.
At the twelfth stroke, All Hallows' Eve would be over, and the rules
would reassert themselves, and Vivian Ashford would vanish from his
sight for another year.

"Come back," Cross said. "Next year. Please."

Vivian stepped toward him. In the candlelight, she was luminous --
not with the cold luminescence of the dead, but with something warmer,
something that existed outside the established categories, something
that his twenty-three years of professional study had not equipped
him to classify.

She placed her hand on his cheek. Her touch was warm. It carried no
Chill, no pain, no cold. It was simply a hand on a face, the most
ancient gesture of tenderness, and Cross closed his eyes and leaned
into it and felt, for the first time in three years, that the space
she had occupied in his life was not empty.

"I never left," she said. "That's the part you need to understand,
Elliot. I never left. I was always here. Every lecture you gave, every
paper you wrote, every night you sat in your study and looked at the
empty chair across from your desk. I was there. I've always been
there."

"I can't see you."

"You can't see radio waves either, but you don't doubt they exist."

"That's not the same thing."

"It's exactly the same thing. It's exactly the same thing, and the
fact that you can't see it is the tragedy of being alive. The living
are blind, Elliot. You're surrounded by presences you cannot perceive,
separated from the people you love by nothing more than the limitations
of your own senses. And you call that separation death, and you mourn
it, and you write papers about it, when the truth is that no one has
ever been separated from anyone. The distance is an illusion. The only
real distance is the one you create by believing it exists."

The twelfth bell struck.

The sound hung in the air for a long time, a single resonant tone
that seemed to pass through the stone walls and the glass windows and
the bodies of the living and the dead alike, touching everything,
changing nothing.

When the sound faded, Cross opened his eyes.

The alcove was empty. Vivian was gone. The candle in the iron sconce
on the wall had burned down to a stub, its flame guttering in a
draft that came from nowhere.

He sat on the stone bench for a long time. The sounds of the
unmasking -- laughter, exclamations, the rustling of costumes being
shed -- drifted in from the great hall. The string quartet had stopped
playing. Somewhere, a woman was singing, softly, in a voice that might
have been living or dead.

Cross looked down at his hand. On his palm, where Vivian's hand had
rested, there was a faint mark -- not a burn, not a frostbite scar,
but something else, something that looked like a fingerprint made of
light, glowing faintly in the dark.

He watched it fade. It took a long time -- longer than he expected,
longer than any afterimage should persist. And as it faded, he felt
something inside him shift, not dramatically, not with the violence
of revelation, but gently, the way a compass needle turns when the
magnetic field changes: a quiet reorientation toward a truth he had
been circling for twenty-three years without ever quite arriving at.

The dead were not gone. The True Dead were not truly dead. The
boundary between states was not a wall but a membrane, and on one
night a year, the membrane became thin enough for the light to come
through.

This was not a finding he could publish. It was not a conclusion
he could support with data. It was a thing he knew the way you know
your own name: not because someone proved it to you, but because it
was yours, and it had always been yours, and the only surprise was
that it had taken so long to recognize it.

                               * * *

He left the ball at one in the morning, stepping out into the
November cold. The paper lanterns in the cemetery were still burning,
small points of amber light among the gravestones and the trees. The
sky was clear. The stars were very bright.

Cross walked home through the empty streets of Cambridge, his
costume half-removed, the gray makeup still on his face, the
luminescent contacts in his breast pocket. He looked like a man
caught between states, which was, he supposed, exactly what he was.

When he reached his house on Brattle Street, he went to his study.
He sat at his desk. He looked at the empty chair across from him --
the chair where Vivian had sat during the year they had worked
together, arguing about the nature of consciousness and the
persistence of self and whether the dead were truly present or merely
the memory of presence wearing a familiar shape.

"Good night, Vivian," he said to the empty chair.

The chair did not respond. It did not move. It did not glow. It
remained exactly what it appeared to be: an empty chair in a quiet
room in a house on Brattle Street, in a world where the dead walked
and the truly dead were still, and the distance between the two was
either infinite or nothing at all.

But Cross, sitting in his study at one-thirty in the morning on the
first day of November, with the last traces of gray makeup on his
face and the memory of warm fingers on his cheek, found that he did
not believe in the chair's emptiness.

He never would again.

                               VI.

In the morning, Cross went to his office at Harvard. He opened his
notebook and began to write. Not a paper -- not yet. Not a theory.
Just notes. Fragments. The beginning of a new framework, one that
would take years to develop and might never be complete.

He wrote:

     The Masked Ball reveals what the rest of the year conceals:
     that the boundary between living and dead is not a fixed
     property of the universe but a social construction, maintained
     by mutual agreement and reinforced by sensory limitation. When
     the agreement is suspended and the limitations are deliberately
     confused, the boundary becomes permeable. This permeability
     suggests that the boundary is not fundamental.

     If the boundary is not fundamental, then "living" and "dead"
     are not ontological categories but perceptual ones. The dead
     do not exist in a different state; they exist in the same state,
     perceived differently.

     Corollary: True Death may not be a failure of the Second
     Duration but a refusal of the perceptual framework entirely.
     The True Dead are not gone. They have simply declined to be
     perceived on the available terms.

     Question: Is it possible to change the terms?

He paused. He looked at the empty chair. He looked at the faint mark
on his palm, which had not fully faded. It was barely visible now, a
trace of luminescence that might have been a trick of the morning light
or might have been something else.

He wrote one more line:

     I believe it is.

Then he closed the notebook, put on his coat, and went out into the
November morning. The streets of Cambridge were filled with the living
and the dead, going about their business in the gray autumn light,
distinguishable from each other by the usual signs -- the pallor, the
luminescence, the careful distance maintained against the Chill.

But Cross, walking among them, found himself looking at the spaces
between them -- the gaps, the absences, the places where someone might
be standing, invisible and warm and patient, waiting for the one night
a year when the masks came off and the boundary thinned and the light
came through.

There were more of them than anyone suspected.

He was certain of it.

The morning was cold, and the sky was gray, and the dead walked
openly in the streets, and somewhere in the spaces between what
could be seen and what could not, Vivian Ashford was watching.

He could not prove it. He could not measure it. He could not
publish it.

But he knew.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

HARRISON BLACKWOOD lives in Brattleboro, Vermont, in the farmhouse
where he was born, and writes in a study that looks out over the Green
Mountains. His stories have appeared in these pages since issue #4 and
in Weird Tales, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and Other
Worlds. He describes his fiction as "an attempt to convey the sensation
of standing at the edge of a cliff that has no bottom." "The Thing in
the Walls of the World" is his most ambitious story to date, and we
suspect it will trouble your sleep. He would consider that a
compliment.

LUCIAN MARSH claims to reside in Arkham, Massachusetts, though his
mail is delivered to a cottage in Gloucester. A former orderly at a
Providence psychiatric hospital and a student of the intersection
between psychology and the uncanny, his stories have appeared in Tales
from the Future and Beyond, Weird Tales, and several publications whose
names he declines to share. He has published one collection, The
Lighthouse and Other Darknesses (Arkham House, 1954). "The
Preservation Society" is his eighth story for this magazine and
his darkest -- which, given the competition, is saying something.
He communicates exclusively by letter and has asked us to inform
readers that he does not attend conventions, does not accept speaking
engagements, and would prefer not to be sought out in person.

THEODORE CAIN needs no introduction to regular readers of this
magazine, having appeared in nearly every issue since the first. A
former autoworker and technical writer from Dearborn, Michigan, he
is the most prolific contributor in our history and one of the most
versatile. His thirty-one stories for this magazine span every sub-
genre from hard SF to horror, and "The Jack-o'-Lantern Nebula" finds
him in fine Halloween form, delivering a deep-space ghost story with
his characteristic efficiency and craft. He writes every evening
from eight to midnight and delivers his manuscripts on time, which
his editor considers a form of heroism.

AGNES WHITFIELD farms wheat outside Salina, Kansas, and writes at her
kitchen table between chores. Her stories have appeared in Tales from
the Future and Beyond, Galaxy, and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science
Fiction, and she has been quietly producing some of the finest post-
apocalyptic fiction in the genre since her debut in issue #13. "The
Inheritance of Teeth" marks a departure for her -- a horror story set
not after catastrophe but during a very personal one -- and it is among
the most unsettling stories we have published in three years. She would
like readers to know that the farmhouse in the story is fictional and
that her own farmhouse is "perfectly normal, thank you."

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY has been writing professional fiction since 1939
and has published in more magazines than he can conveniently list. A
South Side Chicago native and veteran of the pulp trenches, he brings
the storyteller's ancient virtues -- pace, suspense, and a voice you'd
follow anywhere -- to everything he writes. "Nightwatch" is his
twentieth story for this magazine and one of his most unsettling, a
slow-burning tale of a space station where the crew count keeps
changing. He lives in Rogers Park, Chicago, with his wife Carol,
an indeterminate number of cats, and a lifetime supply of Lucky
Strikes.

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW is a former philosophy student, a self-taught
physicist, and the finest time-travel writer currently working in
the field. Her stories have appeared in these pages since issue #9,
and each one is a precisely engineered mechanism that appears to be
a narrative but is, on closer inspection, a paradox in disguise.
"The Seance Machine" is her entry in our Halloween tradition, a story
about a woman who builds a device for contacting the dead and
discovers that the dead have opinions about being contacted. It is
by turns funny, chilling, and profoundly sad, which is to say it is
a Phyllis Crenshaw story. She lives in Philadelphia with her husband
David, two children, and a blackboard covered in temporal equations
that she assures us are "purely theoretical."

OSCAR LENNOX is a historian, a philosopher of possibility, and the
author of some of the most intellectually ambitious fiction this
magazine has published. A professor of history at Boston University,
he has written for Tales from the Future and Beyond since issue #8,
specializing in alternate histories and parallel world stories that
are distinguished by their erudition and their emotional depth. "The
Masked Ball" is his contribution to our October issue, a story set in
a world where the dead walk among the living and All Hallows' Eve is
the one night when no one can tell who is who. It is a ghost story,
a love story, and a philosophical meditation, and we think it is one
of the finest things he has written. He lives in Brookline,
Massachusetts, with his wife Patricia and an apartment full of maps.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading the July issue and I must write to you
immediately about Harrison Blackwood's "Echo Garden." I have read
every story this magazine has published since the first issue and I
can say without hesitation that this is the most deeply unsettling
piece of fiction I have encountered in any magazine, in any genre. The
passage where the astronomer realizes that the signal he has been
studying is not coming from the nebula but from the space between the
nebula's arms -- the void itself -- gave me a feeling of vertigo so
acute that I had to set the magazine down and go outside. In daylight.
Mr. Blackwood understands something about the cosmos that most of us
would prefer not to know, and he has the terrible gift of making us
know it anyway. More, please. Even if it costs me sleep.

                              -- Gerald Whitmore
                                 Amherst, Massachusetts

Dear Sterling,

Koslov's "Bohr Maneuver" in the July issue is one of his finest.
The orbital mechanics during the slingshot sequence are, so far as I
can determine, flawless -- and I checked them twice, with slide rule
in hand. I particularly admired the restraint of the ending: Koslov
trusts his readers to understand the implications of the final
trajectory calculation without spelling them out. That said, I believe
there is a minor error in the hydrogen fuel mass calculation on what
would be page 47 of the published text. The figure given is 1,840 kg,
but given the stated delta-v requirements and the specific impulse of
the engine described, the correct figure should be approximately
2,115 kg. I realize this is a quibble, but Dr. Koslov has set a
standard of precision that invites quibbling. I offer this correction
with the utmost respect.

                              -- Dr. Nathan Colquitt

[Dr. Colquitt is correct, and Dr. Koslov has asked us to print his
"profound mortification and sincere thanks." The error has been noted
for any future reprints. -- Ed.]

Dear Max,

Three cheers for Bob Finley's "Midnight Shift" in the July number!
Finally, a story in your magazine that a working man can read on
his lunch break without needing a Ph.D. to understand it. Finley
writes the way stories ought to be written: fast, clear, and with
a punch at the end that makes you want to read it again. The scene
in the engine room where Braddock has to choose between sealing the
hatch and saving Kowalski is the most exciting thing I've read all
year. More Finley! Less of the professors!

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am writing to express my appreciation for Theodore Cain's "Man's
Best Friend, Mark VII" in your July issue. As a veterinarian, I was
initially skeptical of a story about a robotic dog, but Mr. Cain has
achieved something remarkable: he has written a story about the bond
between a human and a machine that is as emotionally affecting as any
story about a real animal I have ever read. The final scene, where
Mark VII performs his last programmed behavior -- bringing the
newspaper to the door of a house whose owner has been dead for six
months -- brought me to tears. I am not ashamed to admit this. If a
machine can be written with such compassion, perhaps there is hope
for the rest of us.

                              -- Dr. Helen Macready, D.V.M.
                                 Ithaca, New York

Dear Sir,

Colonel Stanton's "Turncoat" is the most honest piece of military
fiction I have read since leaving the service. The scene in the brig,
where Captain Halloran explains why he defected -- not for ideology,
not for money, but because he could no longer reconcile his orders
with his conscience -- is as fine a piece of writing about the moral
weight of command as anything in the literature. I served twelve years
in the Navy and I have known men like Halloran. Colonel Stanton has

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

LONG TOMORROW by Leigh Brackett
(Doubleday, 1955, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mrs. Brackett, better known for her planetary romances and her
screenwriting (she co-authored "The Big Sleep" for Howard Hawks), has
produced a novel of startling power and maturity. Set in a post-nuclear
America where technology has been outlawed by constitutional amendment
and the population has retreated to small agrarian communities, "The
Long Tomorrow" follows two boys -- Len and Cousin Esau -- as they
pursue rumors of a hidden city where the old knowledge is preserved.
It is a coming-of-age story, an adventure story, and a profoundly
thoughtful meditation on the relationship between knowledge and fear.
Brackett writes with a clean, muscular prose that serves the story's
emotional needs without calling attention to itself, and her depiction
of a society that has chosen ignorance over risk is uncomfortably
relevant. Essential reading. Highest recommendation.

THE CHRYSALIDS by John Wyndham
(Michael Joseph, 1955, 12s 6d; U.S. edition forthcoming)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Wyndham's latest novel, set in a post-catastrophe Labrador where
genetic purity is enforced with religious fervor, is a quiet
masterpiece of social science fiction. Young David Strorm grows up in
a community that destroys any plant, animal, or human that deviates
from the "true image" -- and discovers that he and several other
children are themselves deviants, possessing the ability to communicate
telepathically. The novel is a devastating critique of fundamentalism,
conformity, and the fear of difference, rendered in Wyndham's
characteristically lucid and deceptively simple prose. British readers
have had the advantage of us here -- the novel has been available since
spring -- but American readers will soon have their chance. Do not
miss it.

TUNNEL IN THE SKY by Robert A. Heinlein
(Scribner's, 1955, $2.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Heinlein's latest juvenile -- though, as always with Heinlein, the
word "juvenile" is misleading, since his young adult novels contain
more genuine thought about human nature than most adult fiction -- drops
a class of students on an alien planet for a survival exam and then
strands them there when the return gate malfunctions. What follows is
a compressed Lord of the Flies in reverse: instead of descending into
savagery, the students build a functioning society, complete with
governance, law, and the social compromises necessary for communal
survival. It is Heinlein at his most optimistic and most instructive,
a story that trusts its young protagonists to be competent, resourceful,
and fundamentally decent. The science is sound, the characters vivid,
and the pacing excellent. Recommended for readers of all ages.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #35 -- November 1955

The autumn chill continues! We are pleased to announce the contents of
our November issue:

"THE CARTOGRAPHER OF SCARS" by Dr. Vincent Koslov -- When a survey
ship discovers a planet whose entire surface is covered in a single,
continent-spanning wound -- as if something vast had clawed the world
open -- the crew must determine whether the wound is geological, or
something else entirely. Koslov at his most awe-inspiring.

"THE REVISIONISTS" by Phyllis Crenshaw -- A time traveler discovers
that someone has been editing the past, making small, precise changes
to historical events that compound over centuries. The edits are
improving the world. The question is: should they be stopped? A
Crenshaw paradox of the highest order.

"THE HOMECOMING" by Agnes Whitfield -- A woman returns to her family
farm after twenty years in space to find that the land has been
transformed by terraforming technology -- and that the transformation
has erased everything she remembered. A quiet, devastating story of
loss and change.

"COLD TRAIL" by Robert "Bob" Finley -- A bounty hunter tracks a
fugitive across the frozen moons of Saturn, and discovers that the
fugitive has a very good reason for running. Finley at full throttle.

Plus: a new story by Arthur Wainwright, letters, reviews, and more.
