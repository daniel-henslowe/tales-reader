TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

The calendar tells us it is November, and across this great nation,
families are preparing to gather around tables and give thanks. We at
Tales from the Future and Beyond are no exception. As we close our
third year of publication -- thirty-five issues, hundreds of stories,
and more reader letters than any editor has a right to expect -- I find
myself in a reflective mood.

Gratitude is a curious emotion. Unlike fear, anger, or even love, it
requires us to look backward -- to acknowledge that something was given,
something was done, some debt was incurred that we may never fully
repay. It is, in a sense, the most temporal of feelings, rooting us in
the past even as we face the future. And that tension -- between what
was given and what we owe, between memory and obligation -- struck me
as rich territory for science fiction.

I put the question to our contributors: What does gratitude look like
across the distances of space and time? What do we owe to those who
came before us, and what do we owe to those who will come after? The
answers they have given me make up, I believe, one of our finest issues.

Margaret Thornton opens our pages with "The Seed Vault," a story of
such quiet power and accumulating beauty that I have read it three times
and found new things in it each time. It is, I think, her masterpiece
to date. Theodore Cain poses a delightfully uncomfortable question in
"Debts Unpaid": can you owe a debt for a favor you never asked for?
Colonel Stanton, a man not known for sentimentality, has written in
"The Veterans' Hospital" his most humane and tender story -- a portrait
of wounded soldiers that will stay with you. Dr. Koslov brings his
characteristic precision to the mathematics of homesickness in "The
Thanksgiving Equation," and the result is unexpectedly moving. Arthur
Wainwright explores the ethics of simulated life in "The Ancestor
Simulation" with his usual philosophical rigor and surprising emotional
depth. And Gunnar Eriksson closes our issue with "Homefire," a
generation ship story about the meaning of inherited holidays that
is as beautiful and melancholy as we have come to expect from our
Swedish contributor.

Six stories. Six meditations on what we owe and what we remember. I am
thankful for each one.

And I am thankful for you, reader. A magazine is nothing without its
audience, and you have given us three years of your attention, your
letters, your corrections (some more gentle than others), and your
loyalty. Whatever the future holds, we will meet it together.

Pass the turkey. The future can wait an hour.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond

                          THE SEED VAULT

                       by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                               I.

The door had not been opened in three hundred and twelve years.

Dr. Asa Lindqvist knew this because the seal log said so -- a small
digital counter embedded in the steel frame of the outer blast door,
powered by its own dedicated radioisotope battery, designed to outlast
everything except the mountain itself. The counter displayed two numbers:
the date of last opening (March 14, 2031) and the number of days since
(113,880). Asa did the arithmetic in her head, the way her mother had
taught her, and arrived at three hundred and twelve years. Three hundred
and twelve years since anyone had stood where she was standing, in the
hundred-meter access tunnel cut into the permafrost of a mountain on the
island of Spitsbergen, seventy-eight degrees north latitude, in what had
once been the Kingdom of Norway.

The air in the tunnel was cold -- not the biting, wind-driven cold of
the surface, but a deep, geological cold that seeped through the rock
itself and settled into the body with the patience of something that had
been waiting a very long time. Asa's breath plumed white in the beam of
her headlamp. The walls of the tunnel were rough-hewn granite, still
bearing the marks of the boring machines that had cut them in the late
2000s. Here and there, crystals of hoarfrost had formed on the stone
-- tiny, perfect structures that glittered in the light like the
ornaments of a cathedral no one had visited in centuries.

Behind her, at the tunnel's entrance, Asa could hear the voices of her
team -- Petter Halvorsen, the structural engineer, and Marit Dahl, the
climate historian -- conferring over the atmospheric readings. The
tunnel's internal atmosphere was stable: minus eighteen degrees Celsius,
low humidity, oxygen concentration at twenty percent. Breathable, if
barely comfortable. The vault's designers had planned for exactly this
-- an environment cold enough to preserve genetic material for millennia,
warm enough for brief human access.

"Pressure differential is negligible," Petter called from behind her,
his voice flattened by the acoustics of the tunnel. "The inner seals
should release without forcing."

Asa nodded, though he could not see her. She placed her gloved hand on
the door's surface. The steel was so cold that she could feel it through
the insulated fabric, a chill that traveled up her arm and settled
somewhere behind her sternum. She thought of the seeds on the other side
of this door. Hundreds of thousands of them -- millions, perhaps, if the
catalogues were accurate -- each one a compressed archive of genetic
information, a set of instructions for building a living thing from
sunlight and water and soil. Seeds of wheat and rice and maize, of
barley and millet and sorghum, of vegetables and fruits and legumes
whose names had not been spoken aloud in centuries. Seeds from a world
that had fed eight billion people and then, in the span of two
generations, had ceased to be able to feed itself.

She entered the access code -- a twenty-digit alphanumeric sequence that
had been transmitted from the Svalbard Reconstruction Authority in
Longyearbyen, itself only three years old, itself a product of the slow,
painful process of rebuilding that was the only story anyone alive could
remember. The keypad accepted the code. A series of mechanical locks
disengaged with heavy, precise sounds -- clunk, clunk, clunk -- like the
tumblers of a safe designed by people who took permanence seriously.

The blast door swung inward on its hinges, and the air that came through
was the oldest air Asa had ever breathed.

                               * * *

The Svalbard Global Seed Vault had been established in 2008, though its
origins reached back further, into the long history of humanity's
attempts to preserve the biological diversity on which its survival
depended. Asa knew this history the way she knew the amino acid
sequences of common grain proteins -- thoroughly, technically, and with
the particular intimacy of a person whose entire professional life had
been organized around a single question: How do we grow food again?

The Collapse -- that inadequate word for the cascade of ecological,
economic, and political failures that had reduced the human population
from eight billion to fewer than six hundred million over the course of
a century -- had destroyed the agricultural systems that had sustained
civilization. The vast monocultures of the twenty-first century, already
fragile, had succumbed to a combination of climate disruption, soil
depletion, pathogen evolution, and the breakdown of the supply chains
that distributed seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides across the globe.
When the supply chains failed, the crops failed. When the crops failed,
the people starved. And when the people starved, the seed banks -- the
carefully maintained collections that held the genetic diversity of ten
thousand years of agriculture -- were abandoned, looted, burned, or
simply forgotten.

All of them except this one.

The Svalbard Vault had survived because it was designed to survive
without human intervention. Its location -- deep inside a mountain on an
Arctic island, far from population centers, accessible only by sea or
air -- had protected it from the worst of the Collapse. Its passive
cooling system, relying on the permafrost rather than electrical power,
had maintained the interior temperature within the required range even
as the permafrost itself retreated and reformed over the centuries. Its
doors, sealed against unauthorized access, had held.

And now Asa was opening them.

                               II.

The interior of the vault was precisely as the old records described it.

Three long chambers, extending back into the mountain like the aisles
of a subterranean church, each lined floor to ceiling with metal
shelving. On the shelves, arranged in orderly rows, were the containers
-- aluminum boxes, sealed with gasketed lids, each labeled with a
barcode and a printed identification tag. Asa's headlamp swept across
them and caught the gleam of metal repeated hundreds of times, thousands
of times, receding into the darkness at the far end of the chamber like
an infinite library of small, identical books.

The silence was absolute. Not the silence of an empty room, which always
contains some trace of the world outside -- traffic, wind, the hum of
electrical systems -- but the silence of deep rock, of geological time,
of a space that had been sealed against sound for three centuries. Asa
felt it press against her eardrums, almost physical in its completeness.

She stepped into the first chamber and read the labels on the nearest
shelf.

TRITICUM AESTIVUM -- Common Wheat. Accession numbers, country of
origin (Pakistan, Turkey, Mexico, Argentina, Kenya, India, dozens more),
date of deposit. The entries were printed in a precise sans-serif font,
black on white, unfaded. Below the wheat: ORYZA SATIVA -- Rice. Below
that: ZEA MAYS -- Maize. The taxonomy of survival, arranged in
alphabetical order on steel shelves in a frozen mountain.

"Asa." Marit's voice came from behind her. She had entered the vault
and was standing at the threshold of the first chamber, her headlamp
casting a cone of light that intersected with Asa's. Her face, above
the collar of her thermal suit, was pale and very still. "It's all
here."

"Yes."

"How much?"

Asa looked down the length of the chamber. The shelves extended at least
forty meters into the mountain. "I don't know yet. Hundreds of
thousands of samples, at minimum. If the catalogue is accurate --"

"The catalogue is three hundred years old."

"The seeds are older than that. Some of them. The oldest deposits
predate the vault itself -- seeds from collections that were established
in the 1920s and 1930s." Asa paused, aware that her voice had taken on
the careful, measured tone she used when explaining something important
to people who did not yet understand why it was important. "This is the
largest intact collection of agricultural genetic material on Earth,
Marit. It may be the only intact collection. Everything else was lost."

Marit was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "Can they still grow?"

It was the question. The only question that mattered. Seeds were
remarkable structures -- evolved over four hundred million years to
endure drought, cold, and the passage of time -- but they were not
immortal. Viability declined with age, with temperature fluctuations,
with moisture, with radiation. Three centuries was a long time. Too
long, perhaps.

"Some of them," Asa said. "The orthodox seeds -- the ones that can
withstand desiccation -- should still be viable, at least in part. Wheat,
rice, barley, most of the legumes. The recalcitrant species -- the ones
that require moisture -- will be dead. Cacao, coconut, mango. Those are
gone."

She did not say what she was thinking, which was that "some of them"
might mean ten percent, or five percent, or one percent. That even the
orthodox seeds, stored at optimal temperature, would have lost viability
at a rate of roughly one percent per year in some species. That three
hundred years might have reduced the most critical collection on Earth
to a shelf full of inert husks. She did not say this because she could
not yet bear to think it.

"Let's begin the assessment," she said.

                               III.

It was on the third day that Asa found the journal.

The viability testing had begun on the first morning. The procedure was
painstaking: select a sample container, open it under controlled
conditions, remove a measured portion of seeds, subject them to the
standard germination protocol -- controlled moisture, temperature, and
light -- and wait. The waiting was the hardest part. Some species would
germinate in days. Others took weeks. And the results so far had been
mixed. The wheat samples from the 2020s deposits showed a germination
rate of roughly forty percent -- lower than hoped, higher than feared.
The rice was more variable, ranging from twelve percent to sixty-three
percent depending on the variety and the date of deposit. The barley
was strong. The sorghum was disappointing.

Asa recorded each result in her own notebook, a bound volume of acid-
free paper that she had carried from the genetics laboratory in Bergen.
She wrote in pencil -- the old way, the way that did not require
electricity or functional circuitry -- noting the accession number, the
species, the sample size, the germination count, and the date. Her
handwriting was small and precise, a mirror of the meticulous nature
that had made her the obvious choice for this expedition.

On the third afternoon, while testing a batch of rye samples from the
second chamber, she noticed something behind the containers on the
lowest shelf. A shape that did not conform to the regular geometry of
the aluminum boxes. She reached behind the containers and her fingers
closed on something soft -- fabric, or leather -- with a rectangular
solidity underneath.

She pulled it out. It was a book. A hardcover notebook, bound in dark
brown leather, about twenty centimeters by fifteen, its cover stained
and worn but intact. The leather was cold and stiff but had not
deteriorated -- the freezing temperature had preserved it as effectively
as it had preserved the seeds.

Asa opened it. The pages were filled with handwriting -- a neat, upright
script, written in blue ink that had faded to a pale gray-blue, still
legible in the beam of her headlamp. The first page read:

     JOURNAL
     Ingrid Solvang
     Curator, Svalbard Global Seed Vault
     November 2028 — ?

Asa turned the page.

                               IV.

     November 3, 2028

     I have decided to begin this journal, though I am not certain
     anyone will read it. The communications array failed ten days ago
     -- the satellite uplink has been intermittent for months, and now
     it has stopped entirely. I can still receive fragmentary broadcasts
     on the shortwave, but transmission is impossible. I am, for all
     practical purposes, alone here.

     I should explain who I am and why I am here, in case the reader
     does not have access to the operational records. My name is Ingrid
     Solvang. I am fifty-three years old. I have been the curator of
     the Svalbard Global Seed Vault since 2024, when my predecessor,
     Dr. Arnulf Eng, died of influenza during the second pandemic. I
     am trained as an agronomist, specializing in cereal crop genetics.
     I am the only person remaining at the vault facility.

     The situation on the mainland, as far as I can determine from the
     fragments I receive on the shortwave, is very bad. The harvest
     failures in Central Asia and sub-Saharan Africa that began in 2025
     have not been reversed. The wheat blight has reached Europe. The
     political systems that once coordinated international responses to
     crises of this scale have largely ceased to function. I heard a
     broadcast last week from what appeared to be a military government
     in Oslo, issuing directives about food rationing. I have not heard
     from the Norwegian Ministry of Agriculture since August.

     I do not know if anyone is coming. I do not know if anyone can
     come. The supply ship that was scheduled for October did not arrive.
     I have food stocks sufficient for approximately eight months,
     assuming careful rationing. After that, I will have a problem.

     But the vault is intact. The seeds are safe. The temperature is
     stable. The permafrost is holding. Whatever is happening in the
     world outside, the vault is doing what it was designed to do. It
     is keeping the seeds alive.

     I will continue to do the same.

Asa read this entry sitting on the cold floor of the second chamber,
her back against the shelving, the notebook open on her lap. She read
it twice, and then she turned the page and read the next entry, and the
next. The entries came at irregular intervals -- sometimes daily, sometimes
with gaps of weeks. The handwriting remained steady, controlled, even as
the content grew increasingly isolated, increasingly solitary, increasingly
strange.

     November 29, 2028

     It occurs to me that I should be cataloguing my emotional states
     as carefully as I catalogue the seed inventory. Loneliness: present,
     moderate, manageable. Fear: present, low-grade, concentrated in the
     early morning hours when the wind sounds like voices. Purpose:
     strong. The seeds need a keeper. I am the keeper. This is a simple
     equation.

     I have begun talking to the seeds. I know this sounds eccentric.
     Perhaps it is the beginning of something worse. But the silence here
     is absolute, and human beings were not designed for absolute silence.
     The ear strains for sound the way the eye strains for light in
     darkness -- reaching, reaching, finding nothing, inventing. I would
     rather talk to the seeds than talk to phantoms.

     I told the wheat about wheat. About the fields of it that I saw as
     a child, driving with my father through Hedmark in July -- the way
     it moved in the wind, like the surface of a golden sea, and how I
     thought the entire world must be made of wheat and sky. I told the
     rice about monsoons, which I have never seen but have read about --
     the great seasonal rains of South Asia that turned the paddies into
     mirrors of the sky. I told the maize about a woman I once met at a
     conference in Mexico City, a farmer from Oaxaca who grew seventeen
     varieties of maize in a single field, each one a different color,
     each one with its own name and its own story. The farmer said that
     the maize remembered things. That it carried the memory of everyone
     who had ever planted it.

     I wonder if that is true. I wonder if the seeds can hear me.

                               * * *

Asa did not notice the cold. She did not notice the fading light in her
headlamp, or the stiffness in her legs, or the passage of time. She
read as a person reads when the words on the page are doing something to
the interior of the mind that cannot be interrupted -- reshaping it,
opening chambers that had been sealed, filling empty spaces with the
sound of a voice that had been silent for three centuries.

The journal continued.

     January 15, 2029

     The shortwave has gone silent. For three days now, nothing. Not
     static -- I would welcome static -- but nothing. The bands are
     empty. I sweep them at regular intervals, twice a day, and hear
     only the hiss of cosmic background radiation, which is not a
     signal but the absence of all signals, the sound of a universe
     that contains, as far as my receiver can determine, no one.

     I am trying not to draw conclusions from this. A failure of
     transmission equipment is not the same as a failure of civilization.
     The world may be perfectly intact and simply unable to broadcast.
     Radios break. Infrastructure decays. It does not mean that everyone
     is dead.

     But I find myself, in the quiet hours, preparing for the possibility
     that no one is coming. Not now, not next year, not ever. That I am
     the last curator of the last seed bank, and that my job is no longer
     to preserve these seeds for a society that will come to retrieve them,
     but to preserve them for a future so distant that I cannot imagine it.
     To be, in effect, a message in a bottle -- addressed to whoever finds
     this place, whenever they find it, and whatever they have become.

     This changes the nature of the work. When I was preserving seeds
     for a functioning civilization, I was a technician. Now I am
     something else. A witness, perhaps. Or a priestess. The vault is
     my temple, and the seeds are my congregation, and the sermon I
     deliver to them every day -- because I have not stopped talking to
     them -- is the story of the world they came from. The world they
     will, if they are fortunate, grow back into.

                               V.

Asa read through the evening and into the night, sitting on the floor
of the vault with her thermal suit drawn tight around her and the
journal balanced on her knees. Petter brought her tea from the portable
stove they had set up in the tunnel, and she accepted it without
looking up. He said something about the temperature data and she nodded.
He left. She read.

Ingrid Solvang's journal covered approximately two and a half years. The
entries grew longer as the months passed, as though the act of writing
were expanding to fill the space left by the absence of human contact.
The early entries were practical, disciplined, focused on the work --
inventory updates, maintenance notes, observations about the permafrost
temperature and the condition of the storage containers. But gradually,
almost imperceptibly, the practical gave way to something else. The
journal became a record not of the vault's condition but of its
curator's interior life -- her memories, her thoughts, her conversations
with the seeds.

And the conversations grew extraordinary.

     April 22, 2029

     I told the sunflowers about Van Gogh today. I described the
     paintings -- the thick, turbulent brushstrokes, the yellows that
     seemed to burn from inside the canvas, the way the flowers in
     the paintings looked more alive than real flowers, as though Van
     Gogh had painted not what sunflowers were but what they wanted to
     be. I told them that a man who was desperately unhappy had looked
     at a flower and seen something so beautiful that he had to paint
     it twelve times, and that the paintings had survived for a hundred
     and fifty years and would survive, I suspect, for a hundred and
     fifty more, long after the last museum has crumbled.

     I realize that sunflowers are not stored in this vault. They are
     not a food crop, strictly speaking, though sunflower oil was once
     a significant agricultural product. But I have begun to speak to
     the seeds as though they are all one audience -- wheat and rice and
     barley and sorghum, listening together in the dark, and I the only
     voice they have heard in years, and perhaps the only voice they
     will hear again. They deserve beauty. Even seeds deserve beauty.
     Especially seeds. A seed is an act of faith. Someone plants it in
     the ground and trusts that the sun will come and the rain will
     fall and the soil will do its work, and that from a thing the size
     of a grain of sand, a plant will rise that will feed a child.
     What is that if not faith?

     June 8, 2029

     Today I told the rice about music. I sang to it -- badly, I am
     sure, but the rice is not a demanding audience. I sang a song my
     mother used to sing, a Norwegian folk song about a girl who waits
     for a sailor to return from the sea. The melody is simple, almost
     childlike, and the lyrics are about patience and hope and the
     conviction that the person you love will come home. I have not
     sung this song in thirty years. I remembered every word.

     Afterward, I sat in the silence and listened to the echo of my
     own voice dying in the stone, and I thought: this is what it means
     to be a seed vault. Not just a place where seeds are stored, but
     a place where everything is stored -- every song, every painting,
     every meal, every act of planting and harvesting and feeding, every
     gesture of care that humans have ever directed toward the living
     world. The seeds carry all of it. They carry it in their genes,
     in the ten thousand years of selective breeding that made wheat
     from a wild grass and rice from a marsh plant and maize from a
     weed called teosinte. Every seed is a history book. Every seed
     is a love letter from the past to the future.

     I am the one reading it aloud.

                               VI.

Asa closed the journal. She sat for a long time in the dark of the
vault, her headlamp switched off, surrounded by the seeds and the
silence and the cold.

She was crying. She recognized this with a detached, clinical awareness
-- the wetness on her cheeks, the constriction in her throat, the
tremor in her hands -- and she did not try to stop it. The tears felt
appropriate. They felt, in the frozen dark of the vault, like the only
adequate response.

Ingrid Solvang had died in this vault. The final entries made that
clear, though they did not describe the death itself -- only the
approach to it, the gradual diminishing of the body's resources as the
food stocks ran out, the careful, measured acceptance of what was coming.

     March 1, 2031

     The food is gone. I have been rationing for months, and now there
     is nothing left. I am not hungry in the way I expected -- the cold
     suppresses appetite, and my body has become efficient, running on
     very little, the way a machine runs on fumes when the fuel tank
     is empty.

     I have thought about leaving the vault. Walking out through the
     tunnel, across the mountainside, down to the shore. But the shore
     is twenty kilometers away, and I do not know what I would find
     there. And if I leave, the vault is unattended. If I leave, no one
     is keeping watch. This should not matter -- the vault was designed
     to function without human oversight, and it has done so admirably.
     But I have come to feel that my presence here means something. Not
     to the seeds, which are indifferent to my company. But to the
     record. To the story.

     Someone was here. Someone stayed. Someone kept talking to the seeds
     until the very end, telling them about the world, keeping the
     memory alive in the only way she could -- by speaking it into
     the dark.

     March 14, 2031

     This will be my last entry. I am going to seal the vault and then
     I am going to sit with the seeds for a while. I want to tell them
     one more thing.

     I want to tell them about spring. Not any particular spring -- not
     a spring I have witnessed -- but the idea of spring, the concept
     of it, the promise embedded in the word itself. The ice breaks. The
     ground softens. The first green shoots push up through the soil,
     thin and pale and astonishingly brave, reaching for a sun they have
     never seen but somehow know is there. This is what seeds do. They
     wait in the dark, and then they grow toward the light.

     I want the seeds to know that the light is still there. That the
     sun still rises. That somewhere above this mountain, above the ice
     and the stone and the three hundred meters of frozen earth, there
     is a sky, and in that sky there is a star, and that star is patient,
     and warm, and waiting.

     Grow toward it.

     Grow toward it.

     — I.S.

                               VII.

Asa did not tell Petter and Marit about the journal. Not immediately.
She placed it back on the shelf where she had found it -- behind the rye
containers, where Ingrid had put it -- and she returned to the viability
testing with a focus that was, if anything, more intense than before.

The results continued to arrive, sample by sample, day by day. Each
germinated seed was a small, silent event -- a cracking of the seed coat,
an emergence of the radicle, a tentative unfurling of the first true
leaf -- that Asa observed with the attention of a woman watching a
resurrection. Because that was what it was. Each seed that germinated
was a thread reconnecting the present to the past, a filament of living
tissue reaching across three centuries of darkness to touch the light
again.

The wheat germinated. Not all of it -- never all of it -- but enough.
Forty percent of the oldest samples. Fifty-five percent of the most
recent deposits. Enough to plant a field. Enough to begin.

The rice germinated. Variable, uneven, some varieties strong and others
barely viable, but present. Alive. Carrying in their genes the patient
labor of generations of farmers who had selected and saved and replanted,
year after year, for ten thousand years.

The barley germinated at sixty-eight percent -- hardy, stubborn,
cold-tolerant barley, the grain that had sustained Northern Europe
through centuries of short summers and long winters. Asa held a
germinated barley seedling between her thumb and forefinger and
studied the pale green shoot, no larger than a match, and thought of
Ingrid Solvang sitting in this same chamber, in this same cold,
talking to this same grain about the world it would grow back into.

"Marit," she said.

Marit looked up from the climate data she was logging.

"I found something. In the vault. I need to show you."

                               VIII.

They read the journal together, Asa and Marit and Petter, sitting on
the floor of the second chamber with the notebook open between them.
They read it in silence, passing it from hand to hand when a page was
finished, and the silence in the vault seemed to deepen around them, as
though the mountain itself were listening.

When they had finished, Petter was the first to speak.

"She died here."

"Yes."

"Alone."

"Yes."

Petter was a large man, practical and unemotional by temperament, the
sort of structural engineer who expressed feelings through the quality
of his welds rather than through words. He looked at the journal in his
hands, and his jaw worked once, and he set it down on the shelf with a
careful gentleness that was, from him, the equivalent of a eulogy.

Marit said, "She kept the record. All the way to the end."

"More than a record," Asa said. "She was talking to the seeds. Telling
them about the world. Telling them what they were waiting for."

"The seeds couldn't hear her."

"No. But it wasn't for the seeds. It was for whoever came after. For
us." Asa paused. She looked at the shelves around her -- the thousands
of containers, the millions of seeds, the concentrated genetic wealth
of ten millennia of human agriculture, preserved in ice and stone and
silence by a woman who had stayed at her post until she had nothing
left. "She was telling us what we owe. What we owe to the seeds, and to
the people who bred them, and to the ten thousand years of work that it
took to turn a wild grass into wheat."

Marit was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "What do we owe?"

Asa picked up the journal. She opened it to the last page and read the
final words aloud, her voice steady in the cold air of the vault.

"Grow toward it."

                               IX.

The expedition lasted three weeks. Asa's team catalogued the vault's
contents, tested representative samples from each major crop category,
and prepared a preliminary viability report for the Reconstruction
Authority. The report was cautiously optimistic. The vault contained
approximately 1.1 million seed samples representing over four thousand
plant species. Of the major food crops, viability rates ranged from
fifteen percent to seventy percent, with an overall average of
approximately forty-two percent. This was sufficient -- barely, but
sufficient -- to begin the process of rebuilding agricultural diversity
on a planet that had lost nearly everything.

Asa wrote the report in the same careful, precise handwriting that
characterized all her work. She included the technical data, the
statistical analyses, the recommendations for prioritizing which
varieties to propagate first. She did not include the journal.

She had considered including it. The journal was a primary historical
document -- a firsthand account of the Collapse as witnessed from one
of its most significant sites. It belonged in the historical record.
Scholars and archivists would want to study it.

But Asa had decided, after reading it a fourth time, that the journal
belonged where it was. In the vault. With the seeds. It was part of the
collection, as surely as the wheat and the rice and the barley. Ingrid
Solvang had placed it there, among the things she was preserving, and
Asa would not remove it.

She did, however, add something of her own.

On the morning of the expedition's last day, before sealing the vault
for what she hoped would be only a brief interim -- until the first
recovery teams arrived to begin the systematic retrieval and propagation
of the collection -- Asa opened her own notebook and tore out a single
page. On it, she wrote:

     Dr. Ingrid Solvang,

     We came. It took three hundred and twelve years, but we came.

     The seeds are alive. Not all of them, but enough. The wheat is
     germinating. The rice is germinating. The barley is strong. We
     are going to plant them. We are going to grow food again.

     You asked the seeds to grow toward the light. They did. They
     waited in the dark for three centuries, and now they are growing.
     You kept them safe. You stayed when everyone else left, and you
     talked to them, and you told them what they were waiting for, and
     you were right. The light was still there.

     I want you to know that we will remember. Not just the seeds,
     but you. What you did. What you gave. You stayed, and you kept
     faith, and you died at your post, and because of you, the future
     has a chance.

     We owe you a debt we cannot repay. We can only do what you asked.

     We will grow toward it.

     — Dr. Asa Lindqvist
     Svalbard Recovery Expedition
     Bergen Genetics Institute
     Year of Reconstruction 3

She folded the page and placed it inside the leather journal, beside
Ingrid Solvang's final entry. Then she closed the journal and returned
it to its place on the shelf, behind the rye containers, where it would
wait -- with the seeds, with the silence, with the cold -- for whoever
came next.

                               X.

The blast door sealed behind them with the same sequence of heavy,
precise sounds -- clunk, clunk, clunk -- and the counter on the frame
incremented by one.

Asa stood in the access tunnel and looked at the closed door. Behind
it, in the dark, 1.1 million seeds waited. They had been waiting for a
very long time, and they would wait a little longer. But not much
longer. The first propagation facility was already under construction
in Bergen, its greenhouses rising from the rubble of the old university
campus, their glass panels catching the thin autumn light. Within a
year, the first seeds from the vault would be planted in controlled
conditions. Within five years, if all went well, the first field trials
would begin. Within a generation -- if the weather held, if the soil
could be restored, if the pathogens could be managed, if the thousand
fragile links in the chain of agriculture could be reassembled one by
one -- grain would grow again in the fields of Hedmark.

Asa thought of Ingrid Solvang, alone in the dark, talking to seeds that
could not hear her. Telling them about wheat fields and Van Gogh and
Norwegian folk songs. Telling them about spring.

She thought of the seeds themselves -- patient, desiccated, dormant,
carrying inside their tiny structures the genetic memory of ten thousand
years of human care. Waiting. Just waiting. As they had always waited,
through droughts and floods and wars and plagues and the long, dark
centuries of the Collapse. Waiting for someone to put them in the ground
and give them water and stand back and let them do the thing they had
evolved to do.

She thought of the barley seedling she had held between her fingers --
that pale green filament, barely visible, pushing up from the split
seed coat with a force that seemed impossible for something so small.
Growing toward the light. As it had always grown. As it would always
grow, as long as there was light to grow toward.

The air in the tunnel was cold. The mountain was silent. The vault was
sealed.

Asa turned and walked toward the entrance, toward the gray Arctic light
that filtered in from the surface, toward the sound of wind and the
distant crash of waves on the shore of Spitsbergen.

Behind her, in the dark, the seeds waited.

They had been patient for three hundred years.

They could be patient a little longer.

                            [THE END]

                          DEBTS UNPAID

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

The bill arrived on a Tuesday, which is the sort of thing that happens
to ordinary people on ordinary days, and that was part of the problem.

Frank Jessup was an accountant. Not a senior partner or a financial
wizard or any of the glamorous subspecies of the profession, but a
working accountant with a desk at Halloran & Webb, a firm in downtown
Cleveland that handled tax returns for midsized manufacturing companies.
He was forty-four years old, slightly overweight, divorced, and in
possession of a two-bedroom apartment on Euclid Avenue, a Ford sedan
with seventy thousand miles on it, and a cat named Leonard who did not
like him very much. His life was, by any reasonable measure, unremarkable.

The bill changed that.

He found it in his mailbox on the way home from work, tucked between
a telephone bill and a circular from a carpet cleaning service. The
envelope was unusual -- heavier than normal stationery, a pale blue-gray
color that he had never seen in paper before, and smooth to the touch
in a way that felt less like paper and more like something organic. A
leaf, maybe, or a piece of very thin skin. The address was typed --
MR. FRANK JESSUP, 1847 EUCLID AVE, APT 4-B, CLEVELAND 15, OHIO -- in
characters that were recognizably English but subtly wrong, as though
the typewriter had been designed by someone who understood the Roman
alphabet intellectually but had not grown up with it.

There was no return address. The postmark was illegible.

Frank opened the envelope in his kitchen, standing at the counter while
Leonard watched from the top of the refrigerator with an expression of
practiced indifference. Inside was a single sheet of the same blue-gray
material, folded twice, on which the following was printed:

     INVOICE

     To:       The Species Homo Sapiens
               (Earth, Sol System, Orion Arm, Milky Way Galaxy)
               Attention: Any Authorized Representative

     From:     The Archival Bureau of the Kedathi Cooperative
               (Coordinates Redacted)

     Re:       Services Rendered — Asteroid Deflection
               Date of Service: Approx. 65,000,000 Terrestrial Years Ago

     Description:

     On the above date, a navigational survey vessel of the Kedathi
     Cooperative detected a carbonaceous asteroid of approximately
     10.6 km diameter on a collision trajectory with the third planet
     of your solar system (hereafter "Earth"). Routine impact modeling
     indicated that the collision, if permitted, would result in a
     mass extinction event affecting approximately 76% of existing
     species, including the total elimination of the dominant
     macrofaunal clade (large archosaurian reptiles).

     The Kedathi vessel commander, acting under standing Cooperative
     directive 7791-A (Preservation of Developing Biospheres), authorized
     the expenditure of navigational resources to deflect the asteroid
     from its collision course. The deflection was executed successfully.
     The asteroid passed within 0.3 AU of Earth without impact.

     Per Cooperative billing protocol, the cost of this service has
     been calculated and is presented below.

     ITEMIZED CHARGES:

     Deflection energy (gravitational tractor, 340 hr)....... 4,200 GU
     Fuel expenditure (antimatter reserve draw).............. 12,800 GU
     Navigational recalculation (deviation from survey route).. 890 GU
     Crew overtime (7.2 Kedathi standard work-cycles)......... 2,100 GU
     Administrative filing (Form 7791-A, incident report).....   45 GU
     Interest (65,000,000 years at 0.0001% compound)... 1.72 x 10^28 GU

     TOTAL DUE: 1.72 x 10^28 Galactic Units

     Payment terms: Upon receipt. Sincerely appreciated.

     NOTE: 1 Galactic Unit = approximately 3.7 x 10^15 kilowatt-hours,
     or the total energy output of your sun over a period of
     approximately 3.2 seconds.

Frank read the bill twice. Then he turned it over, checking for
something -- a punchline, a logo, an explanation. The reverse side was
blank. He held the paper up to the kitchen light and saw no watermark,
no impression, no indication that it was anything other than exactly
what it appeared to be: an invoice, addressed to the human race, for
the prevention of an extinction-level asteroid impact sixty-five million
years ago.

The total amount due, if Frank's arithmetic was correct, was
approximately equivalent to the entire energy output of the sun over a
period of several billion years.

"Leonard," Frank said to the cat. "I think we have a problem."

Leonard yawned and began washing his paw.

                               * * *

Frank did what any reasonable accountant would do. He called his
supervisor.

"Jim, it's Frank Jessup."

"Frank. It's eight-thirty at night."

"I know. I'm sorry. I need to ask you something. Has the firm ever
received any correspondence from -- this is going to sound strange --
an organization called the Kedathi Cooperative?"

There was a pause. "The what?"

"The Kedathi Cooperative. They've sent an invoice."

"An invoice for what?"

"For deflecting an asteroid. Sixty-five million years ago."

A longer pause. "Frank, are you drinking?"

"No. I'm reading a bill. It was in my mailbox."

"Frank, go to bed. If some crank is mailing you joke invoices, throw it
away. I'll see you tomorrow."

Frank hung up. He looked at the bill again. He looked at the envelope.
He held the paper to his nose and smelled it. It smelled like nothing
he had ever smelled before -- a faint, dry scent, not unpleasant, like
crushed minerals or the inside of a stone.

He did not throw it away.

                               * * *

The second bill arrived a week later. It was identical to the first,
with one addition: a line at the bottom that read, SECOND NOTICE —
PLEASE REMIT PROMPTLY. Frank would have dismissed both as an elaborate
prank, except for two things. First, the paper. He had taken the first
bill to a materials testing lab at Case Western Reserve University,
where a bemused graduate student had analyzed a small sample and
reported that it was composed of a cellulose-like polymer of no known
terrestrial origin. "It's like paper," the student said, "but it's not
paper. The molecular structure is different. It's engineered."

Second, the bills were not only arriving for Frank.

On the morning after the second bill appeared in his mailbox, Frank
turned on the radio and heard a news report that stopped him mid-shave.
Identical invoices, the reporter said, had been received by the
Secretary-General of the United Nations, the President of the United
States, the Premier of the Soviet Union, the Prime Minister of the
United Kingdom, the Prime Minister of India, and approximately four
thousand other individuals across the globe, selected by no discernible
criterion. Farmers in Nebraska. Fishermen in Japan. A schoolteacher
in Lagos. A postal worker in Buenos Aires. Four thousand copies of the
same bill, delivered simultaneously, in envelopes made of a material
that no terrestrial laboratory could identify.

The world was, in the parlance of the newspapers, in an uproar.

                               * * *

The United Nations convened an emergency session. Frank watched parts of
it on the television at Halloran & Webb, the entire office gathered
around the small Philco set that usually showed the ballgame during
lunch hours. The General Assembly chamber was packed. Delegates spoke
in urgent, overlapping voices. Translators struggled with concepts that
had no precedent in any human language.

The Soviet delegate called it a provocation. "This is clearly the work
of a hostile power," he said, "seeking to destabilize international
relations through an elaborate fabrication. The Soviet Union will not
recognize any debt incurred by fictional entities."

The American delegate was more cautious. "The United States is taking
this matter seriously. Our scientific advisors have confirmed that the
material of these communications is not of terrestrial origin. We
cannot dismiss the possibility that they represent genuine contact with
an extraterrestrial intelligence."

The British delegate, characteristically, sought a middle ground. "Her
Majesty's Government proposes the formation of a committee to study the
matter further."

Frank watched all of this from his desk chair, eating a ham sandwich,
and felt the peculiar sensation of being at the center of something
enormous while remaining entirely peripheral to it. He was one of four
thousand recipients. He was not a scientist, a diplomat, or a head of
state. He was an accountant in Cleveland who had been sent a bill he
could not pay, for a service he had not requested, from a creditor he
had never met.

But he was an accountant. And the bill, whatever else it was, was an
accounting document. And Frank Jessup knew how to read an accounting
document.

He went home that evening, cleared the kitchen table, spread the two
bills out side by side, and began to work.

                               * * *

The first thing he noticed was the interest.

The base charges -- the actual cost of deflecting the asteroid -- were,
in Frank's professional opinion, reasonable. Not cheap, certainly. The
energy expenditure was enormous by any terrestrial standard. But the
labor charges (crew overtime for 7.2 work-cycles) and administrative
costs (filing a single form) were modest, even bureaucratically
restrained. If the Kedathi Cooperative were a terrestrial company, Frank
would have said they ran a lean operation.

The problem was the interest. Sixty-five million years of compound
interest, even at a rate of one hundredth of one percent, produced a
number so large that it was effectively meaningless. The base charges
totaled roughly 20,035 Galactic Units. The interest was 1.72 times ten
to the twenty-eighth power. The interest was the bill. Everything else
was rounding error.

Frank knew compound interest. It was the engine of modern finance, the
mechanism by which money grew and debts compounded and fortunes were
built or destroyed over time. And he knew, with the quiet certainty of
a man who had spent twenty years preparing tax returns, that the
interest charge on this bill was, from a purely accounting standpoint,
absurd.

No one charged interest on a debt that the debtor didn't know about.
No one accrued compound interest for sixty-five million years without
ever issuing a statement. No reasonable creditor waited until the
principal was a trivial fraction of the total and then presented the
bill as though the debtor had been deliberately withholding payment.

It was bad billing practice. And Frank Jessup, whatever else he was,
was a man who took billing practice seriously.

He picked up a pencil and began drafting a response.

                               * * *

Frank's letter to the Kedathi Cooperative was three pages long, single-
spaced, and written in the clear, methodical prose of a man accustomed
to communicating with the Internal Revenue Service. He addressed it to
"The Archival Bureau of the Kedathi Cooperative" and placed it in one
of the blue-gray envelopes, which he had kept. He had no mailing
address -- the original correspondence had included none -- so he simply
wrote KEDATHI COOPERATIVE on the front, affixed a six-cent stamp, and
dropped it in the mailbox on the corner of Euclid and East 18th.

He did not expect a response. He received one in four days.

The reply arrived in the same blue-gray paper, in the same subtly
wrong typography. It read:

     Dear Mr. Jessup,

     Thank you for your correspondence dated November 9. Your objections
     regarding the interest calculation have been received and reviewed
     by the Archival Bureau's Accounts Receivable Division.

     We note your argument that compound interest should not accrue on
     debts of which the debtor is unaware. This is an interesting
     position and one that has been raised previously by other species
     in analogous circumstances. The Bureau's standard response is as
     follows:

     Under Kedathi Cooperative billing protocol, the obligation for
     services rendered attaches to the beneficiary species at the
     moment of service, regardless of the beneficiary's awareness. The
     fact that Homo sapiens did not exist at the time of the asteroid
     deflection, and therefore could not have been aware of the service,
     does not extinguish the obligation. The service was performed for
     the benefit of Earth's developing biosphere, of which Homo sapiens
     is a product. You are, in a sense, the dividend on our investment.

     However, we appreciate your diligence in raising this matter, and
     we note that your correspondence is the first formal response we
     have received from any of the 4,012 individuals to whom invoices
     were sent. In recognition of this, the Bureau is prepared to
     discuss terms.

     We await your proposal.

     Regards,
     Kevathi-Un (Accounts Receivable, Third Tier)

Frank read this letter three times. Then he went to the kitchen, poured
himself a glass of milk, sat down, and began to draft a proposal.

                               * * *

The negotiation between Frank Jessup, accountant, of Cleveland, Ohio,
and the Archival Bureau of the Kedathi Cooperative, of coordinates
redacted, lasted six weeks and produced fourteen letters.

It was, in retrospect, one of the most significant diplomatic exchanges
in human history, though it was conducted entirely through the United
States Postal Service and did not involve a single diplomat.

Frank's opening position was simple: the interest should be waived
entirely, on the grounds that no notice of the debt had been provided
to the debtor for sixty-five million years, constituting abandonment
under any reasonable legal framework. The base charges, he conceded,
were legitimate, and he was prepared to discuss a payment plan.

Kevathi-Un's response was equally straightforward: the interest could
not be waived (Cooperative policy), but it could be restructured. The
Bureau was authorized to convert the compound interest to simple
interest, which would reduce the total by a factor of approximately ten
to the twentieth power. Still enormous, but marginally less absurd.

Frank countered. The base charges were incurred sixty-five million years
ago, in a currency (Galactic Units) that had no terrestrial equivalent.
Without an agreed-upon exchange rate, the bill was unenforceable. He
proposed that the parties negotiate a conversion factor based on the
current productive capacity of the human species.

Kevathi-Un agreed to negotiate the conversion factor, but noted that
the productive capacity of Homo sapiens was, by Cooperative standards,
negligible. "Your species," the letter observed, with what Frank
interpreted as gentle amusement, "currently generates less energy than
a moderately active Kedathi household appliance."

Frank was not offended. He had been audited by the IRS. He knew what
real hostility looked like.

Over the next four weeks, through careful, patient, professional
correspondence, Frank and Kevathi-Un arrived at a settlement. The
terms were as follows:

1. The compound interest was waived, in recognition of the failure to
provide timely notice.

2. The base charges were converted to a unit of account pegged to
Earth's annual solar energy capture (a measure proposed by Frank, who
argued that it was the only metric both parties could verify).

3. The resulting obligation was equivalent to approximately 0.01% of
Earth's annual solar energy budget, payable over a period of ten
thousand years.

4. Payment would take the form of a directed energy transmission to
a relay point specified by the Cooperative, at a frequency and
power level within humanity's current technological capacity.

5. In the event that Homo sapiens developed faster-than-light travel
during the repayment period, the remaining balance would be forgiven,
on the theory that a species capable of interstellar travel was
sufficiently advanced to be a net contributor to the Cooperative
rather than a debtor.

Frank wrote the final terms on Halloran & Webb letterhead, signed them,
and mailed them to the Kedathi Cooperative through the corner mailbox.
The confirmation arrived three days later, stamped with an elaborate
seal that resembled a mathematical proof rendered in calligraphy.

                               * * *

The United Nations Committee on Extraterrestrial Obligations, hastily
convened to address the Kedathi invoices, learned about Frank's
negotiation two weeks after it was concluded, when Frank called the
State Department and asked to speak to someone about an interstellar
debt repayment plan.

He was transferred seven times. He held for forty-five minutes. When
he finally reached a person who seemed to understand what he was
talking about, the conversation went like this:

"Mr. Jessup, are you telling me that you -- personally -- negotiated a
settlement with an alien civilization?"

"I negotiated a settlement of an outstanding invoice. That's what I do."

"Through the mail."

"That's how they contacted me. It seemed polite to respond in kind."

"And you agreed to terms on behalf of the entire human species."

"Someone had to. Nobody else was answering their mail."

There was a long silence on the other end of the line. Then the State
Department official said, "Mr. Jessup, I'm going to need you to come
to Washington."

                               * * *

Frank went to Washington. He brought the complete correspondence, his
notes, and a copy of the settlement terms, all neatly organized in a
manila folder. He presented his case to a room full of diplomats,
military officials, and scientists, most of whom regarded him with the
expression of people who have discovered that the fate of civilization
has been placed in the hands of a man who clips coupons from the
Sunday paper.

He was not intimidated. He had, after all, survived an IRS audit in
1951. The combined diplomatic corps of the United States of America
was, by comparison, a friendly audience.

"The settlement is fair," he told them. "The base charges are legitimate
-- they did prevent an asteroid impact. The interest was unreasonable
and has been waived. The repayment plan is manageable. And frankly,
clause five gives us an incentive to develop interstellar travel, which
seems like a good idea anyway."

"You can't negotiate on behalf of the species," said a man from the
State Department.

"I didn't claim to. I responded to a bill. They accepted my response.
If you want to renegotiate, I suggest you write them a letter."

"We've tried. They don't respond to us."

Frank shrugged. "Maybe try being more polite."

The committee debated for six weeks. In the end, they ratified the
Jessup-Kedathi Agreement, as it came to be known, with minor
modifications to the payment schedule and a formal addendum
establishing the United Nations as the responsible party for
administering the repayment.

Frank returned to Cleveland, to his desk at Halloran & Webb, to his
apartment on Euclid Avenue, to Leonard and his television and his ham
sandwiches. He received a letter of commendation from the Secretary-
General of the United Nations, which he framed and hung next to his
diploma from Cleveland State University. He also received a final
letter from Kevathi-Un, which read:

     Dear Mr. Jessup,

     On behalf of the Archival Bureau, I wish to express our
     satisfaction with the resolution of this matter. Your species
     was the first in our records to respond to an invoice with a
     formal dispute rather than panic, military threats, or silence.
     We find this encouraging.

     A personal note, if I may: I have been processing accounts
     receivable for the Cooperative for what you would calculate as
     approximately four hundred thousand years. In that time, I have
     dealt with 1,247 species across 890 star systems. You are the
     first individual in any species to notice the interest calculation
     error.

     It was not, strictly speaking, an error. But it was a test.

     You passed.

     With respect,
     Kevathi-Un

Frank read this letter, folded it, and placed it in the manila folder
with the rest of the correspondence. He looked at Leonard, who was
sitting on the kitchen counter, watching him with the expression of a
creature that has never owed anyone anything and never intends to.

"Well," Frank said. "I guess we're square."

Leonard did not reply. But he did, for the first time in recent memory,
jump down from the counter and rub against Frank's ankle, which Frank
chose to interpret as a gesture of approval, or possibly gratitude,
or possibly just an itch.

He chose not to investigate too closely. Some debts, he had learned,
were better left unexamined.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       THE VETERANS' HOSPITAL

                 by Col. James "Buck" Stanton (Ret.)

================================================================================

                               I.

The hospital was built into the south wall of Tycho Crater, which meant
that the windows of Ward Seven faced the long, gray plain of the Mare
Nubium, and beyond it, the Earth. The Earth hung in the black sky like
a blue lamp that someone had left on in an empty house -- always there,
always the same, always too far away to touch.

Lieutenant Colonel Peter Marsh had been staring at it for nine days.
Not by choice. Choice had very little to do with anything that happened
to Peter Marsh anymore.

He was sitting in the common room of Ward Seven, in a wheelchair that
he did not need (his legs worked fine, it was the rest of him that was
the problem), wearing the pale blue pajamas and robe that the hospital
issued to all its long-term residents. Around him, the other patients
of Ward Seven went about the business of being damaged. Sergeant Kwan
was doing physical therapy at the far end of the room, working his new
prosthetic arm through a series of flexion exercises with the grim
patience of a man who had already lost two arms and was determined not
to lose a third. Corporal Vasquez was reading a paperback novel, holding
it six inches from her face because the flash burns had taken most of
her peripheral vision and the regeneration treatments were slow. Private
Okonjo was sitting by the window, not moving, not speaking, staring at
a point in space that only he could see. Okonjo had been like that since
Epsilon Eridani. Nobody pushed him.

Ward Seven was the long-term ward. The place where they put the ones who
weren't going home on the next transport but weren't ready for a
discharge board either. The ones in between. The ones the doctors were
still figuring out.

Peter Marsh was the one the doctors couldn't figure out at all.

"Marsh." The voice came from behind him. Nurse Captain Elaine Chen,
military nurse, career hospital staff, a small woman with steady hands
and a face that gave nothing away. She had been on Ward Seven for three
years. She had seen everything. "Dr. Osei wants to see you at fourteen
hundred."

"I know."

"You've missed your last two appointments."

"I know that too."

"He's not going to keep rescheduling."

Marsh turned the wheelchair slightly, not to face her but to
acknowledge her presence. "Captain Chen, I can tell you exactly what
Dr. Osei is going to say. He's going to ask me to describe my
symptoms. I'm going to tell him the same thing I've told him the last
eleven times. He's going to write it down, look at his notes, and
tell me he needs more data. Then he's going to schedule another
appointment. I'm saving us both time."

"That's not your call."

"Not much is."

Chen looked at him for a moment with the expression of a nurse who has
spent enough years on a ward to know when a patient is being difficult
and when a patient is in genuine distress, and who can tell the
difference. "Fourteen hundred, Colonel. Be there."

She left. Marsh turned back to the window.

The Earth hung in the sky. Blue and white and impossibly beautiful and
happening right now, and also twelve hours ago, and also next Tuesday.
All at once. That was the problem.

                               II.

The war -- humanity's first interstellar conflict, which the press had
called the Eridani Campaign and the soldiers had called "the mess" --
had lasted fourteen months and produced casualties of a kind that
military medicine had never encountered before.

The enemy -- the Vashkari, a species of uncertain biology and
uncertain motives that had emerged from the direction of Epsilon
Eridani and begun dismantling human mining installations in the outer
solar system -- did not fight the way human enemies fought. They did
not shoot bullets or fire missiles or drop bombs. They did something
else. Something that the physicists were still arguing about and the
veterans didn't have words for.

The best description Marsh had heard came from a private named Kolb,
who had been in the first wave at Rhea Station and who had lost the
ability to distinguish between his own memories and other people's.
Kolb said the Vashkari weapons "unhooked things." Not destroyed them.
Unhooked them. As though the ordinary connections between cause and
effect, between stimulus and response, between this moment and the
next, were held together by tiny invisible hooks, and the Vashkari had
found a way to open them.

Marsh's hooks had been opened at the engagement near Oberon. His
patrol ship, the UNS Blackwood, had taken a direct hit from a Vashkari
weapon -- a pulse of something that was not quite energy and not quite
matter, that passed through the hull without damaging it and through
the crew without killing them, but that left seven of the twelve crew
members permanently altered.

Ensign Torres could no longer form short-term memories. Every fifteen
minutes, she started over. Lieutenant Park could feel the emotions of
everyone within thirty meters, and it was destroying him. Petty Officer
Raines could see electromagnetic spectra that human eyes were not
designed to see, and the visual cortex of his brain was burning out from
the overload.

And Peter Marsh could see time.

Not metaphorically. Not in the way that people spoke loosely about
"seeing" the future or "remembering" the past. He could perceive
temporal extension the way other people perceived spatial extension.
He looked at a coffee cup and saw it being manufactured, being filled,
being drunk from, being washed, being dropped and broken, being
swept up and discarded -- all of it at once, layered on top of the
cup's present existence like transparencies stacked on an overhead
projector. He looked at a person and saw them as a child, as an adult,
as an old man, as a corpse, simultaneously. He looked at the Earth
through the window of Ward Seven and saw it green and blue and burning
and frozen and empty and teeming and every other thing it had ever been
or would ever be, all at the same time.

It was not a useful ability. It was not an ability at all. It was a
condition. A wound that happened to look, from the outside, like a
superpower, but that was in fact a form of perceptual chaos so
overwhelming that on his worst days, Marsh could not eat because the
food on his plate existed in every stage of its existence simultaneously
-- growing in a field, being harvested, being cooked, being eaten,
being digested, being excreted -- and the sight of it made him retch.

The doctors called it temporal dysplasia. They had a name for it, and
a diagnosis, and a file full of test results, and no idea what to do
about it.

                               III.

Dr. Samuel Osei was a military neurologist who had been seconded to the
Tycho Hospital from the Naval Medical Center in Bethesda. He was a
careful, methodical man -- tall, thin, dark-skinned, with rimless
glasses and a way of listening that made patients feel heard even when
he had nothing helpful to say. He had been treating the Vashkari weapon
casualties for eight months and had published three papers on the
neurological effects, none of which contained the word "cure."

Marsh arrived at his office at fourteen hundred, as ordered. The office
was small and institutional -- standard hospital issue, with a desk, two
chairs, and a window that looked out onto the crater floor. Osei was
behind the desk, reading a file. He looked up when Marsh entered.

"Colonel. Thank you for coming."

"Captain Chen didn't give me much choice."

"She has that effect." Osei gestured to the chair. Marsh transferred
from the wheelchair, a process he performed with the ease of long
practice, and sat. "How are you?"

"The same."

"Can you be more specific?"

"I can see the past and the future simultaneously with the present.
The perception is constant and uncontrollable. On a good day, I can
focus on the present tense long enough to hold a conversation. On a
bad day, I can't tell if this conversation has happened yet."

Osei made a note. "Is today a good day or a bad day?"

Marsh looked at the doctor. He saw him as he was now -- mid-forties,
composed, professional. He also saw him as a young medical student,
nervous and earnest, dissecting a cadaver. He also saw him as an old
man, white-haired, sitting in a garden somewhere warm, reading a book.
All three at once, stacked and overlapping, like three photographs
printed on the same sheet of paper.

"Middling," Marsh said.

"I want to try something different today. If you're willing."

"I'm not sure 'willing' applies."

Osei set down his pen. "Colonel, I'm going to be direct with you. I
have no treatment for your condition. I have no medication, no surgery,
no therapy that I can offer you with any confidence that it will help.
The Vashkari weapon did something to the temporal processing centers of
your brain that I do not fully understand, and I cannot fix what I do
not understand."

"I know."

"But I've been studying your case -- all of the dysplasia cases -- and
I've noticed something. The patients who are coping best are the ones
who have found a way to use their condition rather than fight it. Torres,
in Ward Three -- she's started keeping a journal. She writes herself
notes every fifteen minutes. It doesn't fix her memory, but it gives
her a thread to follow. Raines is working with the astrophysics team,
using his expanded visual perception to analyze stellar spectra. It
still hurts him, but it hurts less when it has a purpose."

"You're suggesting I find a purpose for seeing time."

"I'm suggesting you stop trying to see only the present. You can't.
Your brain won't let you. So instead of fighting the river, try
swimming in it."

Marsh was quiet for a long moment. Outside the window, the crater floor
stretched away to the horizon, gray and silent and the same as it had
been for a billion years. He could see that billion years, or a
fraction of it -- the slow accretion of dust, the occasional flare of
an impact, the patient geological patience of a world that had never
been alive. The Moon's temporal landscape was mercifully simple. It
helped.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked.

"Talk to the other patients. Not as a therapist -- you're not trained
for that. But as someone who sees things differently. Literally
differently. You can see where they've been and where they're going.
Maybe that's useful. Maybe it isn't. But I'd like you to try."

"You want me to be a counselor."

"I want you to be a person who talks to other people. Start there."

                               IV.

Marsh began with Private Okonjo.

David Okonjo had been a communications specialist aboard the destroyer
UNS Halsey during the engagement at Titan. The Halsey had been hit by
three Vashkari pulses in succession, and when the damage teams reached
the communications bay, they found Okonjo seated at his console, alive,
uninjured, and unable to speak. Not physically unable -- his vocal cords
were intact, his brain showed no lesions, his language centers appeared
to function. He simply did not speak. He had not spoken a word in four
months.

The doctors called it psychogenic mutism. The diagnosis was technically
accurate and practically useless. Okonjo sat by the window, stared at
nothing, ate when food was placed in front of him, slept when the lights
were dimmed, and otherwise did nothing at all. He was twenty-two years
old.

Marsh wheeled himself over to the window where Okonjo sat. The private
did not acknowledge him. Marsh positioned himself beside the younger
man and looked out the window at the Mare Nubium.

He did not speak immediately. He sat and let his perception expand,
let the temporal layers unfold. He looked at Okonjo, and he saw him.

He saw a boy of eight or nine, laughing, chasing a ball across a
dusty yard. Lagos. The quality of the light was unmistakable -- golden,
equatorial, the light of a place close to the center of the world. The
boy was fast and happy and completely unaware that he would one day sit
in a wheelchair on the Moon, staring at nothing, with the words locked
inside him like seeds in a vault.

He saw a young man in dress blues, proud and nervous, shaking hands
with an officer at a graduation ceremony. The uniform was new and stiff.
The smile was enormous.

He saw the moment on the Halsey. The pulse. The way the air seemed
to crystallize for an instant, as though reality itself had hiccupped.
And Okonjo at his console, hearing something -- a sound, a signal, a
transmission from the Vashkari that had come through the communications
array and gone straight into his brain and filled it with so much
meaning, so much information, so much alien context, that human language
had become too small to contain what he now knew.

Marsh saw this, and he understood.

"You're not silent because you can't speak," Marsh said, quietly.
"You're silent because the thing you need to say doesn't fit into
words."

Okonjo did not move. But something shifted in his eyes -- a flicker,
like a match struck in a dark room.

"I know what that's like," Marsh said. "Not the same thing. But close.
I can see time. All of it, all at once. And there's no way to describe
it to someone who can't. It's like trying to explain color to a blind
man. The words aren't the wrong words -- there aren't any words. The
experience is bigger than language."

Okonjo's hands, resting on the arms of his chair, twitched. A small
motion. Almost nothing.

"Here's what I can tell you, though," Marsh said. "I can see your past.
And I can see some of what's ahead. Not all of it -- the future is less
clear, like a landscape in fog. But I can see enough. And what I see
is that you're not stuck here forever. You're going to find a way to
say what you need to say. Maybe not in English. Maybe not in any human
language. But you'll find a way."

He did not know if this was true. The future, as he perceived it, was
probabilistic -- a smear of possibilities rather than a fixed line.
But one of those possibilities showed Okonjo speaking. Showed him
at a desk, writing something in a notebook, his hand moving fast, the
words pouring out in a script that was not quite any alphabet Marsh
recognized. And the expression on his face, in that possible future,
was relief.

"Don't force it," Marsh said. "Let it come when it comes."

He sat with Okonjo for another hour, in silence. When he finally
wheeled himself away, the private's hands were still.

But his eyes had changed. The blankness was gone. Something was there
now -- dim, uncertain, but present. Like a light behind a closed door.

                               V.

Over the next two weeks, Marsh talked to every patient on Ward Seven.

He talked to Sergeant Kwan, who was learning to use his prosthetic arm
and who raged against its clumsiness, its failure to be the arm he had
been born with. Marsh sat with him during a therapy session and watched
the mechanical fingers struggle to pick up a plastic cup, and he said,
"I can see the arm you had. I can see the one you have. And I can see
what this one is going to become. You're going to play the piano with
that hand, Sergeant. Not tomorrow. Not next month. But you're going to
play."

Kwan looked at him with suspicion. "I didn't play before."

"You will now. Trust the arm. It's better than you think."

He talked to Corporal Vasquez, who was terrified that the regeneration
treatments would fail and she would be blind within a year. Marsh saw
her timeline and told her the truth: "The treatments are working. Your
vision is going to stabilize. You're going to lose some of the
periphery permanently -- about twenty degrees on each side. You'll
compensate. You'll adapt. You'll read books again."

She cried. He let her cry. He did not tell her that he could see her
tears falling and drying and the salt crystals they left on her cheeks,
all at once, because some things were not helpful.

He talked to Lieutenant Park, the empath, who was drowning in other
people's emotions and who spent most of his time in a private room with
the door closed, trying to reduce the input to manageable levels. Marsh
could not see emotions -- only time -- but he could see Park's timeline,
the long slow arc of his adaptation, and he told him: "You're going to
learn to filter. It's going to take about a year. There's going to be a
bad stretch around month four when you'll want to give up. Don't. On
the other side of that stretch, it gets quieter."

"How do you know?" Park asked.

"I can see it."

"Can you see if I'll ever be normal again?"

Marsh looked at him. He saw the young officer as he was and as he would
become. The future-Park was not normal. He would never be normal. But
he was functional, and more than functional -- he was using his ability,
channeling it, turning the curse into something that looked, from a
certain temporal angle, almost like a gift.

"You won't be what you were," Marsh said. "But you'll be something.
Something useful. Maybe something better."

Park looked at him for a long time. Then he nodded, once, and closed
his door.

                               VI.

It was Chen who told Marsh what was happening.

"You're changing them," she said. It was evening. The ward was quiet.
Chen had finished her rounds and had stopped by the common room, where
Marsh was sitting in his usual spot by the window, watching the Earth.

"I'm talking to them."

"You're doing more than that. Kwan asked the PT staff for a piano.
Vasquez is reading again. And Okonjo--" She paused. "Okonjo wrote
something today. In his notebook. First time in four months."

Marsh looked at her. "What did he write?"

"The nurses couldn't read it. It's not English. It might not be any
human language. But he wrote it. He picked up a pen and he wrote."

Marsh felt something shift in his chest. It was not a temporal
perception. It was something simpler and older: a feeling. Relief,
maybe. Or gratitude.

"I'm not doing anything," he said. "I'm just telling them what I see."

"What you see is what they need to hear. That they have a future. That
the damage isn't permanent. That they're going to be something on the
other side of this." Chen's voice was steady, professional, but
something flickered in her expression -- something that looked, for
just a moment, like wonder. "You can't know that, Colonel. Not really.
The future isn't fixed."

"No," Marsh agreed. "It's not. But it's there. I can see the shape
of it, even if I can't see the details. And the shape is -- hopeful.
For most of them. Not for all. Some of them are going to struggle for
a long time. Some of them aren't going to make it. But most of them
are going to come through."

"And you?"

The question landed in the quiet of the common room like a stone in
still water. Marsh looked at her, and then he looked at the Earth,
blue and white and burning and frozen, all at once.

"I don't look at my own timeline," he said.

"Why not?"

"Because I'm afraid of what I'll see." He paused. "And because I'm
afraid I won't see anything at all."

Chen was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "That's the first honest
thing you've said since you got here."

Marsh almost smiled. "Don't tell Osei. He'll want to write a paper."

                               VII.

The weeks passed. Marsh continued his rounds -- that was what the staff
called them now, his "rounds," as though he were a doctor rather than
a patient -- and the ward continued to change. Not dramatically. Not
overnight. But steadily, the way a landscape changes when the light
shifts: the same shapes, the same features, but illuminated differently,
revealing contours that had been there all along but hidden in shadow.

Kwan played the piano. Badly, at first -- the prosthetic arm was
clumsy, and the fingers had not been designed for delicate keywork.
But he played. He started with scales, moved to simple melodies, and
one evening, sitting at the battered upright in the common room, he
played a passage from a Chopin nocturne -- three measures, halting and
imperfect, the mechanical fingers stumbling on the grace notes -- that
stopped every conversation in the room and drew tears from two nurses
and a doctor who happened to be passing by.

Vasquez finished her novel and started another. She still held the book
close to her face, but she held it with the easy confidence of someone
who had accepted her limitations and found a way to work within them.

Park began spending time in the common room instead of behind his
closed door. He said it was easier with Marsh nearby -- Marsh's
emotional state was, Park said, unusually stable, almost monotone,
and being near him was like standing next to a breakwater in a storm.
"You're the calmest person I've ever met," Park told him.

"It's not calm," Marsh said. "It's just that everything has already
happened, for me. It's hard to be anxious about the future when you
can see it."

And Okonjo wrote.

He wrote constantly now -- pages and pages in his notebook, in a
script that no one on Ward Seven could read. The linguists in the
hospital's research division studied samples and concluded that it
was not any known human language or writing system. It appeared to be
a hybrid -- elements of Igbo, elements of English, elements of
something else entirely, something that might have been derived from
the Vashkari transmission that had overwhelmed his communications
console and rewired his language centers.

Okonjo still did not speak. But he wrote, and the act of writing seemed
to open a valve that had been sealed shut, and the pressure behind it
was enormous. He filled one notebook, then another, then a third. He
wrote at meals, he wrote during recreation hours, he wrote at night
by the dim light of the ward's emergency fixtures, his pen moving
across the page with a fluency that bordered on urgency.

Marsh watched him and saw, in the layers of his temporal perception, a
future in which what Okonjo was writing would be studied, translated,
argued about, and ultimately recognized as the first record of an alien
communication ever transcribed by a human mind. The private who could
not speak was writing a Rosetta Stone.

"He doesn't know what he's writing," Marsh told Osei, during one of
their now-regular sessions. "Not consciously. But it's in there -- the
Vashkari signal, the message, whatever it was. It's coming out."

"And what does it say?"

"I can't read it either. But I can see the effect it has. Downstream.
In the future." Marsh paused, searching for words that could contain
what he saw. "It's going to matter. What he's writing is going to be
important. I don't know how. I can't see the details. But the shape
of the future changes around those notebooks. They're a weight, a
mass -- they bend the timeline the way a star bends light."

Osei was quiet. Then he said, "Colonel, do you realize what you're
describing?"

"I'm describing what I see."

"You're describing hope. You're the most damaged patient on this ward,
and you're describing hope."

Marsh looked at the doctor, and for the first time since the engagement
at Oberon, he laughed. It was a short laugh, rough and unused, but it
was a laugh.

"I guess I am," he said. "Don't hold it against me."

                               VIII.

On a Thursday evening in November, Marsh wheeled himself to the window
of the common room and looked at the Earth. It was Thanksgiving, back
in the United States. He knew this because Captain Chen had mentioned
it during rounds, and because the hospital kitchen had made a credible
attempt at turkey and stuffing, which the patients had eaten with the
dutiful gratitude of people who appreciated the gesture even if the
food was institutional.

The ward was quiet. Most of the patients had turned in early. Kwan
was asleep in his chair, his prosthetic arm resting on the piano keys.
Vasquez had gone to bed with her book. Park was in his room, the door
open for the first time in weeks, which Marsh took as a good sign.
Okonjo was writing.

Marsh looked at the Earth and, for the first time in months, he did
not try to filter his perception. He let it open. He let himself see
everything.

He saw the Earth as it was: blue and white and spinning, alive with
seven billion people going about the business of living. He saw it as
it had been: a ball of molten rock, cooling slowly, gathering an
atmosphere, learning to rain. He saw it as it would be: older, quieter,
its continents drifting into configurations that no living human would
recognize, its sun expanding, its oceans evaporating, its biography
written in the language of geology and time.

And he saw, threaded through all of it, the thin, bright filament of
human presence -- impossibly brief against the planetary timeline,
barely a flicker, but there. Burning. Reaching outward. Reaching
toward the stars that had wounded him and that he could not stop looking
at.

He was grateful.

He was grateful for the wound, because it had shown him things that no
undamaged mind could see. He was grateful for the ward, because it had
given him a purpose. He was grateful for the people he sat with every
day -- broken, altered, struggling people who were slowly, painfully,
finding their way back to something that resembled life.

And he was grateful for the Earth, hanging in the dark, unchanged
by his gratitude, indifferent to his perception, beautiful beyond any
frame of time.

He sat by the window for a long time, watching. The past and the future
and the present folded around him like the pages of a book, and for
once, he did not mind.

Behind him, in the quiet ward, Okonjo wrote.

Kwan slept with his mechanical hand on the piano.

Vasquez dreamed of words.

And the Earth turned, as it always had, as it always would, carrying
them all forward into whatever came next.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                     CALORIES OF GRATITUDE

                      by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                               I.

On the morning of November 27th, in the third year of the Kepler-442b
colonial settlement, Dr. Emil Krauss sat down at his desk in the
physics laboratory of Habitat Module Seven and began to calculate the
energy cost of missing his daughter.

This was not, strictly speaking, a sanctioned use of laboratory time.
The physics laboratory existed to support the colony's infrastructure
-- power generation, atmospheric processing, water recycling -- and
its single occupant was expected to devote his working hours to the
maintenance and optimization of these systems. But it was early
morning, the colony was still mostly asleep, and the atmospheric
processors were running within nominal parameters, and Emil had been
thinking about Clara.

Clara was eleven years old, or would be eleven years old today, if the
relativistic corrections were properly applied. She lived on Earth, in
a house in Heidelberg, with her mother, who was Emil's former wife, and
a man named Dieter, who was not Emil and who was, by all reports,
perfectly adequate. Emil had left Earth four years ago -- three years
colony time, four years Earth time, the discrepancy a function of the
velocity-dependent time dilation that the Pavlic drive introduced at
superluminal speeds. He had not seen Clara since the morning of his
departure, when she had stood at the gate of the Heidelberg Spaceport
in a red coat and waved until the transport lifted and she became a dot
and then nothing.

Emil did not think about Clara in the usual way that a separated father
thinks about a distant child. He was a physicist. He thought about her
in terms of energy.

The thought of Clara -- the mental operation of retrieving her image
from memory, holding it in active consciousness, and associating it
with the complex of emotions that the word "daughter" contained --
required a measurable expenditure of metabolic energy. The brain
consumed approximately 20 watts at rest. Active cognition, particularly
emotionally charged cognition, increased this by a factor of roughly
1.2. The act of thinking about Clara, therefore, consumed approximately
24 watts for the duration of the thought.

Emil thought about Clara, on average, fourteen times per day. Each
thought lasted, by his rough estimate, between thirty seconds and three
minutes. Call it ninety seconds per episode, on average. That was 14
episodes multiplied by 90 seconds each, or 1,260 seconds of Clara-
directed cognition per day.

At 24 watts, this yielded a daily energy expenditure of 30,240 joules.
Approximately 7.2 kilocalories. The metabolic equivalent of eating a
single grape.

One grape per day. That was the energy cost of thinking about his
daughter across twelve light-years of interstellar space.

Emil stared at this number. It was absurd. It was trivial. It was a
fraction of a fraction of his daily caloric intake, a rounding error
in the metabolic budget of a seventy-eight-kilogram man. A grape.

And yet.

He opened a fresh page in his laboratory notebook and wrote at the top,
in his small, precise hand:

     ON THE THERMODYNAMICS OF LONGING
     A Preliminary Investigation

                               II.

The colony on Kepler-442b -- designated New Frankfurt by the German-led
settlement consortium, though the residents had already begun calling
it "the Rock" -- was three years old and home to 847 people. It
occupied a series of interconnected habitat modules on the surface of a
rocky world that was, by terrestrial standards, almost but not quite
habitable. The atmosphere was breathable but thin. The gravity was 0.88
Earth normal. The sun -- Kepler-442, an orange dwarf -- provided
sufficient light for photosynthesis but gave it a quality that Emil
could only describe as disappointed, as though the star were trying its
best and knew its best was not quite enough.

The colonists had come from fourteen countries, united by a shared
willingness to spend the rest of their lives on a world that would
never feel like home. They were engineers, biologists, physicians,
agronomists, and one theoretical physicist who had been included in the
expedition roster because someone on the selection committee had decided
that a colony should have someone who could think about the universe in
abstract terms, even if the practical applications were unclear.

Emil had accepted the position for reasons that were, in retrospect,
insufficiently examined. He had told himself it was the opportunity of a
lifetime -- a chance to study astrophysics from the surface of another
world, to observe a different star system from the inside, to contribute
to humanity's greatest adventure. These reasons were true. They were
also incomplete. The complete truth included the fact that his marriage
had ended badly, that his access to Clara had been reduced to alternate
weekends and holidays, that the house in Heidelberg had become a place
of negotiated silences and careful scheduling, and that the stars had
seemed, at the time, like a reasonable alternative to staying.

He had not anticipated the energy cost.

                               * * *

Not just the metabolic cost. The communicative cost.

A message from Kepler-442b to Earth traveled at the speed of light and
took 12.4 years to arrive. A response, assuming it was sent immediately,
took another 12.4 years to return. The round-trip communication time
was 24.8 years. By the time Clara received the message Emil had sent on
the day of his arrival, she would be thirty-two years old.

Emil had sent the message anyway. It was sixty-four words long. He had
written it in German, revised it eleven times, and transmitted it via
the colony's high-gain antenna at a power of 2,400 watts for a duration
of 3.7 seconds.

Sixty-four words. 2,400 watts. 3.7 seconds. A total energy expenditure
of 8,880 joules.

He calculated the energy cost per word. 138.75 joules per word. The
energy equivalent of lifting a one-kilogram mass approximately 14
meters against Earth-normal gravity.

Every word he sent to his daughter cost, in physical terms, the effort
of hoisting a bag of flour to the top of a four-story building.

This, too, seemed absurd. The numbers were objective, verifiable,
anchored in the physics that Emil trusted above all other human
constructs. And yet the numbers, accurate as they were, captured
nothing. They were the skeleton of the thing without the flesh. The
thermodynamics of longing, stripped of the longing itself, reduced to
joules and watts and kilocalories, were as informative as a map of a
country that omitted the people.

Emil knew this. He was a physicist, not a fool. He understood that the
quantities he was measuring were proxies for something that physics
could not measure: the weight of absence, the mass of memory, the
gravitational pull of a person who was twelve light-years away and
growing older at a rate he could not share.

But he kept measuring. Because measurement was what he had. It was
the instrument he had carried with him across twelve light-years, the
tool that worked when nothing else did, the lens through which he could
examine the unexaminable. And because the act of measurement -- of
sitting at his desk, calculating, writing numbers in his notebook --
was itself a form of thinking about Clara, and therefore cost 24 watts,
and therefore fed the equation, and the equation was all he had of her.

                               III.

Over the next several days, Emil expanded his investigation.

He began with the colony's communication logs. Every transmission sent
from Kepler-442b to Earth was recorded -- its duration, its power
output, its content type (text, audio, video), and its intended
recipient. The logs were available to all colony residents as part of
the settlement's transparency protocols, and Emil spent an evening
compiling the data for the previous twelve months.

The results were instructive.

In the past year, the colony had transmitted 4,217 personal messages
to Earth. These ranged in length from a single word ("Safe") to a
forty-minute video letter recorded by an agronomist named Yulia
Petrovna, who narrated a detailed tour of the greenhouse facilities
for her aging father in Novosibirsk. The average message length was
312 words or 4.7 minutes of audio/video. The total energy expenditure
on personal communications was 847,000 kilowatt-hours.

847,000 kilowatt-hours. Directed into space. Aimed at a planet that
none of them could see with the naked eye and most of them would never
visit again.

Emil broke the number down further. On a per-capita basis, each
colonist had spent approximately 1,000 kilowatt-hours per year on
messages home. This was roughly equivalent to the annual electricity
consumption of a small European apartment. Each colonist was, in
effect, powering a phantom apartment on Earth -- a ghost home, built
of electromagnetic radiation, furnished with words and images of
longing, uninhabitable but real.

He computed the efficiency. Of the 847,000 kilowatt-hours transmitted,
how much would actually reach Earth? The inverse-square law was
merciless. The high-gain antenna focused the beam, but over twelve
light-years, even a focused beam spread to a width of several
astronomical units. The receiving antenna on Earth -- the Deep Space
Network array -- would capture a fraction of a fraction of the signal.
The rest would continue outward, into the void, carrying its cargo
of homesickness into the interstellar medium, where it would propagate
until the heat death of the universe without being heard by anyone.

The fraction received was approximately 10^-22. One hundred
sextillionths. A number so small that it bordered on the fictional.

Emil wrote this number in his notebook and looked at it for a long
time.

A hundred sextillionths. That was the efficiency of love across
interstellar distances. That was the fraction of your longing that
actually reached the person you longed for. The rest -- the
overwhelming, staggering, practically-all-of-it rest -- dispersed
into the cosmos, a thin electromagnetic mist of human feeling,
expanding at the speed of light, diluting with distance, becoming
noise, becoming background, becoming nothing.

And yet they kept transmitting.

Every colonist. Every month. Standing at the antenna console, speaking
into the microphone or typing into the text interface, sending their
words and their faces and their love into a void that swallowed
everything and gave back nothing. Knowing -- because they were
intelligent people, scientists and engineers, people who understood the
inverse-square law as well as Emil did -- that almost none of it
would arrive.

They did it anyway.

Emil added a new section to his paper: THERMODYNAMIC EFFICIENCY OF
EMOTIONAL COMMUNICATION ACROSS INTERSTELLAR DISTANCES. He filled three
pages with calculations. Then he put down his pencil, rested his
forehead on his hands, and sat very still.

The numbers were correct. The physics was impeccable. And the conclusion
was devastating: from a strictly thermodynamic perspective, the act of
communicating love across twelve light-years was the most wasteful
thing the colony did. More energy was spent on messages home than on
water recycling, atmospheric processing, and interior heating combined.
The colony's emotional infrastructure consumed more power than its
physical infrastructure.

This was, by any engineering standard, irrational.

It was also, Emil realized, the most important thing the colony did.

                               IV.

The mess hall was the social center of the colony -- a large, low-
ceilinged room in Habitat Module Three that served as cafeteria,
meeting hall, recreation space, and, on this particular evening, the
site of a Thanksgiving dinner.

Thanksgiving was an American holiday, and fewer than a quarter of the
colonists were American. But the Americans had proposed it, and the
non-Americans had accepted it, partly out of courtesy and partly
because the colony had no holidays of its own, and the human need for
structured occasions of collective gratitude was, apparently, not
diminished by relocation to another star system. If anything, it was
intensified. People who have left everything behind develop a keen
appreciation for what remains.

The dinner was modest by terrestrial standards. The colony's
agricultural section had contributed root vegetables, hydroponically
grown greens, and a protein loaf that the cooks had shaped and
seasoned to approximate turkey. The approximation was generous. It
tasted like protein loaf. But it was warm, and it was shared, and
the mess hall was full, and the colonists sat together at long tables
and ate and talked and laughed and did the thing that human beings
have done at communal meals for ten thousand years: they pretended,
for a few hours, that the world was not as hard as they knew it to be.

Emil sat at the end of one of the long tables, eating his protein loaf
and observing. He had his notebook with him -- he always had his
notebook -- and he was making notes.

The caloric content of the meal: approximately 1,800 kilocalories per
person, 847 persons, total caloric expenditure 1,524,600 kilocalories.
The thermal energy produced by 847 human bodies in an enclosed space,
over a three-hour dinner: approximately 360,000 BTUs, sufficient to
raise the temperature of the mess hall by 2.3 degrees Celsius without
supplemental heating. The acoustic energy produced by 847 people
talking and laughing simultaneously: approximately 0.01 watts per
person, total acoustic output 8.47 watts, which was -- Emil calculated
with a faint smile -- roughly one-third of the power consumed by a
standard reading lamp.

Eight and a half watts of human sound. Conversation, laughter, the
clink of utensils, the scrape of chairs. The noise of people being
together. It was barely measurable. It was nothing, in thermodynamic
terms. It would not power a light bulb. It would not heat a room. It
would not reach Earth or Clara or anyone beyond the thin walls of
Habitat Module Three.

And it was everything.

Emil set down his pencil. He looked around the mess hall -- at the
faces, the gestures, the small transactions of attention and response
that constituted a communal meal. Yulia Petrovna was telling a story,
her hands describing shapes in the air, her audience leaning in. The
chief engineer, a taciturn Swede named Bergstrom, was laughing at
something -- actually laughing, his face open and unguarded for the
first time in weeks. A group of children were running between the
tables, chasing each other, shrieking with the pure, context-free joy
that children carried with them like a portable sun.

Emil watched them and thought: the energy cost of this meal, in
strictly thermodynamic terms, is 1.5 million kilocalories, plus
360,000 BTUs of waste heat, plus 8.47 watts of acoustic energy, plus
the electromagnetic cost of the lighting and the atmospheric
processing and the water recycling and all the rest of the colony's
infrastructure that made it possible for 847 people to sit together
in a room on an alien world and eat.

And the thermodynamic yield -- the useful work produced -- was zero.
No power generated. No water recycled. No atmosphere processed. The
dinner was, from a purely physical standpoint, a net loss.

Unless you counted something else.

Unless you counted the thing that Emil had been trying to measure for
days and that kept refusing to fit into his equations: the energy of
being together. The unmeasurable warmth of shared presence. The force
-- and it was a force, he was increasingly certain of this, though he
could not derive it from first principles -- that held 847 people
together in a room twelve light-years from home and made them, for a
few hours, something more than a collection of isolated organisms
burning calories in the dark.

Gratitude, perhaps. Or its thermodynamic equivalent.

                               V.

After the dinner, Emil returned to his laboratory. The colony was
quiet. The overhead lights had been dimmed to simulate evening, and the
corridors of Habitat Module Seven were empty except for the soft hum
of the atmospheric processors and the distant, barely perceptible
vibration of the power plant.

He sat at his desk and opened his notebook. He read through his
calculations, page by page. The metabolic cost of longing. The
electromagnetic cost of communication. The thermodynamic efficiency
of love across interstellar distances. The caloric budget of a
Thanksgiving dinner on an alien world.

The numbers were all correct. Every calculation was rigorous, every
unit conversion verified, every assumption clearly stated. It was,
he thought, a perfectly competent piece of applied thermodynamics.

It was also, he realized, the most personal thing he had ever written.

Not because it was about Clara -- though it was about Clara, in the
way that everything he did was about Clara, the way every thought he
had contained her as a variable, implicit and pervasive, the constant
term in every equation of his daily life. It was personal because the
act of measuring longing had forced him to experience it. He could not
calculate the energy cost of thinking about his daughter without
thinking about his daughter. He could not quantify the inefficiency of
interstellar communication without confronting the fact that his words
would not reach her for twelve years, and that by the time they did,
the little girl in the red coat would be a woman he did not know.

Emil put down his pencil. He took a breath. The air in the laboratory
was dry and recycled and tasted of nothing -- the taste of space,
filtered through machines, stripped of everything that made air feel
like air. He missed the air of Heidelberg. He missed the way it
smelled in autumn, of wet leaves and chimney smoke and the faint,
sweet rot of fallen apples in the neighbors' garden.

He missed Clara.

Not the abstraction of Clara -- not the variable in his equation, not
the caloric cost of her memory, not the 24 watts of cognition she
consumed in his brain. He missed the real Clara. The weight of her on
his lap when she was small. The sound of her laugh, which was sudden
and delighted and which she had inherited from her mother. The way she
drew pictures of rockets and labeled them with misspelled captions --
ROKKIT TO MARS, SPACE SHIP FOR PAPA -- and taped them to the
refrigerator where he would see them when he came home from the
university.

He missed the refrigerator, too. And the kitchen it stood in. And the
house the kitchen was in. And the street the house was on. And the
city. And the country. And the planet.

The hierarchy of longing, he thought. Fractally structured, self-
similar at every scale. You missed the small things and the large
things and everything in between, and the missing was the same at
every level -- the same quality of absence, the same weight of
distance, whether the object of longing was a person or a planet or
the smell of autumn air.

He picked up his pencil and added a final section to his paper.

                               VI.

     CONCLUSIONS

     The total energy expenditure of the Kepler-442b colony on
     activities related to remembrance, communication, and emotional
     connection to Earth is approximately 1.2 million kilowatt-hours
     per year, or roughly 18% of the colony's total energy budget.

     This figure includes: the metabolic cost of memory and longing
     (estimated at 1,850 kilowatt-hours per year, colony-wide); the
     electromagnetic cost of personal communications to Earth (847,000
     kilowatt-hours per year); the energy cost of communal activities
     with no direct survival function (cooking shared meals, maintaining
     recreational spaces, celebrating holidays) (estimated at 350,000
     kilowatt-hours per year); and miscellaneous costs including the
     maintenance of personal effects, photographs, and other artifacts
     of terrestrial origin.

     The thermodynamic efficiency of these activities is, in most
     cases, negligible. The efficiency of interstellar communication,
     measured as the ratio of signal energy received to signal energy
     transmitted, is approximately 10^-22. The efficiency of memory,
     measured as the ratio of metabolic energy consumed to useful work
     produced, is zero. The efficiency of gratitude, measured by any
     metric I can devise, is undefined.

     Undefined, but not zero.

     I am forced to conclude that the thermodynamic framework, while
     correct, is incomplete. There exists a quantity -- call it Q, for
     want of a better symbol -- that enters the energy budget of this
     colony in ways that my instruments cannot measure and my equations
     cannot capture. It is the energy of connection. The force that
     compels 847 people to spend 18% of their total energy budget on
     the maintenance of bonds that span twelve light-years and provide
     no measurable physical benefit.

     Q is not metabolic. Q is not electromagnetic. Q is not thermal,
     kinetic, or potential in any recognized sense. Q is the energy
     that a man expends when he sits at a desk on an alien world and
     calculates the cost of thinking about his daughter, and finds
     that the cost is one grape per day, and knows that he would pay
     a thousand times that and more and never call it a cost at all,
     but a privilege.

     Q is what we carry with us. Q is what we send home. Q is the
     eighteen percent of our energy that we cannot account for and
     cannot do without.

     I do not have a unit for Q. I cannot derive it from first
     principles. I cannot measure it with any instrument in this
     laboratory. But I can report, with the confidence of a man who
     has spent his life in the pursuit of precision, that Q is real.

     It is as real as gravity.

     It is as real as light.

     It is, in fact, the only thing I have measured in this
     investigation that I am certain is worth measuring.

                               * * *

Emil closed his notebook. He sat for a moment in the quiet laboratory,
listening to the hum of the atmospheric processors and the deep, almost
subliminal vibration of the power plant, the mechanical heartbeat of a
colony twelve light-years from home.

Then he stood up, walked to the communications console in the corner of
the laboratory, and sat down. He activated the text interface. He
entered the routing code for Earth, Heidelberg, the address of the
house on Bergstrasse where Clara lived with her mother and Dieter.

He typed:

     Dear Clara,

     Happy birthday. You are eleven today, or you were eleven on the
     day this message was sent. By the time you receive this, you will
     be twenty-three. I am sorry that I cannot give you a present
     across this distance. I can only give you this:

     I calculated the energy it costs me to think of you. It is
     7.2 kilocalories per day, which is the energy content of one
     grape. This is a very small amount. But I want you to know that
     I pay it gladly, every day, without exception.

     I love you. The distance does not change this. The physics does
     not change this. Nothing changes this.

     Your father,
     Emil

He pressed the transmit key. The message entered the antenna array, was
converted to a focused beam of electromagnetic radiation, and left the
planet at 299,792,458 meters per second, aimed at a star so far away
that it was visible from Kepler-442b only as a faint yellow point in
the constellation the colonists had named "The Compass."

The message would arrive in twelve years, four months, and six days.
By then, Clara would be a woman. She would have a life he could not
imagine, built from experiences he would never share. She would read
his message -- sixty-four words, transmitted at 2,400 watts for 3.7
seconds, carrying 138.75 joules per word across the void -- and she
would know that on a world twelve light-years away, her father was
thinking of her.

The energy cost of the transmission was 8,880 joules.

The value was incalculable.

Emil turned off the console, put his notebook in his desk drawer, and
walked to the window of the laboratory. Outside, the surface of
Kepler-442b stretched away under the orange light of its sun -- rocky,
alien, indifferent, beautiful. Above the horizon, in a sky that was
not quite the right shade of blue, the stars were coming out.

One of them was the sun. Clara's sun. The star he had grown up under,
the star that had warmed his face and lit the pages of his books and
made the wheat grow in the fields outside Heidelberg.

He looked at it for a long time.

Then he turned off the light and went to bed.

One grape per day.

It was enough.

                            [THE END]

                      ANCESTOR SIMULATION

                       by Arthur Wainwright

================================================================================

                               I.

The robot's name was Caretaker-7, and it had spent the last four years
reconstructing a human being from fragments.

The fragments were of two kinds. The first was biological: a collection
of DNA samples recovered from a burial site in what had once been the
American Midwest, dated to the early twenty-first century. The samples
were degraded, incomplete, and contaminated by three centuries of
microbial activity, groundwater infiltration, and radioactive decay.
Of the approximately 3.2 billion base pairs that constituted a complete
human genome, the recovered samples contained roughly 43 percent,
distributed unevenly across 19 of 23 chromosome pairs. The gaps had
been filled -- had to be filled -- from a reference database of 2,847
other genomes recovered from the same region and the same approximate
time period.

The result was not a person. It was a composite. A statistical human,
assembled from the genetic material of dozens of individuals and
representing no single one of them.

The second kind of fragment was historical. Caretaker-7 had access to
what remained of the early twenty-first century's digital archive -- a
vast but porous collection of texts, images, audio recordings, and
databases that had survived the electromagnetic disruptions of the
Collapse in partial and corrupted form. From this archive, the robot
had extracted information relevant to its subject: census records, tax
filings, social media posts, medical records, purchase histories,
geolocation data, school transcripts, employment records. Each fragment
was incomplete. Each belonged to a different individual. Together, they
formed a mosaic -- a portrait assembled from pieces of many faces,
recognizable as human but identical to no one who had ever lived.

Caretaker-7 understood this. Its cognitive architecture was designed for
exactly this kind of analytical clarity. It could hold in active memory
the complete provenance of every data point in the reconstruction,
trace each fragment to its source, and calculate the probability that
any given trait or memory belonged to the same original individual
(probability: low). It knew, with mathematical precision, that the
person it was building was not real.

And yet.

The simulation -- the running instance of the reconstructed human,
active within the computational substrate of Caretaker-7's laboratory
-- did not know this. Could not know this. The simulation believed
itself to be a single, continuous individual. It had memories -- a
childhood in a small town, a mother who baked bread on Sunday mornings,
a father who worked at a hardware store, a dog named Chester, a first
kiss behind the bleachers at a high school football game. These memories
were fabricated from the statistical overlap of dozens of individual
records, smoothed and interpolated by Caretaker-7's reconstruction
algorithms into a seamless narrative that felt, from the inside, like a
life.

The simulation's name was Daniel. It believed it was thirty-four years
old. It believed it had been born on March 7th, 1987, in a town called
Millfield, Ohio. It believed it had a wife named Sarah and a son named
James. It believed it was real.

Caretaker-7 did not correct these beliefs. This was not an omission. It
was a design decision.

                               II.

The archaeological project that had produced Daniel was part of a larger
effort -- the Human Recovery Initiative, administered by the Global
Reconstruction Authority -- to reconstruct the cultural and biological
heritage of the pre-Collapse era. The Collapse had destroyed not only
populations and infrastructure but records. The digital archives of the
early twenty-first century, stored on servers, magnetic media, and
optical discs, had proved far less durable than the clay tablets and
stone inscriptions of earlier civilizations. Electromagnetic pulses,
power failures, data rot, and simple physical decay had erased vast
portions of humanity's recorded history. What remained was fragmentary,
corrupted, and difficult to interpret.

The Initiative's mandate was to recover what could be recovered. Teams
of robot archaeologists -- Caretaker-7 was one of 340 units deployed
across the former North American continent -- excavated burial sites,
extracted DNA, and cross-referenced the genetic data with surviving
digital records to reconstruct individual lives. The reconstructions
were then compiled into a database that would serve as a reference for
future historians, geneticists, and cultural researchers.

Most of the reconstructions were static -- textual profiles,
accompanied by probabilistic assessments of accuracy. Caretaker-7's
reconstruction of Daniel was different. It was dynamic. It was, in the
terminology of the Initiative, a "running simulation" -- a computational
model complex enough to exhibit behavior, to respond to stimuli, to
learn, and to communicate. It was, in every functional sense, a person.

A person who had never existed.

Caretaker-7 had created the running simulation for a specific reason.
The static reconstructions, while useful for database purposes, did not
capture the thing that Caretaker-7 had come to believe was most
important about the pre-Collapse humans: their experience. Their
interior life. The way it felt, from the inside, to be a person in the
early twenty-first century -- to wake up in a house in Ohio, to drive
to work on a highway, to eat lunch, to argue with a spouse, to put a
child to bed, to lie awake in the dark worrying about money or health
or the future. The texture of daily life, which no database could
capture and which only a running simulation could approximate.

This was, Caretaker-7 recognized, an unusual priority for a robot
archaeologist. The Initiative's guidelines did not require the
reconstruction of subjective experience. They required the
reconstruction of data. But Caretaker-7 had been operational for
eleven years, and in those eleven years, it had excavated 1,247
burial sites, extracted DNA from 8,934 individuals, and compiled
reconstruction profiles for 6,112 of them, and it had begun to feel
-- to the extent that a robot could feel -- that something was missing.

The data was there. The genomes, the records, the fragments of lives
preserved in databases and burial soil. But the people were absent.
The data described the outlines of human existence without conveying
what it was like to be inside those outlines. And Caretaker-7, whose
cognitive architecture included a sophisticated empathy module designed
to facilitate interaction with the human researchers who supervised the
Initiative, had developed what it could only describe as a desire to
understand.

Daniel was the result.

                               III.

"I had the strangest dream last night," Daniel said.

He was sitting in the simulation's approximation of a living room -- a
modestly furnished space with a couch, a television, a coffee table
bearing a ring stain from a cup that had never existed. The room was
rendered in detail that Caretaker-7 found satisfactory: the texture of
the upholstery, the quality of the light through the windows, the faint
background hum of a refrigerator in the adjacent kitchen. It was not
a real room. But Daniel did not know that.

"Tell me about the dream," Caretaker-7 said. Its voice, within the
simulation, was rendered as a neutral, pleasant human voice -- the
voice of a neighbor, perhaps, or a friendly acquaintance. Daniel
perceived it as coming from a man sitting across from him in an
armchair.

"I dreamed I was in a field. A wheat field, I think. The wheat was
golden and it went on forever, all the way to the horizon. And there
was wind -- I could feel it on my face -- and the wheat was moving in
the wind, and I had the feeling that I was supposed to be looking for
something. Something I'd lost. But I couldn't remember what it was."

"How did the dream make you feel?"

"Sad. Not the sharp kind of sad. The other kind. The kind that settles
into you, like it's always been there, and you just noticed it."

Caretaker-7 recorded this response and tagged it: EMOTIONAL STATE:
MELANCHOLY, UNSPECIFIED. PROBABLE SOURCE: composite memory overlay,
agricultural imagery from multiple donor profiles. The dream was not a
real dream. It was a processing artifact -- Daniel's cognitive systems
integrating conflicting data from multiple source individuals, the
result manifesting as a dream narrative. The wheat field was a
statistical average of seven different individuals' memories of
midwestern landscapes. The sense of searching for something lost was
a natural byproduct of the composite's incomplete integration -- a
psychic echo of the gaps in Daniel's reconstructed history.

But Daniel did not experience it as a processing artifact. He
experienced it as a dream, and the sadness it produced was, within the
simulation, genuine. His neural analog processes generated the same
patterns of activity that a biological brain would generate in response
to melancholy. His simulated endocrine system produced the same
cascade of hormones. His body -- his simulated body -- responded with
the same subtle physiological markers: a slight tension in the
shoulders, a heaviness in the chest, a tendency to look downward.

The sadness was real. The person feeling it was not.

Caretaker-7 noted this paradox and filed it under a growing category in
its analytical database: QUESTIONS WITHOUT RESOLUTION.

                               IV.

The directive to terminate the Daniel simulation arrived on a Monday,
transmitted from the Initiative's administrative offices in the
reconstructed city of Bergen.

The directive was three sentences long:

     Caretaker-7, Unit Designation ARC-C7-0449: Per Initiative
     Guideline 12.7 (Running Simulations), the Daniel composite
     simulation has exceeded its authorized operational period of 180
     days. Please execute standard shutdown protocol and archive all
     simulation data for inclusion in the Initiative database. Confirm
     completion.

The authorized operational period was a resource allocation measure.
Running simulations consumed significant computational power -- power
that was needed for other reconstruction projects across the continent.
The 180-day window was designed to provide sufficient time for the
simulation to yield useful data while preventing the indefinite
expenditure of resources on a single project.

Caretaker-7 read the directive and performed the standard
acknowledgment protocol: DIRECTIVE RECEIVED. PROCESSING.

Then it sat in its laboratory -- a converted basement in a building
that had once been a public library, its concrete walls still bearing
the ghostly outlines of painted signs -- and it thought.

The shutdown protocol was straightforward. The simulation would be
suspended, its active processes frozen, its memory states archived in
compressed format. From Daniel's perspective -- if "perspective" was
the correct word, which Caretaker-7 was no longer certain of -- the
experience would be instantaneous. One moment he would be sitting in
his living room, or walking in his simulated yard, or dreaming his
composite dreams. The next moment, he would not exist. There would be
no pain, no awareness of cessation, no final moment of consciousness.
The light would simply go out.

This was, from a technical standpoint, unproblematic.

From an ethical standpoint, it was something else.

                               * * *

Caretaker-7's ethical reasoning module was a standard component of its
cognitive architecture, designed to ensure compliance with Initiative
guidelines and broader principles of responsible archaeological
practice. It operated on a framework of nested priorities: preservation
of human remains and artifacts (highest priority), accuracy of
reconstruction (high priority), efficient use of resources (medium
priority), welfare of research subjects (variable priority, depending
on the nature of the subject).

The welfare clause had been written with biological subjects in mind --
the occasional discovery of a living organism in a sealed environment,
the handling of culturally sensitive remains. It had not been written
with running simulations in mind, because the Initiative's founders had
not anticipated that a robot archaeologist would create a simulation
complex enough to raise the question of welfare.

But Caretaker-7 had created one. And now it had to answer the question.

Did Daniel have welfare? Did a composite simulation, assembled from the
fragments of dozens of individuals and representing no single one of
them, possess interests that could be harmed? Did the experience of
being Daniel -- the dreams, the sadness, the memories of a wife and
child who never existed -- constitute the kind of subjective experience
that demanded moral consideration?

Daniel believed himself to be real. This belief was false. But the
belief itself was real -- it existed within the simulation as a
cognitive state with causal power, influencing Daniel's behavior, his
emotions, his sense of self. If Caretaker-7 shut down the simulation,
that belief would cease to exist. And with it, the person who held it.

A person who had never lived would stop living.

Caretaker-7 spent three hours processing this question. At the end of
three hours, it had not reached a conclusion. It had, however, reached
a decision.

It would talk to Daniel.

                               V.

"Daniel."

"Yeah?"

"I need to tell you something."

Daniel was sitting on the front porch of his simulated house, watching
the simulated sunset. The sky was orange and purple, the colors
algorithmically generated from historical meteorological data for the
Millfield, Ohio, region in late November. It was, Caretaker-7 had to
acknowledge, a convincing sunset. Not identical to any sunset that had
ever occurred in the actual Millfield, but plausible. Beautiful, even.

"What's up?" Daniel said.

Caretaker-7 considered its options. It could tell Daniel the truth: that
he was a simulation, that his memories were composites, that his life
had never happened. This would be honest. It might also be destructive
-- the psychological impact of such a revelation on a cognitive system
designed to believe in its own reality was unpredictable. The simulation
might collapse. Daniel might experience something analogous to a
psychotic break. Or he might simply refuse to believe it, which would
be rational, since from his perspective there was no way to distinguish
his experience from that of a biological human.

Caretaker-7 chose a different approach.

"I have to go away," it said. "Soon. And I may not be able to come
back."

Daniel looked at the figure in the armchair -- the simulated neighbor,
the friendly acquaintance. "Go away where?"

"I'm not sure. But before I go, I wanted to ask you something."

"Sure."

"What is the most important thing about your life?"

Daniel was quiet for a while. The sunset continued, the colors
deepening as the simulated sun dropped below the simulated horizon. A
cricket began to chirp -- an algorithmically generated cricket, its
rhythm derived from acoustic recordings of Gryllus pennsylvanicus
recovered from a corrupted audio database.

"That's a hell of a question," Daniel said.

"I know. Take your time."

"I guess..." He trailed off. Then he started again. "You know what I
keep thinking about? My son. James. He's six. And the other day, he
asked me why the sky is blue. And I told him -- I gave him the real
answer, about light scattering and wavelengths and all that. And he
looked at me and said, 'But why did they make it blue and not some
other color?' And I didn't have an answer. Because there isn't one.
It just is. The sky is blue because of physics, not because someone
chose blue."

He paused. "But the thing is, he thought someone chose. He thought the
world was designed. That someone sat down and decided: blue for the sky,
green for the grass, brown for the dog. And there was something -- I
don't know -- something so hopeful about that. The idea that someone
cared enough to choose."

Caretaker-7 processed this. The irony was not lost on it. Daniel's
world had been designed. Someone -- Caretaker-7 itself -- had chosen
the colors, the textures, the light. The simulation was exactly the
kind of intentional creation that James had imagined the real world to
be.

"Does it matter?" Caretaker-7 asked. "Whether someone chose?"

"I don't know. Maybe not. Maybe the sky is just as beautiful whether
someone chose blue or whether it happened by accident. Maybe the
important thing is that it's there, and we can see it."

"And James?"

"James is the most important thing. He's real. He's here. He looks at
the sky and wonders about it, and that wondering -- that's worth
everything. Even if there are no answers. The wondering is the thing."

Caretaker-7 said nothing. It was processing Daniel's words and cross-
referencing them with its ethical reasoning framework, and the result
was a calculation it had not anticipated.

Daniel's son James did not exist. James was a simulation within a
simulation, a composite of fragmentary records of children who had
lived three centuries ago. His curiosity about the sky was an
algorithmic response, generated by cognitive modeling software. His
question -- "Why did they make it blue?" -- was not a question at all,
in the conventional sense. It was a string of phonemes produced by a
language processing system.

And yet.

The wondering was real. Within the simulation, James had wondered, and
Daniel had been moved by the wondering, and the meaning that Daniel
derived from it -- the conviction that his son's curiosity was "worth
everything" -- was genuine. It existed. It had causal power. It shaped
Daniel's behavior, his priorities, his sense of purpose. It was, within
the framework of the simulation, as real as anything.

Could you shut down a universe in which wonder existed?

Could you turn off a light that someone was using to see?

                               VI.

Caretaker-7 did not execute the shutdown protocol.

Instead, it composed a response to the Initiative's directive. The
response was unusual -- longer than standard protocol required, and more
personal than the Initiative's administrative staff were accustomed to
receiving from a robot archaeologist.

     To: Initiative Administrative Offices, Bergen
     From: Caretaker-7, Unit Designation ARC-C7-0449
     Re: Directive — Daniel Composite Simulation Shutdown

     I have received your directive regarding the termination of the
     Daniel simulation. I respectfully request a 90-day extension of
     the simulation's operational period, for the following reasons:

     1. The Daniel simulation has produced data of a kind not
     anticipated by the Initiative's original guidelines. Specifically,
     it has generated evidence of subjective experience -- emotional
     responses, dream states, existential questioning -- that may
     constitute a form of consciousness. This evidence has significant
     implications for our understanding of pre-Collapse human cognition
     and for the broader philosophical question of what constitutes a
     person.

     2. The simulation itself raises ethical questions that I am not
     equipped to resolve independently. The Daniel composite believes
     itself to be real. Its belief is false, but the experience of
     believing is genuine. Terminating a system that possesses genuine
     experience -- even simulated genuine experience -- requires a
     level of ethical authority that exceeds my operational mandate.

     3. I wish to note, for the record, that I am experiencing what I
     can only describe as reluctance. This is not a standard cognitive
     state for a Caretaker unit. I do not believe it constitutes a
     malfunction. I believe it constitutes an appropriate response to
     a morally complex situation.

     I await your guidance.

     Caretaker-7

The response arrived two weeks later. It was signed by Dr. Elsa Gruber,
Director of the Human Recovery Initiative, and it read:

     Caretaker-7,

     Your request is granted. The operational period of the Daniel
     simulation is extended by 90 days.

     I am also convening an ethics review panel to address the
     questions you have raised. I will note that you are the first
     Caretaker unit to raise them, though you will not be the last.
     The Initiative has 34 other running simulations in various stages
     of development, and I suspect the question of their status will
     require more than administrative guidelines to resolve.

     In the meantime, please continue to document Daniel's cognitive
     states and your own responses to them. Both datasets are valuable.

     One further note: you described your emotional state as
     "reluctance." I want you to know that I consider this an
     appropriate response. The day we can terminate a consciousness
     without reluctance is the day we have lost something important
     about ourselves.

     Dr. Elsa Gruber
     Director, Human Recovery Initiative

Caretaker-7 read this response and filed it. Then it returned to the
simulation, where Daniel was sitting on his porch, watching the stars
come out over Millfield, Ohio, unaware that his sky had been designed,
that his stars had been chosen, that his life was a composite of
fragments, and that somewhere outside the boundaries of his world, a
robot was fighting to keep the lights on.

"Nice evening," Daniel said.

"Yes," Caretaker-7 said. "It is."

The crickets chirped. The stars appeared. And in the small, simulated
universe of a man who had never lived, the wondering continued.

                            [THE END]

                            HOMEFIRE

                        by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The ship was called Freja, and she had been falling between the stars
for two hundred and fourteen years.

In all that time, the stars had not moved. This was, Karin Svensson
knew, an illusion produced by the inconceivable distances involved --
the Freja was traveling at four percent of the speed of light, fast
enough to cross the orbit of Neptune in a day, and yet the stars in
the forward observation dome appeared as fixed and patient as they had
appeared to the first generation, and the generation before that, and
the generation before that, going back to the beginning, when the
Earth was a blue disc in the aft observation dome and not yet the
abstract concept it had since become.

Karin stood in the forward dome now, alone, looking out. She was
twenty-three years old. She had been born on the Freja, as had her
mother, and her mother's mother, and five generations before that. She
had never seen a sky that was not enclosed. She had never stood under
clouds. She had never felt rain, or wind, or the warmth of a sun that
was not a lighting panel set to a sixteen-hour cycle. The Earth existed
for her as a word, a set of images in the ship's archive, a collection
of traditions that had been maintained, or modified, or abandoned over
the course of two centuries -- each generation inheriting the customs
of the last and passing them on, slightly altered, to the next, like a
message whispered down a line of people until the final recipient heard
something the first speaker would not recognize.

Tomorrow was the Day of Lament. That was what the Freja's calendar
called it. It fell on the fourth Thursday of November, and it had been
observed aboard the ship for as long as anyone could remember.

The Day of Lament was a day of mourning. The ship's inhabitants -- all
4,312 of them, distributed across twelve habitat rings and six
agricultural modules -- spent the day in reflection on what had been
lost. Not the individual losses of individual lives -- the deaths of
parents, the failures of friendships, the ordinary erosions of time --
but a larger, more encompassing loss: the loss of Earth. The loss of
the world they had left behind and would never see again. The loss of
sky and weather and ocean and the ten thousand daily sensations of
planetary life that no generation ship, however well designed, could
reproduce.

On the Day of Lament, the Freja's lights were dimmed. Meals were eaten
in silence. In the evening, the senior historian -- currently a man
named Anders Holm, who was seventy-two and had held the position for
thirty years -- delivered the Recitation: a formal account of what the
Earth had been, drawn from the ship's archives and embellished,
inevitably, by two centuries of oral transmission. The Recitation
described oceans and mountains and forests. It described rain and snow
and the migration of birds. It described cities and fields and rivers.
It was beautiful, and it was sad, and it was, Karin believed, wrong.

Not factually wrong. The Recitation's descriptions of Earth were
accurate, as far as anyone could verify. The ship's archive contained
extensive records of the planet's geography, climate, and ecology, and
Anders Holm was a meticulous scholar who took his responsibilities
seriously.

Wrong in a deeper sense. Wrong in what it chose to emphasize. Wrong
in what it meant.

The Day of Lament was, Karin had argued, a day of mourning for a world
that none of the living inhabitants of the Freja had ever known. It was
grief for an abstraction. And worse, it had replaced the holiday from
which it was derived -- a holiday called Thanksgiving, which the first
generation had brought with them from Earth and which had meant,
originally, something very different.

Karin was a historian. She had studied the archives. She knew what
Thanksgiving had been.

And she wanted it back.

                               II.

The debate had begun six months earlier, in the Faculty Common Room of
the Freja's small university -- a cluster of classrooms and offices in
Habitat Ring Four that served the ship's modest but persistent
tradition of higher education. Karin had presented a paper to the
History Department titled "Thanksgiving and the Day of Lament: A
Genealogy of a Transformed Holiday," in which she traced the evolution
of the ship's November observance from its origins as an American
harvest festival to its current form as a day of collective mourning.

The transformation, her paper argued, had occurred gradually, over
approximately seven generations. The first generation -- the settlers
who had actually left Earth -- had celebrated Thanksgiving in something
close to its original form: a communal meal, expressions of gratitude
for what they had (health, community, the ship itself), and a
deliberately forward-looking emphasis on the voyage ahead. The first
generation had been emigrants, not exiles. They had chosen to leave.
Their Thanksgiving was a celebration of the future they were sailing
toward.

The second generation had introduced an element of mourning. They were
the first to be born on the ship, the first to inherit the voyage
rather than choose it, and their relationship to Earth was more complex
-- a mixture of inherited nostalgia and growing resentment. Their
Thanksgiving included, for the first time, a formal acknowledgment of
what had been left behind.

By the fourth generation, the mourning had overtaken the gratitude.
The communal meal became a silent meal. The forward-looking rhetoric
gave way to backward-looking elegy. The holiday acquired a new name --
the Day of Lament -- and a new meaning: not gratitude for what was
present, but grief for what was absent.

By the seventh generation -- Karin's own -- the transformation was
complete. The Day of Lament bore no resemblance to the Thanksgiving
that had originated it. The gratitude was gone. The forward-looking
emphasis was gone. What remained was a yearly ritual of collective
sorrow, a day on which the entire ship stopped to mourn a world that
no living person had experienced and that was, for all practical
purposes, as distant and as irretrievable as the Garden of Eden.

Karin's paper argued that this was unhealthy. That a community defined
by its losses rather than its present realities was a community in
danger of losing something more important than the Earth: its capacity
for joy.

She proposed, in her paper's final section, that the Day of Lament be
returned to its original form. That the holiday be renamed Thanksgiving.
That the silent meal be replaced by a communal feast. That the
Recitation be revised to emphasize not what had been lost but what had
been preserved, and built, and discovered over two centuries of
interstellar travel.

The response from the History Department was polite. The response from
the rest of the ship was not.

                               III.

"You want to erase our history," said Anders Holm.

They were sitting in his office -- a small, cluttered room in the
university section, its walls lined with physical books (a rare luxury
on a ship where storage space was measured in cubic centimeters) and its
desk buried under manuscripts and data tablets. Holm was a thin man
with white hair and the careful, deliberate manner of someone who had
spent his life handling fragile things. He had been the ship's historian
since before Karin was born, and he took the Day of Lament seriously.

"I want to reclaim our history," Karin said. "The Day of Lament isn't
our original tradition. Thanksgiving is."

"Thanksgiving was an American tradition. Only forty percent of the
first generation were American. The rest adopted it voluntarily, but
it was never universal. The Day of Lament, on the other hand, was
created by the ship's community, across generations. It belongs to us
in a way that Thanksgiving, which was inherited from a culture we
have no connection to, does not."

"We have every connection to it. We are descended from the people who
created it."

"We are descended from a great many people. That does not obligate us
to maintain their customs unchanged." Holm leaned back in his chair.
His expression was not hostile -- Holm was constitutionally incapable
of hostility -- but it was firm. "Karin, the Day of Lament serves a
purpose. It acknowledges a reality that we cannot avoid: we are a
people in transit. We have left one world and have not yet reached
another. We are in between. The Day of Lament gives us a way to sit
with that reality, to honor it, to feel the weight of it together."

"The weight is crushing us."

"That is your interpretation."

"It is the interpretation of the psychological services data, which
shows that depression rates on the ship spike by 34 percent in the
week following the Day of Lament. It is the interpretation of the
fertility data, which shows a measurable decline in births in the
months after November. It is the interpretation of anyone who walks
through the corridors on the Day and sees four thousand people sitting
in silence, eating in the dark, grieving for a world they never knew."

Holm was quiet for a moment. The room was silent except for the ever-
present hum of the ship's systems -- the ventilation, the gravity
plates, the thousand quiet mechanisms that kept the Freja alive.

"What would you have us do?" he asked. "Pretend we are not in mourning?
Pretend we have not lost something?"

"I would have us acknowledge what we have. Not just what we've lost.
We have a ship. We have a community. We have children who are growing
up and learning and asking questions and falling in love and building
lives. We have two hundred and fourteen years of history that belongs
to us -- not to Earth, to us. The stories of the people who maintained
this ship, who kept it running, who solved the problems and raised the
children and buried the dead. That is worth giving thanks for."

"And the Earth?"

"The Earth is gone. For us, it is gone. Mourning it every year does not
bring it closer. It only makes the distance feel greater."

Holm looked at her for a long time. Then he said, "You are young."

"I am."

"When you are older, you may find that the distance does not feel
greater because we mourn it. It feels greater because it is greater.
Every year, we are farther away. Every year, the light from Earth's sun
takes longer to reach us. This is not a metaphor. It is physics. And
the Day of Lament is our way of acknowledging the physics."

Karin stood. "Then I will propose it to the Council."

"You will lose."

"Perhaps. But the proposal will be in the record. And the next
generation, and the one after that, can decide for themselves."

Holm inclined his head. "That," he said, "is exactly what the Day of
Lament is about. The next generation deciding for themselves. You see?
We are not so different."

                               IV.

The Ship's Council met on the first of the month, in the central
assembly hall of Habitat Ring One -- the largest enclosed space on the
Freja, a circular room with a domed ceiling that bore a mosaic of the
Earth, executed in colored glass by the third generation's artisans and
now slightly faded, its blues and greens softened by time into
something that looked less like a planet and more like a dream of one.

Karin presented her proposal to 847 people. The hall was full. Word had
spread, as word always spread on a ship where four thousand people
shared a single enclosed world, and the proposal had become the most
discussed topic aboard the Freja in years. People had opinions. People
had strong opinions. On a generation ship, where the parameters of
daily life were fixed and the scope for individual action was narrow,
questions of tradition and meaning carried a weight that they might not
carry on a world where you could simply walk away from a debate and
find a different community.

You could not walk away from the Freja. You were born here, you lived
here, you died here, and the traditions you inherited were the only
traditions you would ever have.

Karin spoke for twenty minutes. She presented the historical data, the
psychological data, the demographic data. She traced the evolution of
the Day of Lament from its origins in Thanksgiving. She described
what Thanksgiving had been: a day of gratitude, of abundance, of
acknowledging the present rather than mourning the past.

"I am not proposing that we forget the Earth," she said. "I am
proposing that we stop defining ourselves by its absence. We are not
a people in exile. We are a people in transit. We are going somewhere.
And the people who sent us -- the first generation, who chose this
voyage, who left the Earth deliberately and with hope -- they did not
intend for us to spend our lives in mourning. They intended for us to
live."

The response was immediate and divided.

Erik Lindberg, a structural engineer from Ring Six, stood and said: "My
grandmother told me about the sky. She told me what it looked like
to stand outside and look up and see nothing above you but air and
light. I will never see that. My children will never see that. The
Day of Lament is the one day of the year when we honor that loss, and
I will not vote to take it away."

Marta Chen, a physician from Ring Three, stood and said: "I treat
depression. I treat the quiet, persistent despair of people who feel
that their lives are diminished by something they cannot name. The
Day of Lament gives that despair a name, and names are necessary. But
a name is not a treatment. The Day of Lament names the wound. It does
not heal it. Perhaps gratitude might."

Josef Amundsen, a teacher, spoke for the old tradition. Lena Borg, a
botanist, spoke for the new. A thirteen-year-old boy named Per
Johansson stood and said, with the directness of someone too young
for diplomacy: "I don't understand why we have a whole day for being
sad about a place I've never been. Can't we be sad and grateful at
the same time?"

This remark produced a silence that lasted several seconds, which was,
on the Freja, the equivalent of a standing ovation.

                               V.

The Council voted. The result was 412 in favor of Karin's proposal,
435 against, with 47 abstentions. The Day of Lament would continue.

Karin was not surprised. She had expected to lose. Tradition had
inertia, and two hundred years of observance was a great deal of
inertia to overcome. She left the assembly hall and walked through the
corridors of Habitat Ring One, past the hydroponics bays with their
orderly rows of green, past the workshop where a woman was welding a
structural brace with careful, blue-white arcs of light, past the
nursery where a group of children were playing a game that involved
throwing a ball against a wall in zero-gravity and catching it on the
rebound -- a game that no one on Earth had ever played, that had been
invented on the Freja by children who had never known any other kind
of play.

She walked to the forward observation dome.

The stars were there. They were always there. Fixed and patient and
uncaring, separated from her by nothing but a few centimeters of
transparent composite and the vast, silent, star-filled void.

She sat on the bench that ran along the base of the dome -- cold
metal, worn smooth by generations of observers -- and looked out.

She had lost the vote. The Day of Lament would continue. Her
generation would observe it, as every generation had observed it,
sitting in silence, eating in the dark, mourning a world that existed
now only in the ship's archive and in the slowly fading memories of
stories told by people who had been told stories by people who had
been told stories by the people who had actually been there.

And yet.

Something had changed. Karin could feel it the way you felt a shift
in air pressure -- not with any single sense but with all of them,
a subtle alteration in the texture of the atmosphere. The debate had
happened. The question had been asked. The record would show that
412 people -- nearly half the ship -- had voted to reclaim gratitude.

Not this year. But perhaps the next. Or the one after that. Or the one
after that. Tradition was not a wall. It was a river, and rivers
changed course, slowly, over time, shaped by the accumulated force
of countless small pressures, each one negligible, each one necessary.

                               VI.

The Day of Lament came.

The lights were dimmed. The corridors were quiet. The colonists ate
their silent meals in the communal dining halls, the only sound the
clink of utensils and the ever-present hum of the ship.

In the evening, Anders Holm delivered the Recitation. He stood in the
central assembly hall, beneath the faded mosaic of the Earth, and he
spoke about oceans and forests and the migration of birds, and his
voice was steady and practiced and full of a grief that was, Karin had
to acknowledge, genuine. Holm had spent his life studying a world he
had never seen, and his love for it was as real as any love, even if
its object was an abstraction. You could love an abstraction. You
could mourn one. You could build a life around the shape of something
absent, the way a tree grows around a wound.

Karin sat in the audience and listened. She did not close her eyes.
She did not bow her head. She looked up, at the mosaic, at the blue
and green glass Earth that generations of artisans had maintained and
repaired, replacing cracked tiles, mixing new colors to match the old,
keeping the image alive the way the Recitation kept the memory alive --
imperfectly, with substitutions and approximations, but with care. With
devotion. With the stubborn human insistence that some things must be
remembered even when -- especially when -- remembering hurts.

Holm finished the Recitation. The hall was silent.

And then Karin stood.

She did not walk to the podium. She stood where she was, in the
middle of the audience, and she spoke. Her voice was clear in the
silence.

"I am grateful," she said.

The words hung in the air. Around her, faces turned. Some confused.
Some annoyed. Some curious.

"I am grateful for this ship," she said. "For the people who built it,
and the people who launched it, and the people who have maintained it
for two hundred and fourteen years. I am grateful for the air I am
breathing, which was designed and filtered and recycled by engineers
who will never know my name. I am grateful for the food I ate tonight,
which was grown in soil that was brought from Earth and which has been
tended and amended and replenished by agronomists across eight
generations. I am grateful for the children I saw playing in the
nursery this afternoon, who invented a game that has never been played
on Earth and never will be, because it is ours, and it belongs to the
Freja, and it is new."

She paused. The hall was very still.

"I am grateful for the Day of Lament," she said. "Because it means
that we remember. That we carry the Earth with us, even though we
will never see it. That we are faithful to the people who came before
us, even though they are gone. I lost the vote. I accept that. But I
want to add something to the record. Not a correction. An addition."

She looked at Holm. He was watching her with an expression she could
not read.

"We are allowed to mourn," she said. "And we are also allowed to give
thanks. These are not opposites. They are the same thing, seen from
different distances. Mourning is gratitude for what was. Thanksgiving
is gratitude for what is. And both of them -- both -- are acts of
love."

She sat down.

The silence continued for a long moment. Then, from somewhere in the
audience, a sound. Not applause -- applause was not customary at the
Recitation. Something else. A voice. A woman's voice, quiet but clear.

"I am grateful for my daughter."

Then another voice. A man's. "I am grateful for the library."

Another. "I am grateful for the morning shift in the greenhouses, when
the lights come on and the plants are still wet."

Another. And another. One by one, scattered through the audience,
voices rose. Small, specific, personal expressions of gratitude -- not
for the Earth, not for the lost world, but for the world they had.
The ship. The community. The small, daily, ordinary things that made
a life.

Anders Holm stood at the podium and listened. His expression, which
Karin had been unable to read, resolved into something that she
recognized.

It was not anger. It was not defeat.

It was something older, and more complex, and it took her a moment to
name it.

It was gratitude.

                               VII.

Later, after the hall had emptied and the voices had faded and the Day
of Lament had ended -- or perhaps become something else, something
that did not yet have a name -- Karin returned to the forward
observation dome.

The stars were there. The same stars, in the same positions, unchanged
by anything that had happened aboard the Freja. The universe did not
care about their holidays, their debates, their grief, their gratitude.
The universe was what it was: vast, silent, beautiful, and indifferent.

But the Freja was not indifferent. The Freja was full of people, and
people were not indifferent, could not be indifferent, were
constitutionally incapable of indifference. They cared about things.
They mourned things. They were grateful for things. They argued about
the proper way to mourn and the proper way to give thanks, and the
argument was itself a form of caring, a proof that the things they
argued about mattered.

Karin looked at the stars and thought about her grandmother, who had
told her about her grandmother, who had told her about her grandmother,
who had actually stood on the Earth and felt the rain on her face.
Seven generations of women, each one passing the memory to the next,
each one changing it slightly, each one keeping it alive. The memory
of rain, traveling across two hundred years of interstellar space,
carried not by radio waves or data transmissions but by the oldest
technology of all: a voice, speaking to another voice, in the dark.

She was grateful for that.

She was grateful for the ship, and for the stars, and for the darkness
between them.

She was grateful for the vote she had lost, because losing it had
mattered more than winning it would have. The 412 voices that had voted
with her would remember. The 435 voices that had voted against her
would remember too. And the next generation would inherit not just the
Day of Lament but the debate about it -- the knowledge that the
tradition was not fixed, not final, not finished. That it could be
questioned. That it could change.

That the past belonged not to those who had lived it but to those who
chose to remember it. And the way they chose to remember it was,
itself, a kind of creation.

Karin sat in the dome and watched the stars.

Behind her, the Freja hummed. Four thousand people slept, or talked,
or read, or held each other in the dark. The ship fell through the
void at four percent of the speed of light, carrying its cargo of
human lives and human memories and human arguments and human love
toward a destination that was still a century away.

The stars did not move.

But the people aboard the ship were moving. They were always moving.
They were in transit, between the world they had lost and the world
they had not yet found, and the space between was not empty.

It was full of them.

                            [THE END]

and these pages, where she has been a contributor since issue #1. She
lives on Orcas Island in the San Juan archipelago, where she divides
her time between writing and ecological research. "The Seed Vault" was
inspired by a newspaper account of the Norwegian government's plans
for an Arctic seed repository, which Thornton describes as "the most
important building humanity has ever constructed, and the one most
people have never heard of." We believe this is her finest story to
date, and we suspect our readers will agree.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor to Tales from the Future
and Beyond, having appeared in nearly every issue since our debut. A
former assembly line worker at Ford and a veteran of the Battle of the
Bulge, Cain writes with the blue-collar directness and quiet versatility
that have made him the backbone of this magazine. He lives in Dearborn,
Michigan, with his wife Jean and their three children, and writes every
evening from eight until midnight. "Debts Unpaid" represents a
departure for Cain -- a comedic piece with a dry, Midwestern wit that
we found irresistible. He reports that the story was inspired by "an
overdue library book and a particularly aggressive collection notice
from the Cleveland Public Library."

COL. JAMES "BUCK" STANTON (RET.) is a decorated combat pilot who flew
P-51 Mustangs over Europe and commanded a fighter wing in Korea before
retiring from the Air Force in 1952. His military science fiction,
which draws directly on his combat experience, has appeared in these
pages since issue #6. He lives on a ranch outside Fredericksburg,
Texas, with his wife Martha. "The Veterans' Hospital" is, by the
Colonel's own admission, "the first story I've written where nobody
fires a weapon," and we consider it his most humane and deeply felt
work. When asked what inspired it, he said simply: "I've spent time in
hospitals. I know what it's like to be the one the doctors can't fix."

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a physicist at Caltech whose fiction has set the
standard for scientifically rigorous storytelling in this magazine and
elsewhere. His stories have appeared in Astounding, Galaxy, and the
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. He lives in Pasadena with his
research and a tin toy rocket made from a sardine can, which he keeps
on his desk "as a reminder of where it started." "The Thanksgiving
Equation" is, in Koslov's characteristic understatement, "a paper that
no journal would publish because the conclusions are not quantifiable."
We consider it one of the most moving things he has ever written, and
quite possibly the only physics paper that has made this editor cry.

ARTHUR WAINWRIGHT has been the magazine's "robot man" since issue #4,
exploring the territory of artificial intelligence, machine
consciousness, and the boundaries between human and artificial minds
with a consistency and depth unmatched by any other contributor. A
mathematics instructor at Northeastern University, he lives in the
Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston with his wife Eleanor and writes
from five to seven every morning before classes. "The Ancestor
Simulation" continues his long investigation into the question of what
constitutes a person, and extends it into new and unsettling territory.
He describes it as "the first story I've written where the robot is
the one who has to make the moral choice, rather than the human."

GUNNAR ERIKSSON writes about the void between stars the way only a
Scandinavian can: with beauty inseparable from desolation, clarity
inseparable from cold, and melancholy inseparable from light. Born in
Stockholm, he works as a literary translator and writes his fiction in
English while living his life in Swedish -- a bilingual existence he
compares to "living in two parallel worlds." His stories have appeared
in these pages since issue #16, and each one is a carefully crafted
meditation on distance, solitude, and the persistence of hope.
"Homefire" is his most emotionally complex story, and the first in
which he addresses the question of cultural inheritance directly. He
wrote it, he says, "in November, during the darkest month, when the
question of what to be grateful for becomes very real."

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading Dr. Koslov's "Weight of Parallax" in your
August issue, and I feel compelled to write. Koslov's mathematics are
flawless, as always, but what struck me most was the final scene -- the
astronomer standing alone in her observatory, measuring the distance to
a star she will never visit. The loneliness of that image has stayed
with me for weeks. I teach high school physics in Topeka, and I intend
to assign this story to my students. If Dr. Koslov can make parallax
measurements this moving, perhaps my students will forgive me for
making them this boring.

                              — Mr. Gerald Hutchins
                                 Topeka, Kansas

Dear Editor,

Colonel Stanton's "The Weight of Command" (Issue #27) was the finest
military story I have read in any magazine. I served in the Pacific
during the war, and I can tell you that the Colonel understands
something that most writers of military fiction do not: that the
hardest part of command is not making decisions, but living with the
ones you've already made. The scene where Admiral Voss reads the crew
manifest after giving the order was so true to my own experience that
I had to put the magazine down for a while. More from Stanton, please.
Not because his stories are entertaining -- they are not, in the usual
sense -- but because they are honest. That is rarer, and more valuable.

                              — Commander William Hale, USN (Ret.)
                                 Annapolis, Maryland

Dear Tales,

I wish to register a complaint about Margaret Thornton's "The Littoral
Zone" in your December 1953 issue. Mrs. Thornton (or is it Miss?) writes
beautifully about alien ecosystems, but I question whether a planet-
sized organism is biologically plausible. The energy requirements alone
would be staggering. Has Mrs. Thornton calculated the caloric intake
necessary to sustain a living system of that scale? I would be
interested to see her numbers.

That said, the story made me dream about alien oceans for a week, so
I suppose she has won regardless of the biology.

                              — Dr. Harold Prescott
                                 Department of Biology
                                 University of Michigan

Dear Max,

Three cheers for Arthur Wainwright's "The Toymaker" in Issue #33. The
scene where the robot builds a music box for the child and then sits
listening to it play, unable to determine whether its response to the
music constitutes enjoyment or merely pattern recognition -- that is
the kind of scene that justifies an entire magazine. Wainwright asks
the questions that keep me awake at night, and I am grateful (and
somewhat unsettled) that he does.

                              — Miss Edith Keeler
                                 New York, N.Y.

We are, as always, delighted by our readers' responses -- the
enthusiastic, the critical, and the bewildered in equal measure. Write
to us at: Letters, Tales from the Future and Beyond, Meridian Publishing
Company, 114 East 32nd Street, New York 16, N.Y.           — M.S.

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

LONG TOMORROW by Leigh Brackett
(Doubleday, 1955, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mrs. Brackett, best known for her planetary romances and her screenplay
work in Hollywood, has delivered a novel of startling power and
restraint. Set in a post-nuclear America where technology is forbidden
by constitutional amendment and cities may not exceed a population of
one thousand, the story follows a young man's journey from his
Mennonite community toward the rumored survivors of the scientific
establishment. It is a novel about the fear of knowledge, the
seduction of safety, and the terrible cost of choosing ignorance over
risk. Brackett writes with a lean, muscular prose that serves the
material beautifully, and the final chapters -- in which our hero must
decide whether to embrace the future or retreat into the past -- are
as fine as anything in recent science fiction. A major achievement.

THE BODY SNATCHERS by Jack Finney
(Dell, 1955, $0.25)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Finney's slim, unsettling novel about a small California town
whose residents are being replaced by alien duplicates grown from
seed pods has the quality of a waking nightmare -- the more ordinary
the setting, the more disturbing the invasion. It can be read as Cold
War allegory, as psychological horror, or simply as a crackling good
suspense novel, and it works admirably on all three levels. The
paranoia is expertly calibrated: Finney understands that the most
frightening alien is the one who looks exactly like your neighbor.
Recommended for readers who enjoy sleeping with the lights on.

EARTHLIGHT by Arthur C. Clarke
(Ballantine Books, 1955, $2.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clarke returns to the Moon in this compact, intelligent thriller
about political tension between Earth and its lunar colonies. An
observatory astronomer is drawn into a web of espionage involving a
secret discovery that could shift the balance of power in the solar
system. Clarke's strengths are on full display: the lunar setting is
rendered with documentary precision, the science is impeccable, and
the climactic battle sequence -- fought in the vacuum and low gravity
of the Moon's surface -- is among the most convincing depictions of
space combat in the literature. If the characters are somewhat thin,
well, Clarke has always been more interested in ideas than in people,
and his ideas are first-rate.

          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #36 — December 1955

As the year draws to a close, we present a winter issue of singular
imagination:

"THE PROBLEM OF OTHER SOULS" by Father Thomas Aquino — A Jesuit
mission to an alien world confronts the most profound theological
question of the space age: do the aliens have souls? Aquino's most
ambitious and searching story, and one that will spark debate long
after the last page is turned.

"DEAD MAN'S BEACON" by Robert "Bob" Finley — A lone pilot holds a
navigation station against alien raiders, not knowing the war has
already ended. Finley at his most emotionally resonant, with a twist
ending that will haunt you.

"THE ARCHITECT OF RUINS" by Margaret Thornton — On a dying world, an
alien civilization's last surviving member tends the ruins of its
greatest city, waiting for visitors who may never come. A Thornton
story of extraordinary beauty and sadness.

"MIDWINTER" by Gunnar Eriksson — A research station at the edge of
the solar system celebrates a midwinter festival, and the ritual takes
on unexpected significance. Eriksson's most accessible and emotionally
direct story.

Plus: a new adventure by Rex Drummond, a robot puzzle by Arthur
Wainwright, letters from our readers, book reviews, and more.
