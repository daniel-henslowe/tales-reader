TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

There is a phrase that the old cartographers used to write in the blank
spaces at the margins of their maps. You know the one: Here be dragons.

It is easy, from our modern vantage, to smile at such quaint notation.
We have mapped the globe to the last atoll. We have photographed the
dark side of the Moon. We have measured the distance to Andromeda and
calculated the temperature of the sun's corona to several decimal places.
The blank spaces, it would seem, are filled.

But of course they are not. The blank spaces have merely moved. They are
no longer at the edges of the Atlantic or the interior of Africa; they
are at the rim of the solar system, the boundary of the observable
universe, the unexplored frequencies of the electromagnetic spectrum,
the limits of what our instruments can detect and our minds can
comprehend. The map has grown larger, and its margins have grown with it.
There are more dragons now than ever.

This issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond is about those margins.
We have titled it "The Edges of the Map," and every story in these pages
concerns itself with boundaries — the boundary between charted space and
the void, between the known and the unknowable, between the familiar
universe and whatever lies beyond it.

Gunnar Eriksson opens with a story that turns the void itself into a
subject worthy of study — and of love. Theodore Cain mans a customs
desk at the very edge of human space and reminds us that bureaucracy
will follow us to the stars. Cordell Beaumont ventures into the last
unmapped continent of an alien world and finds something magnificent
and terrible waiting. Bob Finley gives us a frontier surgeon with steady
hands and a patient whose very biology is being rewritten. Lucian Marsh
listens to frequencies that no receiver should be able to hear and hears
a message from before the beginning of time. And Father Thomas Aquino
takes us to a monastery at the edge of the observable universe, where
the cosmic microwave background is visible as a wall of fading light,
and asks what it means to stand at the boundary of everything.

Six stories. Six edges. Here be dragons — and wonder, and terror, and
the stubborn human compulsion to walk toward the unknown rather than
away from it.

I am proud of every page.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                         ATLAS OF EMPTINESS

                        by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The generation ship Fröja had been traveling for one hundred and
forty-seven years when it entered the Lacuna.

Elin Dahl learned of the transition from a single line in the morning
navigational bulletin, printed on the thin yellow paper that the
bulletin office recycled from discarded cargo manifests. She read it
at her station in the observatory dome, holding the sheet in one hand
and a cup of bitter chicory substitute in the other. The bulletin
stated: "Ship's position as of 0600 hours, Year 147, Day 91: The Fröja
has entered the region designated Navigational Void LC-7, colloquially
known as the Lacuna. Duration of transit: estimated fourteen years.
Stellar density in LC-7: zero measurable objects per cubic parsec."

Zero measurable objects per cubic parsec.

Elin set the bulletin down on the console and looked through the
observation port. The port was a circle of treated glass two meters in
diameter, the largest clear aperture on the ship, reserved for the use
of the astronomy section. For one hundred and forty-seven years, that
port had framed stars — sometimes many, sometimes few, but always
something. A dim red dwarf. A field of distant points. The faint
luminous haze of a nebula's edge.

Now it framed nothing.

Not darkness — Elin would have accepted darkness. Darkness was a thing,
a presence, a condition with its own character. What she saw through the
port was absence. The glass might as well have been painted over. The
void was total, uniform, and without variation. It was as though the
universe had run out of material and left this place unfinished.

She stared at it for a long time. Somewhere behind her, in the deeper
chambers of the observatory dome, she could hear Henrik Strand powering
down the spectrographic array. There was nothing for it to measure.

                               * * *

The Fröja was home to four thousand, two hundred and eleven people.

It had been built in Earth orbit in the year 2089 — the third of the
great colony ships, bound for the Tau Ceti system, where a survey probe
had identified two planets in the habitable zone. The ship was a
cylinder six kilometers long and one and a half kilometers in diameter,
rotating on its long axis to produce a simulation of gravity that was,
after a hundred and forty-seven years of gradual bearing degradation,
approximately 0.87 of Earth standard. Its interior was divided into
twelve decks, each with its own atmosphere, lighting cycle, and
functional purpose: agricultural decks, residential decks, industrial
decks, a medical deck, a school deck, and, at the forward end, the
observatory dome.

Elin Dahl had been born on Deck Seven, the second residential level,
thirty-one years ago. She had never seen Earth, nor any planet. She had
never stood beneath an open sky. She had never felt wind, or rain, or
the warmth of a sun on her skin. These were abstractions to her — words
in books, images in the ship's archive, concepts as remote as the
historical accounts of oceans and forests that the education department
taught to children in the lower school.

What was not abstract to her were stars.

She had begun studying them at age nine, when her mother — a structural
engineer on Deck Four — had taken her to the observatory dome for the
first time and she had pressed her face against the observation port and
seen the stars not as points on a chart or images on a screen but as
real things, real light, traveling real distances across real space to
arrive at the precise location where her eyes could receive it. The
experience had been, in the quiet and private vocabulary that Elin used
for things that mattered, a revelation. The ship was small. The universe
was not. And between the ship and the universe there was a relationship
that could be studied, measured, and — she felt this with the certainty
of a child who has discovered her vocation — understood.

She had trained as an astronomer. There were not many astronomers on the
Fröja — the discipline was considered a luxury, a holdover from Earth
culture that the ship's resource allocation committee funded reluctantly
and reviewed skeptically at each annual budget cycle. The observatory
had a staff of three: Elin, Henrik Strand (who was fifty-seven and had
the permanent stoop of a man who had spent decades bending over
instruments designed for shorter people), and a part-time technician
named Rúna Sigurdsdottir, who was primarily a communications officer
and treated the observatory as a secondary posting.

Three people to study a universe. It had always struck Elin as
insufficient. Now, staring into the void of the Lacuna, it struck her
as absurd.

                               II.

The first week in the Lacuna was disorienting.

Elin had not anticipated the psychological effect of the void on the
ship's population. The Fröja's interior was self-contained — most
people spent their lives on the residential and agricultural decks,
surrounded by corridor walls and hydroponic greenery and the familiar
rhythms of shipboard routine. They never looked through the observation
ports. The stars, for them, were a fact of navigation, not of daily
experience.

But they knew the stars were there. They knew it the way a person in a
windowless room knows that the world exists outside the walls — not
through direct perception, but through a deeper, almost animal
awareness. The stars were context. The stars were backdrop. The stars
were the thing beyond the ship that confirmed that the ship was
somewhere, going somewhere, surrounded by something.

And now they were gone.

Elin began to notice changes. The corridors felt quieter. Conversations
became shorter, more perfunctory. The dining hall on Deck Seven, which
was normally loud with the cheerful chaos of four hundred people eating
in shifts, took on a subdued quality, as though people were listening
for something they could not hear. Two children on Deck Three stopped
sleeping. A maintenance worker on Deck Nine filed a report stating that
the walls of his quarters were "closer than they used to be." The ship's
single psychologist, Dr. Annika Falk, noted a twelve percent increase
in appointments within the first ten days.

"It is an orientation response," Dr. Falk told Elin, when Elin visited
her office to discuss the trend. "Humans are spatial creatures. We
navigate by reference points. When all external reference points are
removed, the mind becomes — unsettled."

"The ship has internal reference points," Elin said. "Corridors. Deck
numbers. The rotation axis."

"Those are cognitive references. I am speaking of something more
primitive. The body wants to know where it is in relation to the world.
When the world disappears, the body grows anxious."

"The world has not disappeared. We are in a region of space with very
low stellar density."

Dr. Falk looked at her with the patient expression of someone who dealt
with human irrationality professionally. "Try explaining that to the
body."

Elin returned to the observatory and looked through the observation
port. Nothing. She looked at the navigational instruments: position
confirmed, velocity nominal, course unchanged. The ship was proceeding
as it had proceeded for a century and a half, propelled by the same
engines, held together by the same hull, carrying the same cargo of
human lives toward the same destination.

Nothing had changed except what was outside. And what was outside was
nothing.

She sat at her console and opened her observation log. For eleven
years, she had maintained this log — a daily record of stellar
positions, magnitudes, spectral classifications, and any anomalies
observed. It was, she knew, a modest contribution to science. The
ship's telescopes were adequate but not exceptional. The data she
collected was useful primarily for confirming the navigational
computer's position calculations, which it did very well without her
help. But the log gave her work a structure, and the structure gave her
days a shape, and the shape was something she needed the way a wall
needs a foundation.

She opened a new entry and wrote the date. Then she wrote: "Observation
log, Day 1 of Lacuna transit. No objects observed."

She looked at the sentence. It was accurate. It was also, she felt, a
lie — not a lie of fact but a lie of completeness. "No objects observed"
suggested that she had looked and found nothing, when in truth she had
looked and found something: the void itself. The emptiness was not a
lack of data. It was data. It was information of a kind that she had
never recorded before, because she had never needed to.

She deleted the sentence and wrote: "Observation log, Day 1 of Lacuna
transit. The void is uniform and without variation. It extends in all
directions to the limit of instrument sensitivity. It is the most
remarkable thing I have ever observed."

She read this back to herself. It was better. It was also, she
suspected, the beginning of something she could not yet name.

                               III.

On the fourteenth day, Elin began to map the emptiness.

The idea came to her during a sleepless period — not quite night, since
the Fröja's lighting cycle was artificial and arbitrary, but the dim
hours when most of the ship rested and the corridors were quiet. She
lay in her bunk on Deck Seven and stared at the ceiling and thought
about what it meant to observe nothing.

An astronomer's training was the training of attention. You learned to
look at the sky and see not a uniform field of points but a structured
landscape of distances, temperatures, compositions, and motions. Each
star was a datum. Each gap between stars was a datum. The pattern of
presence and absence together formed the picture, the way the notes and
silences together formed the music.

But what happened when there were only silences?

She rose and went to the observatory. Henrik was asleep; Rúna was on
the communications deck. Elin was alone with the instruments and the
void. She sat at the main console and initiated a full-spectrum scan —
radio, infrared, visible, ultraviolet, X-ray — sweeping a cone of
observation thirty degrees in diameter, centered on the ship's heading.

The scan returned nothing. Or rather, it returned a nothing so pure,
so absolute, that it acquired a character of its own. The cosmic
microwave background was there, of course — the faint, uniform whisper
of radiation left over from the universe's birth. But superimposed on
that background, where there should have been the signatures of matter
— the absorption lines of interstellar gas, the thermal emissions of
dust, the telltale fluctuations that indicated mass of any kind — there
was a silence so deep that Elin felt her breath catch.

She saved the scan data and opened a new file. She labeled it: "Atlas
of Emptiness — Volume I, Section 1."

She did not know yet what the atlas would contain. She knew only that
the void deserved documentation — not as an absence, not as a gap in
the record, but as a thing in itself. A terrain. A landscape. A place
with its own properties, its own dimensions, its own character, as real
and as worthy of study as any nebula or star cluster.

She began with the basics. Position: coordinates relative to the
ship's origin point at Sol. Extent: the estimated diameter of the
Lacuna, as derived from the navigational charts compiled by the pre-
launch survey. Stellar density: zero, confirmed. Interstellar medium
density: below the instrument threshold of 0.01 atoms per cubic
centimeter. Temperature: 2.726 Kelvin, consistent with the cosmic
microwave background and nothing else.

These were numbers. They described the emptiness in the language of
measurement, which was a good language, a precise language. But it was
not, Elin felt, sufficient. The numbers captured the quantity of the
void. They did not capture its quality.

She stared at the observation port. The nothing stared back. She wrote:

     Section 1, Observation 1: The Lacuna is not dark. Darkness
     implies the obstruction or absence of light. The Lacuna is
     transparent. Light passes through it unimpeded, unabsorbed,
     unreflected. The void does not swallow light. It ignores it.
     This is a distinction that the instruments do not record but
     that the eye perceives. The eye perceives that it is looking
     through something, not at something. The experience is closer
     to looking through a window into an unlit room than to looking
     at a wall.

She read it back. It was not science. It was not the kind of writing
that would appear in a peer-reviewed journal, had peer-reviewed journals
existed on a generation ship. It was something else — observation that
included the observer. Description that admitted the act of describing.

She continued writing.

                               IV.

By the end of the first month, the atlas had grown to forty-seven pages.

Elin worked on it during every free hour. She carried the manuscript
with her in a cloth folder — actual paper, requisitioned from the
print shop on Deck Eight, because she found that writing by hand
changed the quality of her attention. She wrote in the observatory, in
the dining hall, in her bunk during the dim hours. She wrote with a
pencil that she sharpened with a small knife, and the physical act of
sharpening — the blade against the wood, the curl of shaving, the
exposed graphite — became part of the ritual.

The atlas was organized by sector. Elin had divided the Lacuna into a
grid — arbitrary, since there were no landmarks to anchor it, but
necessary for the same reason that a blank page needed margins. Each
sector received its own entry: coordinates, instrument readings, and
then the observations.

The observations were the heart of the work.

     Section 7, Observation 3: At the boundary between Sector 12
     and Sector 13, the cosmic microwave background shows a
     variation of 0.0003 Kelvin. This is within the noise floor of
     the ship's instruments and is almost certainly meaningless.
     I record it anyway, because in a place where nothing varies,
     the smallest variation is an event. A desert traveler does
     not ignore a pebble.

     Section 12, Observation 1: I have been observing this sector
     for three days and I find that the void here has a different
     character than the void in the sectors behind us. I cannot
     say in what way it differs. The instruments show no
     difference. But I look through the port at Sector 12 and I
     feel that the emptiness is — I lack the word. Attentive.
     As though the void is aware that it is being observed.
     I do not believe this. I record it because the observation
     log should reflect what the observer experiences, even when
     the experience is irrational.

     Section 15, Observation 7: There is a beauty here that I did
     not expect. Not the beauty of stars, which is the beauty of
     presence — of light and color and the knowledge that something
     is burning at an immense distance. This is the beauty of
     absence. The beauty of a blank page. Of silence in a concert
     hall before the music begins. The void is not desolation. It
     is potential. It is the universe holding its breath.

Henrik found her writing in the observatory one evening and stood behind
her for a moment, reading over her shoulder. He was a kind man, careful
of other people's work.

"What is this?" he asked.

"An atlas."

"Of what?"

"Of the emptiness."

Henrik was quiet for a long moment. He was a practical astronomer — a
man of spectrographs and calibration curves, not given to metaphysical
flights. But he had known Elin for eight years, and he knew that she
was not given to them either.

"Is it science?" he asked.

"I do not know what it is. It is what I see."

"You see nothing. We all see nothing."

"Yes. But there are different kinds of nothing. I am trying to describe
them."

Henrik pulled up a chair and sat beside her. He read three pages in
silence. Then he said: "The variation in Sector 12. The 0.0003 Kelvin
reading."

"Noise. Almost certainly."

"Almost certainly. But you measured it."

"Yes."

"And you would measure it again, if we passed through Sector 12 again."

"Yes."

Henrik nodded slowly. He did not say that the atlas was valuable, or
that it was not valuable. He said: "I would like to read more, when
you have written it."

"You may read all of it. Whenever you like."

He looked through the observation port at the void, and Elin saw
something change in his face — not a dramatic change, not the wide-eyed
revelation she had experienced, but a subtle shift, as though he were
seeing the emptiness for the first time not as a problem to be endured
but as a thing to be known.

"It is strange," he said, "to look at nothing and feel that there is
something to learn."

"Yes," Elin said. "It is strange. And it is true."

                               V.

The atlas became known.

Elin did not intend this. She had conceived the project as private work
— personal observation, not public document. But ships are small
societies, and small societies have no secrets that last longer than a
week. Rúna read the atlas and told a friend in communications. The
friend told a botanist on the agricultural deck. The botanist told her
husband, who was a schoolteacher on Deck Six. The schoolteacher read
three pages to his students.

The students began visiting the observatory.

They came in small groups — two or three at a time, children of nine
and ten and eleven, standing at the observation port with their faces
pressed against the glass, looking at nothing. They asked Elin questions.

"What is out there?"

"Nothing that our instruments can detect."

"Is it really empty?"

"As empty as anything we have ever measured."

"Then why are you writing about it?"

This was the question that Elin could not answer simply, so she
answered it as honestly as she could: "Because I think the emptiness
is worth writing about. Because no one has described this place before,
and it deserves to be described. Because the void is part of the
universe, and we are travelers in the universe, and travelers should
record what they pass through."

The children accepted this with the uncomplicated gravity of the young.
They began making their own observations. A girl named Maja, eleven
years old and serious beyond her age, brought Elin a drawing of the
view from the observation port: a circle of blank paper with a thin
line at the edge to indicate the frame of the glass. "It is a portrait
of the Lacuna," she said. "I drew exactly what I saw."

Elin pinned the drawing to the wall of the observatory beside her own
notes. It was, she thought, the most honest piece of art the ship had
ever produced.

Adults came too. They came singly, in the quiet hours, when the
observatory was dim and empty. They stood at the port and looked out,
and some of them asked to read the atlas, and Elin let them, watching
their faces as they turned the pages.

The reactions varied. Some found the atlas bewildering — "You have
written forty pages about nothing?" — and left shaking their heads.
Others found it beautiful. A woman from the machine shop on Deck Ten
read the entry about the beauty of absence and wept, silently, standing
in the observatory with the pages in her hands, and when Elin asked if
she was all right, the woman said: "My mother died last year. I did not
know how to describe what she left behind. Now I do."

And some found it necessary. These were the people most affected by the
Lacuna — the ones who could not sleep, the ones who felt the walls
closing, the ones who sat in the dining hall and stared at their plates
and could not explain what was wrong. Dr. Falk began recommending the
atlas to her patients. "It gives the void a name," she told Elin. "And
things that have names are less frightening than things that do not."

                               * * *

In the fifth month, the captain summoned Elin to the bridge.

Captain Njord Bergström was a third-generation shipborn, like Elin. He
was a competent, steady man of fifty-four with a lined face and the
careful manner of someone who had spent his life making decisions that
affected four thousand people and had learned not to make them quickly.
He stood at the bridge's central console with his hands clasped behind
his back and the navigational display glowing on the wall behind him — a
chart of the Fröja's course, a thin red line traversing a field of
absolute blankness.

"Astronomer Dahl," he said. "I have been hearing about your atlas."

"Yes, Captain."

"I would like to understand what it is."

Elin considered how to explain the atlas to a man whose relationship
with space was navigational rather than observational. "It is a record
of the void, Captain. A systematic description of the Lacuna, sector
by sector, as we pass through it."

"A description of emptiness."

"Yes."

"To what purpose?"

"The purpose of any atlas. To document a place. To describe its
characteristics. To leave a record for those who come after us."

Bergström looked at the navigational display. "No ship will come this
way again for generations. Perhaps never. The Lacuna is a navigational
obstacle. Future ships will chart courses to avoid it."

"That may be true. But we are here. And I believe what we pass through
is worth recording, regardless of whether anyone follows."

The captain was silent for a time. He was not a man of learning — he
had been trained in ship systems, navigation, and command, and his
reading was confined to technical manuals and the occasional novel from
the ship's library. But he was, Elin knew, a man who listened.

"There have been complaints," he said.

"About the atlas?"

"About the observatory. About resources being used for — I am quoting
the resource committee — 'non-essential documentation of non-existent
phenomena.'"

"The phenomena are not non-existent. The void is a phenomenon."

"The resource committee would disagree."

"The resource committee has not looked through the observation port."

A brief pause. Something that might have been amusement passed across
Bergström's face. "No," he said. "I imagine they have not."

He turned from the display and looked at her directly. "Continue your
work, Astronomer Dahl. I will address the resource committee. But I
would ask you to provide me with a copy of the atlas. I would like to
read it."

"Of course, Captain."

She provided the copy the following day. She did not learn until much
later that Bergström read it in its entirety in a single sitting, and
that when he had finished, he sat alone on the bridge for a long time,
looking at the navigational display and the thin red line and the
blankness that surrounded it, and that he said, to no one, in the
quiet of the empty bridge: "She is right. It is beautiful."

                               VI.

The atlas grew.

In the seventh month, it exceeded one hundred pages. In the ninth
month, it exceeded two hundred. Elin wrote every day, without
interruption, with the steady discipline of a woman who had found her
life's work and recognized it.

The entries became more varied. The early sections had been primarily
descriptive — observations of the void's character, its uniformity,
the minute and probably illusory variations that she recorded with
scrupulous care. But as the months passed and the ship moved deeper
into the Lacuna, the atlas evolved. New categories emerged.

There was a section on the void's effect on human perception. Elin
interviewed forty-six crew members about their experience of the
Lacuna, recording their descriptions with the same precision she
applied to instrument readings. The interviews revealed patterns. Many
people experienced the void as a sound — a low, constant tone at the
edge of hearing, like a note sustained on an organ in a distant room.
Others experienced it as a pressure — a faint, even compression, as
though the emptiness had weight. Three people independently described
the sensation of being watched, though they could not say by what or
from where.

     Subject Interview 23 (Deck Four maintenance technician,
     male, age 41): "I know there is nothing out there. I am
     not a superstitious man. But when I think about it — when I
     really think about the fact that there is nothing in any
     direction for light-years — I feel as though I am standing
     in the palm of a very large hand. Not a threatening hand.
     Just — large. And patient. And aware."

There was a section on the void's effect on the ship's systems.
The Fröja's engineers reported no malfunctions, no anomalies, no
deviations from normal operational parameters. And yet the ship felt
different. The air recyclers maintained the same atmospheric
composition, but the air tasted different — cleaner, thinner, as though
it had been filtered through something that removed not impurities but
qualities. The lighting was unchanged, but the light seemed different —
more direct, more defined, with sharper edges to the shadows it cast.
Elin recorded these observations and noted that they were subjective,
unverifiable, and possibly imaginary, and that she believed every one
of them.

There was a section on the void's relationship to time. This was the
most difficult section to write, because it concerned an experience
that Elin could not verify and could barely articulate. Time in the
Lacuna felt different. Not faster or slower — the ship's clocks
maintained their steady count, and the daily routine proceeded as
always. But the quality of time had changed. The hours felt — the word
Elin reached for, again and again, and found inadequate, was
transparent. Time in the Lacuna was transparent time. Time that you
could see through, to something on the other side.

     Atlas, Volume II, Section 4, Observation 11: I am aware
     that this observation will strain the reader's patience.
     I ask the reader to consider that I have been a working
     astronomer for eleven years, that I am trained in the
     disciplines of empirical measurement, and that I do not
     write what I do not observe. What I observe is this: time
     in the Lacuna is thinner. I do not mean that it passes more
     quickly. I mean that the barrier between one moment and the
     next is less substantial. The present feels closer to the
     past and to the future, as though the padding that normally
     separates them has been removed. I cannot measure this. I
     cannot prove it. I can only record it and leave the
     interpretation to others.

                               VII.

In the eleventh month, Elin discovered that the void was not entirely
empty.

She had been running the full-spectrum scan as part of her daily
routine — a sweep of the observation cone, automated, requiring
nothing more than a keypress and a patient hour while the instruments
cycled through the frequencies. She ran the scan every day, not because
she expected it to find anything, but because the discipline of looking
was itself the point. An astronomer who stopped looking because she
expected to see nothing was no longer an astronomer.

On Day 327 of the Lacuna transit, the scan returned an anomaly.

It was small — so small that the automated analysis software had
flagged it as noise and filed it in the error log rather than the
observation log. Elin found it only because she had developed the habit
of reviewing the error logs manually, a practice she had begun in the
third month after noticing that the software's noise filters were
calibrated for star-rich environments and might be miscategorized in
the void.

The anomaly was a thermal signature. A point source, bearing 042 by
017, at a distance the instruments could not determine precisely — the
return was too faint for ranging. The temperature was 3.1 Kelvin. This
was 0.374 degrees above the cosmic microwave background.

It was a whisper. A breath. The faintest possible indication that
something, somewhere in the void, was warmer than nothing.

Elin stared at the reading for a long time. Then she recalibrated the
instruments and ran the scan again. The anomaly was still there. She
ran it a third time, with different filter settings. Still there. She
called Henrik.

He came to the observatory in his nightclothes, his thin hair
disordered, his eyes heavy with interrupted sleep. He looked at the
readings without speaking. He ran the scan himself, twice. He checked
the calibration logs. He sat at the console and pressed his fingertips
against his temples in the way he did when he was thinking very
carefully.

"It is real," he said.

"Yes."

"It should not be here."

"No."

"Do you know what it is?"

"No. The signature is consistent with — " she paused, because the words
she was about to say sounded absurd even to her — "a mass. A small
mass. At very low temperature. Radiating just above the background."

"What kind of mass?"

"I do not know. The spectral data is insufficient for composition
analysis. It is simply — something. In a place where there should be
nothing."

Henrik looked at the observation port. The void was the same as it
had always been — uniform, absolute, featureless.

"A pebble in the desert," he said.

Elin nodded. She opened the atlas to a new page and wrote:

     Atlas, Volume II, Section 19, Observation 1: An anomaly has
     been detected. Bearing 042 by 017. Temperature 3.1 K.
     Nature: unknown. Significance: unknown. But it is there. In
     the deepest void we have ever traversed, at the farthest
     point from anything, something exists. I record this with
     the same precision I have applied to the void itself, and
     with the additional observation that my hands, as I write
     this, are trembling.

                               VIII.

The anomaly changed things.

Word spread through the ship within hours — in a community of four
thousand, news traveled at the speed of conversation. People came to
the observatory to look at the instrument reading, which was a set of
numbers on a screen and not, in any visual sense, dramatic. But they
came anyway. They stood before the console and looked at the numbers
the way a person lost in a wilderness looks at a distant light.

"What is it?" they asked.

"We do not know," Elin said, each time.

"Is it a star?"

"No. It is too cold, too small. It is — something else."

"Is it alive?"

This question, asked by a child, made Elin pause longer than any of
the others. "We have no evidence of that," she said. "But we do not
have evidence against it, either."

The ship's navigation officer, Commander Thea Lindgren, came to the
observatory and asked whether the anomaly was a navigation hazard. Elin
told her it was not — at its estimated distance, it posed no risk of
collision, and the ship's course did not need to be altered. Lindgren
nodded and left, but Elin noticed that she returned the next day, and
the day after that, and that she stood at the observation port each
time and looked at the void with an expression that was no longer
navigational but something closer to wonder.

Captain Bergström asked whether the anomaly could be investigated.

"Not without altering course," Elin said. "The object is off our line
of transit. To approach it would require a deviation of approximately
two degrees, which would add — " she consulted her calculations — "seven
months to our journey."

"Seven months."

"Approximately."

Bergström considered this. Seven months, in a voyage of two centuries,
was a small delay. But the Fröja's resources were finite, and every
month of extended travel consumed food, fuel, and the patience of
people who had been traveling since before they were born.

"The resource committee will not approve it," he said.

"No."

"And you? What would you recommend?"

Elin looked at the captain. She thought about the atlas, and the void,
and the small warm point in the infinite cold. She thought about the
woman from the machine shop who had wept in the observatory, and the
children who came to press their faces against the glass, and the
maintenance technician who felt that he was standing in the palm of a
very large hand.

"I would recommend that we go," she said. "Not because the anomaly is
scientifically significant — it may not be. But because we have been
traveling through emptiness for a year, and we have learned that
emptiness is a thing that can be mapped, and studied, and even loved.
And now there is something in the emptiness. And I believe that a ship
of travelers, passing through a place where nothing exists, has an
obligation to look at the one thing that does."

Bergström was quiet for a long time. Then he said: "Prepare a proposal.
I will present it to the council."

The council debated for three days. The resource committee objected.
The engineering department expressed concern about fuel margins. The
agricultural section worried about the extended growing season
required. The school deck parents worried about the delay in reaching
Tau Ceti, where their children's children might someday walk on solid
ground beneath a real sky.

The vote was taken on a Thursday evening. The council chamber was
full — standing room only, which had not happened since the water
recycling crisis of Year 133. The vote was 11 to 7 in favor of the
deviation.

The Fröja altered course.

                               IX.

It took six weeks to reach the anomaly.

During those weeks, Elin spent every available hour at the instruments,
tracking the thermal signature as it grew incrementally stronger,
watching the numbers climb by thousandths of a degree. Henrik worked
beside her, calibrating and recalibrating, refining the measurements
with the obsessive care of a man who knew that what they were
approaching might be the most significant observation of his career.

At a distance of one hundred astronomical units, the anomaly resolved
into something the instruments could characterize. It was solid — a
body, roughly spherical, approximately fourteen meters in diameter.
Its surface temperature was 3.2 Kelvin. Its albedo was nearly zero. It
was composed of — Elin checked the spectrographic analysis three times
before she accepted it — iron. Pure iron, with trace amounts of nickel
and cobalt, in a crystalline structure that the database identified as
consistent with a metallic meteorite of extraordinary purity.

A ball of iron, fourteen meters across, adrift in the deepest void
between the stars.

At a distance of ten AU, they could see it through the telescope —
a dark sphere against the dark, visible only because the Fröja's
searchlights cast a faint gleam on its surface. It was smooth.
Unnaturally smooth. Not the pitted, scarred surface of a meteorite
that had spent eons tumbling through space, but a polished surface,
regular and featureless, as though it had been machined.

"It is artificial," Henrik said, in a voice that was barely a whisper.

Elin did not reply. She was writing.

     Atlas, Volume III, Section 1, Observation 1: We have found
     it. At the center of the deepest void in our navigational
     charts, in a region where no star shines and no matter
     gathers, there is an object. It is iron. It is spherical.
     It is smooth. It appears to have been made.

     I do not know who made it, or when, or why. I do not know
     whether it was placed here deliberately or arrived here by
     some process we cannot imagine. I do not know whether it is
     a monument, a marker, a tool, or something for which we have
     no category.

     What I know is this: in a place of absolute emptiness,
     someone — something — left a mark. The void is not
     unclaimed. The emptiness has been visited before. We are
     not the first to pass through this place, and whatever
     passed before us wanted it known.

The Fröja approached to within one kilometer and held station. For
three days, every instrument on the ship was trained on the iron sphere.
They measured its mass, its magnetic field, its thermal profile. They
swept it with radar and sonar. They listened for transmissions on every
frequency. They photographed it from every angle.

They learned almost nothing. The sphere was iron. It was smooth. It
was old — the isotopic analysis suggested an age of at least two
billion years, though the uncertainty was large. It had no markings,
no openings, no features of any kind. It was a sphere and nothing
more.

And yet it was enough.

Captain Bergström came to the observatory on the second day. He stood
at the port and looked at the sphere, a dark circle barely visible
against the dark, illuminated by the ship's lights.

"What do you think it is?" he asked.

"I think it is what the atlas is about," Elin said. "I think it is the
reason the void exists. Not in a causal sense — I do not mean that the
sphere created the void. I mean that the void and the sphere belong
together. The emptiness is the frame. The sphere is the content. You
cannot understand either without the other."

"That is not a scientific statement."

"No. It is an observation."

Bergström looked at her. "You have been making observations for over
a year. You have documented the void more thoroughly than anyone in
the history of human spaceflight. And you are telling me that the most
important thing you have observed is a ball of iron that you cannot
explain."

"I am telling you that the most important thing I have observed is
that the void is not empty. That even in the most absolute absence,
there is a presence. That the map is never truly blank."

The captain looked at the sphere for a long time. Then he said: "Put
it in the atlas."

"I already have."

                               X.

The Fröja resumed its course toward Tau Ceti. The iron sphere
diminished behind them, swallowed by the void, until the instruments
could no longer detect it and the void was, once again, complete.

Three more years of the Lacuna remained. Elin knew this. She sat at
her console in the observatory, with the atlas open before her and the
observation port framing the familiar, absolute nothing, and she felt
no dread. The void was her terrain now. She knew it as well as anyone
could know a place that was defined by the absence of everything
knowable.

She continued to write. The atlas grew. Volume III documented the iron
sphere and the questions it raised. Volume IV returned to the void
itself — its qualities, its textures, its many silences. Volume V,
which she began in the second year and worked on for the remainder of
the transit, was the most ambitious section: a meditation on emptiness
as a category of experience, drawing on the observations she had made,
the interviews she had conducted, and the slow, accumulating wisdom
of a woman who had spent years looking at nothing and finding, in that
nothing, a fullness she could not have anticipated.

     Atlas, Volume V, Section 12, Final Observation: We are
     nearing the far boundary of the Lacuna. In three months,
     the first stars will appear in the observation port — faint,
     distant, but real. The void will end, and we will return
     to the populated universe, with its lights and its dust and
     its dense, cluttered beauty.

     I am not ready to leave.

     This will seem strange. The Lacuna has been, for most of
     the ship's population, an ordeal — a long, disquieting
     passage through a place that offered nothing to see, nothing
     to hear, nothing to hold. They have endured it. They are
     glad it is ending.

     I understand this. And I do not share it.

     The void has given me something that the stars never did.
     Not knowledge — the atlas contains very little that would
     satisfy a scientist. Not comfort — the void is not
     comforting. What it has given me is attention. The void
     demanded that I look at it, really look, with nothing
     to distract me and nothing to fall back on. It demanded
     that I see what was there, which was nothing, and that
     I find in that nothing something worth recording. It
     taught me that observation is not a function of the
     thing observed. It is a function of the observer.

     I mapped the emptiness. I gave it coordinates and
     descriptions and a name. The atlas is four hundred and
     twelve pages long, and it is a record of nothing, and
     it is the truest thing I have ever written.

     The void will end. The stars will return. The universe
     will fill the observation port with its ancient,
     familiar light, and I will record it as I have always
     done, with precision and with care.

     But I will miss the emptiness. I will miss its silence,
     its patience, its terrible and beautiful indifference.
     I will miss the way it made me look.

     I will miss the nothing that taught me how to see.

When the first star appeared — a faint red point, barely visible, at
the extreme edge of the observation port's field of view — Elin was
alone in the observatory. It was the dim hours. The ship was quiet. She
saw the star and felt two things simultaneously: relief, which was the
body's response to the return of context, and grief, which was the
heart's response to the end of something that could not be repeated.

She opened the atlas to the last page and wrote:

     Atlas of Emptiness — Final Entry: A star has appeared.
     Bearing 003 by 001. Magnitude approximately 14. Spectral
     classification pending.

     The Lacuna is behind us.

     The atlas is complete.

She closed the book. She held it in her hands — four hundred and twelve
pages of handwritten observations, the weight of two years of looking
at nothing. She held it the way you hold something precious and
fragile, something that cannot be replaced.

Through the observation port, the star burned. Small, red, impossibly
distant. But real. A point of light in the void, like a period at the
end of a very long sentence.

The Fröja moved on. The atlas remained.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                           BORDERLINE

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The customs station at the edge of human space was called, with the
grim humor common to government employees stationed in remote
locations, the Last Stop. Its official designation was Terran
Administrative Boundary Station 1, Sector 7-G, but nobody used the
official designation except on forms, and even on forms the clerks
had been known to abbreviate it to "the Stop" and let the auditors
sort it out.

It was not an impressive facility. It occupied a converted fuel depot
on the surface of a captured asteroid, designation KR-441, which
orbited a dim red star at the outermost edge of the territory claimed
by the Terran Commonwealth. The station consisted of a pressurized
dome containing four offices, a waiting room, a canteen that served
reconstituted coffee and sandwiches of ambiguous origin, and a
processing hall where arrivals were documented, inspected, and either
admitted or turned away.

George Hadley had been the senior customs officer at the Last Stop for
eleven years, and he had processed every kind of case the galaxy could
produce. He had admitted scientists, refugees, diplomats, merchants,
missionaries, tourists, con artists, and one individual who claimed to
be a time traveler from the twenty-eighth century and who, upon being
asked for identification, had produced a library card from a library
that would not be built for four hundred years. George had stamped the
card and let him through. It was not his job to evaluate the plausibility
of time travel. It was his job to check documents.

George was a stocky man of forty-seven with thinning brown hair, a
patient face, and the unflappable calm of someone who had long ago
accepted that the universe was fundamentally absurd and that his role
in it was to process the absurdity in triplicate. He wore the standard
customs service uniform — dark blue tunic, gray trousers, black boots
that he polished every morning with a care that his ex-wife had once
described as "the only passion in your life, George" — and he kept his
desk in meticulous order: forms on the left, stamps on the right,
coffee mug in the center, exactly where he could reach it without
looking.

He arrived at his desk at 0800 hours, as he did every morning. He
straightened his forms. He aligned his stamps. He poured his coffee.
He opened the day's docket, which contained the list of arrivals
scheduled for processing.

The first entry read: "Species: Vlendari. Category: Asylum seeker.
Reason for entry: Biological."

George took a sip of coffee. It was going to be one of those days.

                               II.

The Vlendari entered the processing hall at 0830, accompanied by a
translation drone that hovered at approximately head height and emitted
a faint, apologetic hum. George had dealt with Vlendari before — they
were a common species in this sector, roughly humanoid in shape but
composed of a semi-liquid biomass contained within a flexible membrane.
They were polite, formal, and tended to leave small puddles on the
furniture, which the janitorial staff had learned to accept as a cost
of interstellar relations.

This particular Vlendari was unusually agitated. Its membrane was
rippling in patterns that George recognized, from the cultural
sensitivity training he had been required to complete every year
for the past eleven years, as distress. It settled into the interview
chair with a moist, settling sound and regarded George through eyespots
that shifted position on its surface like bubbles in a lava lamp.

"Good morning," George said. "I am Senior Customs Officer George
Hadley. Please state your name for the record."

The Vlendari emitted a series of harmonic vibrations. The translation
drone processed them and produced: "My name, in the nearest human
phonetic approximation, is Threll-who-was-Shallow-Pool-at-Dawn."

George wrote this down. He had learned long ago not to abbreviate
alien names. "And your reason for seeking asylum, Threll-who-was-
Shallow-Pool-at-Dawn?"

Another series of vibrations, longer this time, with undertones that
the drone struggled to render. "I am seeking asylum from my own
biology."

George set his pen down. "I beg your pardon?"

"I am seeking asylum from my own biology. Specifically, from the
Vlendari reproductive cycle."

"I see." George did not see. He picked up his pen again and made a
note: "Biological asylum claim — reproductive." He had processed asylum
claims based on political persecution, religious persecution, economic
hardship, environmental collapse, and one memorable case involving a
species that was being persecuted by its own moon. But this was new.

"Could you elaborate?"

Threll-who-was-Shallow-Pool-at-Dawn's membrane rippled in what the
drone translated as a sigh. "In the Vlendari lifecycle, individuals
who reach the age of maturity — which I have now reached — undergo a
process called the Confluence. During the Confluence, the individual's
biomass is absorbed into the collective substrate of the homeworld's
ocean, and the individual ceases to exist as a separate entity."

"Ceases to exist."

"Yes. My memories, my personality, my consciousness — all of it is
dissolved into the collective. The substrate gains my biological
material. I gain nothing. I cease."

"And this is — mandatory?"

"It is biological. It is not a law. It is what Vlendari bodies do when
they reach a certain age. My body is currently in the preliminary
stages of Confluence preparation. I am — " the membrane rippled
violently — "beginning to lose coherence. If I remain on the homeworld,
or in Vlendari space, the proximity to the collective substrate will
accelerate the process. I will dissolve within three standard months."

George looked at the Vlendari. Now that it had been pointed out, he
could see it — the membrane was less defined than it should have been,
the edges soft, almost fuzzy, as though the being were very slightly
out of focus.

"And if you remain outside Vlendari space?"

"The process slows dramatically. Without the proximity of the
collective substrate, my body will maintain coherence for — according
to our physicians — between ten and thirty standard years. I will
eventually dissolve. It is inevitable. But I will have time."

"Time for what?"

Threll-who-was-Shallow-Pool-at-Dawn was quiet for a moment. The
eyespots drifted across its surface and settled in a position that
George's training told him indicated direct regard.

"Time to be myself," the Vlendari said. "I have only been myself for
twenty-three years. That is not enough. I have things I want to do.
Books I want to read — I have become very fond of human literature. I
have been reading Dickens. I would like to finish Dickens. I would
like to see a sunset. I have been told they are remarkable."

George made a note. He wrote it carefully, in his neat customs-service
hand: "Applicant seeks asylum to avoid involuntary loss of individual
identity through biological process. Claims continued existence
outside species territory. Wishes to read Dickens and observe sunset."

He looked at the note. He looked at the Vlendari, who was slowly
losing its edges in the interview chair, and who wanted to see a
sunset.

"I will need to file a Category Nine asylum application," George said.
"That requires a medical assessment confirming your biological claim,
a statement of intent regarding your planned activities in Terran
space, and — " he paused — "a sponsor. Do you have anyone who can act
as your sponsor?"

"No. I know no one. I came here alone."

George looked at the form. He looked at the Vlendari. He picked up his
stamp.

"I will act as your temporary sponsor," he said. "It is irregular, but
Section 14, Paragraph 7 of the Customs and Immigration Code permits a
processing officer to sponsor an applicant in cases of imminent
biological danger. Your application will be forwarded to the regional
office for review. In the meantime, you will be issued a provisional
entry permit."

He stamped the form. The sound was the same flat, bureaucratic thud it
always made, but it seemed, in this instance, to carry more weight.

"Welcome to Terran space, Threll-who-was-Shallow-Pool-at-Dawn. I hope
you enjoy the sunsets."

The Vlendari's membrane rippled in a pattern the drone did not
translate but that George, after eleven years at the edge of human
space, recognized as gratitude.

                               III.

The second case of the day arrived at 1030.

His name was Peter Hendricks, he was forty-one years old, and he was
human. He was also, according to the documents he presented, deceased.

"Your file indicates that your citizenship status is — expired," George
said, looking at the screen.

"That's what they tell me," Hendricks said. He was a thin, weathered
man with a two-day beard and the faded coveralls of a commercial
freighter pilot. He sat in the interview chair with the loose-limbed
ease of someone who had been sitting in uncomfortable chairs in
government offices for a long time.

"Can you explain the circumstances?"

"I can try. Three years ago, I was running cargo between Arcturus
Station and the Kepler Colonies. My ship hit a pocket of uncharted
gravitational distortion. I lost navigation, lost comms, and spent
fourteen months drifting before I was picked up by a Voskhandi trader
who was kind enough to drop me at the nearest relay station."

"Fourteen months."

"Fourteen months. During which time, the Terran Commonwealth declared
me legally dead. Standard procedure — if a registered citizen is out of
contact for more than twelve months with no confirmed survival data,
automatic death declaration."

"Yes, I'm familiar with the regulation."

"Well, here I am. Not dead. But according to your system, I don't
exist. My citizenship was revoked upon death. My property was
distributed. My bank accounts were closed. My pilot's license was
canceled." He spread his hands. "I am a man without a country, Officer
Hadley. Which is a hell of a thing to be when you're standing at the
only border crossing in fifty light-years."

George consulted the screen. The file was straightforward: Peter
Hendricks, born Titan Colony, Commonwealth citizenship granted at
birth, death declared Year 2347, Day 190, pursuant to Regulation
441-C. All associated records closed.

"The standard procedure for reinstatement of citizenship after an
erroneous death declaration is to file a Form 27-B, 'Petition for
Posthumous Reclassification as Living,'" George said.

Hendricks blinked. "Posthumous reclassification as living."

"That is the official term."

"It's a hell of a term."

"The form requires supporting evidence of continued biological
function, a sworn statement from two witnesses confirming your
identity, a medical examination, and — this is the part you will not
enjoy — a fee of three hundred and fifty credits for administrative
processing."

"I don't have three hundred and fifty credits. I don't have any
credits. My accounts are closed. Because I'm dead."

George looked at the screen. He looked at Hendricks. He looked at
the form. The regulations were clear: no entry without valid
citizenship or an approved visa. The regulations were also, in this
case, clearly absurd.

"Mr. Hendricks, are you familiar with Section 22, Paragraph 3 of the
Customs and Immigration Code?"

"I am not."

"It provides for temporary entry permits in cases of — " George
paused, searching for the subsection — "'bureaucratic paradox resulting
from the simultaneous application of contradictory regulations.' It
was written in 2298 after an incident involving a diplomat who was
technically at war with himself. The section is rarely invoked."

"I can imagine."

George filled in the form. "I am issuing you a temporary entry permit
under Section 22. You will have ninety days to file your petition for
reclassification. I would recommend visiting the Commonwealth
administrative office on Kepler-7, where they have a dedicated
department for — " he checked his notes — "resurrection paperwork."

"Resurrection paperwork."

"Apparently the problem is more common than one would think."

Hendricks took the stamped form and looked at it. A brief, complicated
expression crossed his face — relief, exhaustion, and a faint,
incredulous amusement. "Thank you, Officer Hadley."

"It is my job, Mr. Hendricks. Welcome back to the living."

                               IV.

Lunch at the Last Stop canteen was a reconstituted meatloaf sandwich
and a cup of coffee that tasted as though the beans had been roasted
in a previous century, which they possibly had. George ate at his usual
table by the viewport, looking out at the starfield and the slow
rotation of the asteroid's surface below. His junior officer, Marta
Voss, sat across from him, eating the same sandwich with the determined
expression of someone who had decided that complaining about the food
was a waste of energy that could be better spent complaining about
everything else.

"You sponsored an alien," Marta said.

"I did."

"George, you can't sponsor every sad case that comes through here."

"I don't. I sponsor the ones who want to read Dickens."

Marta gave him a look that was half exasperation, half something
warmer. She was twenty-eight, sharp, ambitious, and thoroughly baffled
by George's willingness to spend his career at the most remote posting
in the customs service. "One of these days, the regional office is
going to audit your sponsorship records and you're going to be in
trouble."

"The regional office does not know we exist. That is one of the
advantages of working at the edge of known space."

"And Hendricks? The dead man?"

"Alive, as it turns out. I have issued him a temporary permit under
Section 22."

"The bureaucratic paradox section? George, nobody uses Section 22."

"Somebody should. It is a very well-written section. I suspect it was
drafted by someone who understood the fundamental nature of
government."

Marta shook her head. But she was smiling. "What's the afternoon look
like?"

George checked the docket. He read the next entry twice, because the
first reading did not seem possible. Then he put down his sandwich.

"The afternoon," he said, "is going to be interesting."

                               V.

The entity that entered the processing hall at 1400 hours was not, in
any conventional sense, a person.

It was a cloud.

More precisely, it was a contained volume of luminescent gas
approximately two meters in diameter, faintly blue, with internal
currents that swirled and eddied in patterns that suggested, without
confirming, intentionality. It moved through the door of the processing
hall under its own power, drifting at about walking speed, and settled
in front of George's desk with a gentle, almost courteous deceleration.

The translation drone, which had been hovering near the ceiling since
the Vlendari interview, descended and attempted to establish a
communication link. It failed. The gas cloud did not produce sound
vibrations. It did not produce electromagnetic signals. It did not
produce anything that the drone's communication protocols recognized.

George waited.

After approximately thirty seconds, a small device detached itself
from the interior of the cloud and landed on George's desk. It was
a flat disc, about the size of a coin, made of a material that George
could not identify. When it landed, it began to emit text — projected
upward, in glowing letters that hung in the air between George and the
cloud.

The text read: "GREETINGS. I AM CLASSIFICATION UNKNOWN. I REQUEST
TOURIST VISA."

George picked up his pen. "Good afternoon. I am Senior Customs Officer
George Hadley. Can you state your name for the record?"

The disc projected: "I DO NOT HAVE A NAME IN YOUR LANGUAGE FRAMEWORK.
I AM A SELF-ORGANIZED COLLECTIVE OF APPROXIMATELY 10^14 GAS MOLECULES
WHICH HAVE ACHIEVED EMERGENT CONSCIOUSNESS THROUGH ELECTROSTATIC
INTERACTION PATTERNS. YOU MAY CALL ME WHATEVER IS CONVENIENT FOR YOUR
FORMS."

George considered this. "For the purposes of the form, I will need a
designation. Is there a name you prefer?"

"I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING THROUGH YOUR SECTOR FOR SOME TIME AND HAVE
BEEN MONITORING YOUR COMMUNICATIONS. I HAVE BECOME FOND OF THE HUMAN
NAME 'CAROL.'"

"Carol."

"YES."

"Species?"

"I AM NOT A SPECIES. I AM AN INDIVIDUAL. I EMERGED SPONTANEOUSLY IN
A MOLECULAR CLOUD IN WHAT YOUR CHARTS DESIGNATE AS SECTOR 12-F
APPROXIMATELY 400,000 OF YOUR YEARS AGO. I AM, AS FAR AS I AM AWARE,
UNIQUE."

George wrote: "Species: Sentient gas formation (unique). Name: Carol."

"Purpose of visit?"

"TOURISM. I HAVE BEEN TRAVELING BETWEEN STAR SYSTEMS FOR A VERY LONG
TIME AND I WOULD LIKE TO VISIT YOUR CIVILIZATION. SPECIFICALLY I AM
INTERESTED IN YOUR ARCHITECTURE, YOUR MUSIC, AND YOUR CONCEPT OF
'WEATHER,' WHICH I FIND FASCINATING AS IT APPEARS TO BE A FORM OF
ATMOSPHERIC BEHAVIOR THAT YOU DO NOT CONTROL."

"Duration of intended stay?"

"I HAD HOPED FOR TWO OF YOUR STANDARD WEEKS. HOWEVER, I UNDERSTAND
THAT MY PHYSICAL FORM MAY PRESENT LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES. I AM
WILLING TO BE FLEXIBLE."

George looked at the cloud. The cloud — Carol — drifted serenely before
his desk, its internal currents swirling in patterns that were, George
had to admit, rather beautiful.

"There are some procedural issues," George said. "A tourist visa
requires a valid identity document, proof of financial means to support
yourself during your stay, and a confirmed accommodation booking."

"I DO NOT HAVE IDENTITY DOCUMENTS. I DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE REQUIRED.
I ALSO DO NOT HAVE FINANCIAL MEANS IN YOUR CURRENCY. I HAVE NOT HAD
NEED OF CURRENCY FOR 400,000 YEARS. AS FOR ACCOMMODATION, I DO NOT
REQUIRE SHELTER. I AM COMFORTABLE IN MOST ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS. I
COULD RESIDE IN YOUR ATMOSPHERE."

"You would like to reside in our atmosphere."

"YES. I WOULD SIMPLY DRIFT. I AM VERY GOOD AT DRIFTING. I HAVE BEEN
DOING IT FOR 400,000 YEARS."

Marta, who had been listening from the adjacent desk, leaned over and
whispered: "George, you cannot issue a tourist visa to a cloud."

"Why not?"

"Because — because it's a cloud, George."

"The Customs and Immigration Code does not restrict visas by physical
state of matter. I have checked. The code refers to 'entities,' not
'organisms' or 'persons.' Carol is an entity."

"Carol is a gas."

"A sentient gas with a stated interest in architecture and weather.
I see no basis for denial."

Marta stared at him. George turned back to the cloud.

"Carol, I am going to issue you a provisional tourist visa under
Section 9, Paragraph 4, which covers entities of unclassified origin.
The visa is valid for thirty standard days. You will need to register
your position with the nearest Commonwealth administrative office at
least once per standard week. Do you understand these terms?"

"I DO. THANK YOU, OFFICER HADLEY. MAY I ASK A QUESTION?"

"Of course."

"WHAT IS 'WEATHER' LIKE? I HAVE OBSERVED IT FROM SPACE BUT NEVER
FROM WITHIN."

George looked through the viewport at the starfield. He thought about
rain, which he had not experienced since his last leave on Earth, seven
years ago. He thought about the feel of it on his face — the cold, the
randomness, the way it came from everywhere at once.

"It is very good," he said. "I think you will enjoy it."

"I LOOK FORWARD TO IT. I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THINGS FOR
ONLY A FEW THOUSAND YEARS. IT IS A RELATIVELY NEW EXPERIENCE FOR ME."

George stamped the form. Carol drifted toward the exit, trailing a
faint luminescence that lingered in the air like perfume. At the
door, the disc projected one last message:

"OFFICER HADLEY, YOU HAVE BEEN VERY KIND. I WILL REMEMBER YOU FOR A
VERY LONG TIME. POSSIBLY LONGER THAN YOUR SPECIES WILL EXIST. I MEAN
THAT AS A COMPLIMENT."

"I take it as one," George said. "Have a pleasant visit, Carol."

The cloud drifted out. The luminescence faded. George straightened
his forms.

                               VI.

At the end of the day, George sat alone in his office.

The canteen was closed. Marta had gone to the residential section. The
processing hall was empty, its fluorescent lights humming in the quiet.
Through the viewport, the stars were steady and indifferent and very
far away.

George opened his logbook. He wrote, in his careful hand:

     Day's cases: 3.
     1. Vlendari asylum seeker (biological). Provisional entry
        permit issued. Sponsored.
     2. Human citizen (deceased). Temporary entry permit issued
        under Section 22.
     3. Sentient gas formation (tourist). Provisional tourist
        visa issued under Section 9.

He looked at the log. Three cases. Three lives — if "life" was even the
right word for all of them — that had arrived at the edge of human
space and asked to be let in. Not because human space was the best
place in the galaxy, or the safest, or the most welcoming. But because
it was the place with a desk and a stamp and a man behind the desk who
would look at the form and look at the applicant and try, within the
constraints of a bureaucratic system designed by people who had never
imagined a sentient cloud, to do the right thing.

George had been doing this for eleven years. He had never been promoted.
He had never been transferred to a more prestigious posting. He had
been offered both, and he had declined both, and his ex-wife had cited
this as evidence of a fundamental lack of ambition that she could not
accept in a life partner. She was probably right. George did not have
ambition. What he had was a desk, and a stamp, and an unshakeable
conviction that the most important work in the universe was not
discovering new worlds or building faster ships or negotiating treaties
between great powers. It was sitting at the edge of everything and
saying, to whoever arrived: I see you. You exist. Let me find the
right form.

He closed the logbook. He finished his coffee. He polished his stamps,
one by one, and placed them in their drawer. He turned off the desk
lamp and sat for a moment in the dark, looking through the viewport
at the boundary of human space — the invisible line beyond which the
Commonwealth's authority ended and the galaxy's great, chaotic,
ungovernable strangeness began.

Three cases today. Tomorrow there would be more. There were always
more. The edge of human space was not a wall. It was a door.

George Hadley went home, and the door stayed open.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         TERRA INCOGNITA

                        by Cordell Beaumont

================================================================================

                               I.

The continent had no name, and Kael Renaud intended to give it one.

He stood at the prow of the survey skiff as it cut through the morning
mist of the Cethani Sea, one hand on the railing and the other holding
the battered leather case that contained his cartographic instruments.
The air was warm and heavy with moisture, tasting of brine and
something else — a sweetness, like overripe fruit, that came from the
forests of the mainland shore fifteen kilometers behind them. Ahead,
the mist lay on the water like a veil of spun glass, pale gold where
the system's twin suns caught it from the east, and beneath it the sea
moved in long, lazy swells the color of tarnished copper.

Ceth IV was a world of extravagant beauty, and Kael Renaud had spent
three years mapping it. He had charted the Amber Archipelago, where
volcanic islands rose from the sea in columns of basalt draped in
luminous orange lichen. He had mapped the Resonance Canyons of the
northern continent, where the wind played through natural stone
formations and produced harmonics that could be heard from fifty
kilometers away — a planetary music that changed with the season and
the weather and that the survey team's composer, a woman named DuPree,
had been recording with an expression of permanent, awed disbelief. He
had documented the Phosphor Marshes of the equatorial lowlands, where
bioluminescent organisms turned the wetlands into fields of cold blue
fire at night, and the Singing Forests of the western slope, where the
trees — tall, spire-like growths with translucent membranes stretched
between their branches — vibrated in the wind and produced a sound
like a thousand glass harmonicas playing in imperfect unison.

All of this he had drawn, measured, recorded, and archived. Three years
of work, three years of wonder, three years of a cartographer's
particular joy: the joy of giving shape to the unknown, of converting
the wild profusion of a new world into lines on paper, coordinates in
a database, names on a chart.

But the continent ahead — the last continent, the one the survey had
designated "Landmass Seven" and left for the final season — was
different. The mist was the first clue. It did not behave like normal
maritime fog. It was too regular, too even, too perfectly distributed
across the approach corridor, as though it had been arranged rather
than formed. The satellite surveys had shown the same anomaly from
orbit: a persistent cloud layer over Landmass Seven that defied the
planet's meteorological models. The clouds never broke. The continent's
surface had never been photographed.

"Something is keeping those clouds in place," Dr. Amara Osei had said,
at the expedition's planning meeting six weeks ago. Osei was the
team's atmospheric scientist, a tall, precise woman from the Ghanaian
highlands who treated the weather with the respect due a worthy
adversary. "The energy required to maintain a cloud formation of this
extent and duration is — considerable. I cannot identify a natural
mechanism."

"Volcanic activity?" Kael had suggested.

"Insufficient. The thermal readings are too uniform. Volcanic
outgassing would produce hot spots. This is — even. As though the
entire continent is being — " she paused, searching for the word —
"veiled."

Kael had made a note in his survey journal: "Landmass Seven: veiled."
And now he was sailing toward it, through mist that tasted of
sweetness and mystery, with the last blank space on his map lying
ahead of him like an invitation.

                               II.

The mist parted at noon.

It did not dissipate gradually, as natural fog does. It withdrew — a
deliberate, measured recession, the pale gold curtain drawing back
from the edges inward, revealing the coastline of Landmass Seven in
stages, like a painting being unveiled.

Kael lowered his binoculars and stared.

The shore was a crescent of white sand, fine as powdered bone, curving
between two headlands of dark stone. Behind the sand, a forest rose —
but it was not like the forests he had mapped on the other continents.
Those forests had been wild, exuberant, chaotic in the manner of all
living things left to their own devices. This forest was — the word
came to him before he could stop it — organized.

The trees were enormous. They dwarfed anything Kael had seen on
Ceth IV, their trunks as wide as buildings, their canopy so high that
it disappeared into a haze of green and gold light. But they were
spaced with a regularity that could not be natural. Equal distances
between trunks. Uniform height. The canopy interlocking above in a
pattern that was, Kael realized with a start, geometric — a tessellation
of hexagons, each leaf-cluster fitting into the next with the precision
of tiles in a mosaic.

Between the trees, the ground was covered in a low, dense growth of
something that looked like moss but shimmered with a faint iridescence
that shifted between violet and green. Paths ran through this growth —
not the random trails of animals, but straight, even paths that
intersected at right angles and disappeared into the forest's interior.

"Kael." The voice was Osei's, from behind him. She had come up from
the instrument bay and was standing at the railing, her dark face very
still. "Are you seeing this?"

"I am seeing it."

"Those paths are engineered."

"Yes."

"This continent is inhabited."

"Yes."

They looked at each other. In three years of surveying Ceth IV, they
had found no evidence of intelligent life. Abundant biology — the
planet's ecosystems were rich and varied and fascinating — but nothing
that suggested civilization. No structures. No agriculture. No
electromagnetic emissions. The planet had been classified as
uninhabited, suitable for colonization, and the survey team's job was
to complete the mapping before the colony ships arrived.

And now they were looking at a forest that someone had planted.

                               III.

They landed on the beach.

Kael was the first off the skiff, his boots sinking into sand so fine
it felt like flour. The twin suns were high now, and their light came
through the canopy of the enormous trees in shafts of green and amber,
casting patterns on the ground that shifted slowly as the canopy moved
in a wind so gentle it was barely perceptible.

The sweetness in the air was stronger here. Not cloying — not the
sugary heaviness of tropical flowers — but a complex, layered sweetness,
like a perfume composed by someone who understood that beauty was most
effective when it was understated. Beneath the sweetness, other scents:
earth, the sharp green smell of growing things, something mineral and
cool, like wet stone, and a faint undertone of something Kael could
not identify — a warmth, a richness, like the memory of spice.

He opened his leather case and took out his instruments: compass,
sextant, measuring chain, survey telescope, and the journal in which
he drew his maps. He had always drawn by hand, even though the
expedition's database could render a digital chart from satellite data
in minutes. Digital charts were accurate. Hand-drawn maps were true.
The difference, Kael believed, was the difference between recording a
place and understanding it. A map drawn by hand carried the cartographer's
attention in every line. It was a portrait, not a photograph.

He took a bearing on the nearer headland and began to sketch the
coastline. The sand crescent. The two dark headlands. The line where
the forest began. He drew the trees — their massive trunks, their
geometric canopy — and found that his hand wanted to linger, to add
detail, to capture something he could feel but not yet articulate.

"Kael."

It was Lissande Deveraux, the expedition's xenobiologist, calling from
the tree line. She was kneeling in the iridescent moss, her sampling
kit open beside her. "Come look at this."

He walked to where she knelt. The moss was remarkable up close — each
filament was about a centimeter tall, and instead of the simple
structure he expected, each one was intricately branched, like a
miniature tree, with the branches arranged in a fractal pattern that
repeated at smaller and smaller scales. The iridescence came from thin
membranes stretched between the branches, each membrane a slightly
different thickness, refracting the light into different wavelengths.

"It is the most complex ground cover I have ever seen," Lissande said.
Her voice had the hushed quality of someone in a cathedral. "Each
filament is — Kael, each filament is an organism of extraordinary
sophistication. The cellular structure is more complex than anything in
our database. And look — " She pointed with her sampling probe. "The
filaments are connected. Below the surface. A root network."

"Like mycorrhiza?"

"Like mycorrhiza, but orders of magnitude more complex. I would
need months to analyze it properly. This is not a simple ground
cover. This is a — " She paused, and Kael saw her reach for a word
and fail to find one adequate. "A substrate. A foundation. An
infrastructure."

"For what?"

Lissande looked up at him, and her eyes were bright with the
particular excitement that came from encountering something that
exceeded every expectation. "I do not know yet. But whatever it is,
it is vast."

                               IV.

They followed the paths into the forest.

The team numbered six: Kael, Osei, Lissande, the expedition's
geologist Dr. Roan Marchetti, pilot Tomás Ferreira, and security
officer Adama Sylla, who carried a sidearm that he clearly hoped he
would not need. They moved in single file along one of the straight
paths, and the forest closed around them like a green cathedral —
the canopy far above, the great trunks on either side, the iridescent
moss beneath their feet glowing faintly in the filtered light.

The path was perfectly maintained. No fallen branches, no encroaching
growth, no irregularities in the surface. The moss was trimmed to a
precise edge where it met the path's border, as though cut by a tool
of extraordinary fineness. The path itself was composed of a material
that Marchetti identified, after kneeling and scraping a sample, as a
ceramic of organic origin — something grown rather than manufactured,
but as hard and smooth as any ceramic Kael had ever encountered.

"Someone maintains these paths," Marchetti said. "Regularly.
Recently."

They walked for two hours. The forest did not change — the same
enormous trees, the same geometric canopy, the same iridescent moss —
but the sense of something building grew stronger with every step. The
air grew warmer. The sweetness intensified. And a sound began to
emerge from the silence — not the sounds of a forest, not the chirp
and rustle of animal life, but a deeper sound, more fundamental, like
a vibration rising from the ground itself. A hum. A resonance. A
tone so low it was felt in the chest rather than heard in the ears.

"Do you feel that?" Osei said.

Everyone felt it.

The path led them through a last rank of the great trees, and the
forest opened, and they stopped walking, and for a long moment nobody
spoke, because what lay before them was beyond anything they had
imagined.

                               * * *

It was a city.

But not a city as humans understood the word. Not a collection of
buildings separated by streets, a mechanical aggregation of structures
imposed upon a landscape. This was a city that had grown from the
landscape — that was the landscape, continuous with it, indistinguishable
from it, as though the forest and the civilization it sheltered were
a single living thing.

The structures rose from the ground like great organic forms —
curving, flowing, their surfaces covered in the same iridescent growth
that carpeted the forest floor. They had no sharp edges, no straight
lines, no seams. They swelled from the earth in shapes that suggested
seed pods, shells, the inner chambers of a nautilus — organic
geometries of breathtaking complexity and beauty. Their surfaces were
translucent in places, and through the translucency Kael could see
interior spaces filled with a warm amber light that seemed to have no
source.

Between the structures, gardens grew — or rather, compositions grew,
because "garden" implied a human sense of order, and what Kael saw was
an order far more sophisticated. Plants of a hundred varieties were
arranged in patterns that were simultaneously mathematical and
aesthetic, their colors progressing through gradients so subtle that the
eye moved from scarlet to violet to blue without ever detecting a
boundary. Waterways ran between the gardens, flowing in channels that
followed the curves of the structures, and the water was clear and
faintly luminous, carrying in its current the same iridescent organisms
that made up the ground cover.

And at the center of it all, rising above the other structures like
a conductor above an orchestra, was a tower. Not a tower in the human
sense — not a cylinder or a prism, not a stack of floors — but a
spiraling organic form that wound upward from a broad base in a helix
of decreasing radius, its surface alive with color, its peak lost in
the green-gold haze of the canopy far above. It was the most beautiful
thing Kael had ever seen, and he had spent three years on a world of
extravagant beauty.

He opened his journal. His hands were shaking. He began to draw.

                               V.

They came from the gardens.

Not suddenly. Not with drama or threat. They emerged from the spaces
between the structures, rising from the iridescent ground cover as
though they were part of it — which, as Lissande would later determine,
they were. They were tall and slender, their bodies covered in the
same shifting iridescence as the ground and the structures, their
forms roughly humanoid but with a fluidity of proportion that suggested
their shape was a choice rather than a constraint. They had faces —
long, calm, with features that resolved and dissolved like patterns in
water — and they had eyes, large and dark and luminous, that regarded
the survey team with an expression that Kael could only describe as
patient.

There were perhaps forty of them. They stood in a loose semicircle at
the edge of the city, not blocking the path but not welcoming the
visitors forward either. Simply present. Simply watching.

Adama Sylla's hand moved toward his sidearm. Kael put a hand on his
arm.

"Don't," he said.

"Kael—"

"Look at them. They are not afraid of us. They are not surprised.
They expected us."

This was, Kael realized, the truth. The withdrawal of the mist, the
revealed coastline, the open paths, the journey through the forest —
it had all been arranged. The continent had not been discovered. It
had been shown.

One of the beings moved forward. It was slightly taller than the
others, and the patterns on its surface were more complex, shifting
through frequencies of color that Kael's eyes could barely track. It
stopped three meters from Kael and regarded him with those dark,
luminous eyes.

Then it spoke. Not in sound — in scent. A wave of fragrance washed
over the team, complex and structured, carrying in its molecular
composition a meaning that bypassed the ears entirely and arrived
directly in the mind. Kael understood. Not the words — there were no
words — but the meaning.

We know you are here. We have known for a long time.

                               VI.

They were called the Sheth. Or rather, the concept that Kael's mind
translated as "Sheth" was the closest his human cognition could come
to the fragrant, multi-layered self-designation they communicated.
They had been on Ceth IV for approximately forty thousand years. They
had been hiding for thirty-seven thousand of those years.

This information was conveyed over three days, in sessions that Osei
compared to "learning to swim by being gently lowered into increasingly
deep water." The Sheth communicated entirely through biochemical
signals — airborne molecules of extraordinary specificity, each one
carrying packets of meaning that the human olfactory system received
and the human brain interpreted with surprising, if imperfect,
fidelity. Lissande theorized that the Sheth's communication molecules
interacted directly with human neurochemistry, activating existing
associative pathways. Whatever the mechanism, the result was a form
of dialogue that felt less like conversation and more like shared
dreaming.

The being who had approached them first — the tall one, whom Kael came
to think of as the Speaker, though the Sheth had no hierarchies he
could detect — served as their primary interlocutor. On the second day,
in the amber-lit interior of one of the great organic structures, the
Speaker communicated the history of the Sheth on Ceth IV.

They had arrived from elsewhere. The concept of "elsewhere" was
communicated as a vast, dark fragrance laced with longing — a place
very far away, very different, and no longer reachable. They had found
Ceth IV uninhabited and had settled, adapting their civilization to
the planet's ecology, integrating themselves so thoroughly into the
biosphere that they had become, over the millennia, continuous with it.
The forests were theirs. The ground cover was theirs — a living
infrastructure, a sensory network that connected every Sheth individual
to every other and to the planet itself. The city was not built on the
landscape. The city was the landscape. The distinction between
civilization and nature, which humans drew as a line, the Sheth had
dissolved into a gradient.

And then, three thousand years ago, they had detected the first signs.

"Signs of what?" Kael asked, forming the question as clearly as he
could in his mind and allowing the Speaker's biochemical field to
read it.

The answer came as a wave of fragrance so complex and so frightening
that Kael's vision blurred. Darkness. Distance. Something approaching
across inconceivable space, not quickly but inevitably, the way a
glacier approaches, the way a tide approaches, with the patience of a
force that has no reason to hurry because it has no concept of time.

Something is coming.

"What is it?"

The Speaker's surface rippled. The colors shifted through frequencies
that Kael had not seen before — deeper, darker, shot through with
black and a terrible, pulsing red. The fragrance that accompanied the
color was the worst thing Kael had ever smelled — not unpleasant, not
foul, but wrong, a scent that his brain refused to process, that
slid across his consciousness like oil across water, leaving a residue
of dread.

We do not know what it is. We know what it does. It unmakes. It
reaches the places where life has established itself and it unmakes
them. Not destroys — unmakes. As though they had never been. We have
detected the signatures of its passage in the cosmic background
radiation. Civilizations that existed. Worlds that were inhabited.
Gone. Not destroyed. Unmade. The light from those worlds still
travels through space, but the worlds themselves have been removed
from the fabric of what is.

"And it is coming here?"

Not here specifically. Everywhere. It moves through the galaxy in
patterns we have spent three thousand years studying. It will reach
this region of space in approximately — the concept translated to a
number that Kael's mind rendered as — eleven thousand years.

"Eleven thousand years."

Yes.

"And you hid."

Yes. We hid. We concealed our continent, our civilization, our
electromagnetic signature. We reduced our visibility to zero. We
became invisible. We have been invisible for thirty-seven thousand
years, perfecting our concealment, because we know that what is
coming detects life and unmakes it, and our only defense is to not
be seen.

Kael sat in the amber light and felt the weight of this knowledge
settle on him like a physical burden. A civilization of extraordinary
beauty and sophistication, hidden beneath a veil of clouds for
thirty-seven thousand years, because they knew something was coming
that consumed civilizations, and they had decided that survival meant
silence.

"Why did you show yourselves to us?" he asked.

The Speaker's colors shifted to something calmer — blue and green and
gold, the colors of the forest, of life, of continuity. The fragrance
was warm and sad and complicated, carrying in its molecular structure
an emotion that Kael could only describe as responsible love.

Because you are here. Your colony ships are coming. Your people will
settle this world and make it bright with activity, and the brightness
will be seen, eventually, by what is coming. We could have remained
hidden and let you settle the other continents in ignorance. You would
not have found us for centuries, perhaps millennia. We are very good
at hiding.

But that would have been — the concept was fragrant with moral weight
— wrong. You deserve to know what approaches. You deserve the choice
that we made thirty-seven thousand years ago: the choice between being
seen and being safe.

                               VII.

Kael drew the city.

He sat in the garden between the spiraling tower and a structure that
sang faintly in the wind — a dome of translucent membrane that
vibrated like the head of a drum and produced a tone that changed
with the weather. He drew with the obsessive precision of a man who
needed to capture something because he knew it might be lost. Every
curve of every structure. Every gradient of color in the gardens. The
paths, the waterways, the great trees with their hexagonal canopy.

He drew the Sheth themselves — their fluid forms, their shifting
surfaces, their dark and luminous eyes. He drew the Speaker, standing
in the amber light of the meeting chamber, communicating the end of
the world in fragrance.

"You are making a record," the Speaker communicated, standing behind
him and observing the drawings with those dark eyes.

"Yes."

"We understand the impulse. We have records. We have recorded
everything we are, everything we know, everything we have observed.
Our records are stored in the root network beneath the continent — the
substrate. Forty thousand years of memory, encoded in the molecular
structure of living organisms. If we are unmade, the records will
survive longer than we will. Perhaps long enough for someone to find
them."

"You do not expect to survive."

"We expect to try. We have been hiding for thirty-seven thousand years,
and we will continue to hide for eleven thousand more, and if our
concealment holds, we will survive. But we are not certain. What is
coming is very thorough. What is coming has unmade civilizations
far greater than ours."

Kael looked at his drawings. He had been a cartographer for twelve
years, mapping the surfaces of new worlds, converting the unknown into
the known, the wild into the charted. It was work he loved — work that
gave the chaos of the universe a human order, that laid coordinates
over the formless and gave it shape.

But Landmass Seven did not want to be charted. The Sheth had shown
themselves not to be mapped but to deliver a warning. And the warning
was this: the map is not complete. The map will never be complete.
Beyond the edges of every chart, past the last coordinate, past the
farthest reach of human knowledge, something moves in the dark that
makes maps irrelevant.

He closed his journal. He looked at the Speaker.

"I will not publish the chart of this continent," he said. "I will not
include Landmass Seven in the survey. Your secret will remain."

The Speaker's colors shifted to a complex pattern that the fragrance
translated as gratitude mingled with sorrow. Thank you. But you must
tell your people about what is coming. Not about us. About it. They
must know. They must prepare. Eleven thousand years seems long to
species that measure their lives in decades, but it is not long. It is
barely enough.

"How do you prepare for something that unmakes?"

The Speaker was quiet for a time. Then: You hide. Or you run. Or you
find a way to become something that it does not recognize as life.
Those are the only options we have identified in thirty-seven thousand
years of study. We chose to hide. Your species may choose differently.
You are — the fragrance carried a complex emotional note, warm and
curious and faintly amused — very loud. Hiding may not suit you.

Kael almost smiled. "No. Hiding may not suit us."

                               VIII.

They left on the fourth day.

The mist closed behind the skiff as it pulled away from the white sand
beach, the gold curtain drawing shut, concealing the forest and the
city and the Sheth behind a wall of vapor that looked, from a
distance, like any other weather pattern. Within an hour, the continent
was invisible again — a blank space on the chart, an absence where a
presence had been, a silence where a voice had spoken.

Kael stood at the stern and watched the mist until it was
indistinguishable from the horizon. In his leather case, the journal
lay heavy with drawings he would never publish — the most detailed
and beautiful cartographic work of his career, a record of a place
that had chosen to be unknown.

In his mind, the warning lay heavier still. Something approaching
across inconceivable space. Something that unmade. Eleven thousand
years.

He opened the journal to a clean page and wrote the only entry he
would include in the official survey:

     Landmass Seven: Surveyed. Uninhabited. No features of
     significance. Dense cloud cover prevents detailed surface
     mapping. Recommend exclusion from settlement planning
     pending future atmospheric study.

He wrote it in his careful cartographer's hand, and every word was a
lie, and every lie was a gift to a civilization that had trusted him
with the truth.

He closed the journal. The skiff moved on. The sea glittered copper
and gold beneath the twin suns, and the wind carried the scent of
sweetness from the hidden continent, faint and fading and full of
sorrow.

Behind him, in the mist, the Sheth resumed their long, patient
silence, and the blank space on the map remained blank, and the
dragons at the edge of the chart continued their ancient, secret,
desperate vigil against the thing that moved in the dark.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       THE FRONTIER SURGEON

                      by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

The gunshot victim came in on a Thursday, which was the day Dr. Hannah
Voss had been planning to recalibrate the autoclave, which tells you
everything you need to know about life on the frontier.

Bodie's Reach was the last settlement before the boundary, a
collection of forty-two pressurized domes on a rock called Karsten's
World that had no business supporting human life and did so anyway,
out of sheer stubbornness on the part of the three hundred souls who
lived there. The planet had thin air, red dust, brutal temperature
swings, and a sun that set behind a range of mountains so jagged they
looked like broken teeth. Hannah had been the only doctor within fifty
light-years for two years, and in that time she had treated mining
injuries, radiation burns, bar fights, one case of Martian flu that
turned out to be plain old terrestrial influenza with delusions of
grandeur, and a man who had gotten his hand stuck in a rock crusher
and described the experience, with the calm matter-of-factness common
to frontier miners, as "inconvenient."

She was in the clinic when they brought the man in. The clinic was
Dome Sixteen — a converted storage unit that Hannah had equipped with
a surgical table, two recovery cots, a cabinet full of supplies that
were always running low, and a diagnostic scanner that was three
generations out of date and made a sound like a dying cat when you
turned it on. It was not, by any standard, a proper medical facility.
It was what she had.

Two miners carried the man through the airlock, their faces gray with
dust and fear. They set him on the surgical table with the careful
roughness of men who were used to handling heavy things and not used
to handling injured people.

"Found him outside Dome Nine," said the taller one, a man named Greck
whose real name was something Polish and unpronounceable. "Lying in
the dust. Bleeding."

"How long ago?"

"Twenty minutes. Maybe thirty."

Hannah pulled on her gloves and looked at the patient. He was young —
mid-twenties, dark-haired, with the lean build and callused hands of
a hauler. She didn't recognize him, which meant he wasn't local. His
shirt was soaked with blood on the left side, from the ribs down. His
face was the gray-white of significant blood loss. His breathing was
shallow and rapid.

"Name?"

"Don't know. Never seen him before."

"Get out. Both of you. Close the airlock."

They got out. Hannah cut the shirt away with her surgical scissors and
got her first clear look at the wound.

It was a puncture, just below the left ribcage — small entry, no exit.
The bullet was still inside. But the blood around the wound was wrong.
It was darker than it should have been, almost black, and it wasn't
just flowing — it was moving. Creeping. Spreading across the skin in
tendrils that branched and forked like the roots of a plant, tracing
dark lines across the man's abdomen and chest.

"What the hell," Hannah said, which was not a medical assessment but
was accurate nonetheless.

She grabbed the diagnostic scanner and ran it over the wound. The
scanner made its dying-cat noise and produced an image on the cracked
screen. Hannah looked at it. She looked at it again. She wiped the
screen with her sleeve and looked a third time.

The bullet was there — a bright point in the abdominal cavity, lodged
two centimeters below the liver. But it wasn't a bullet. Not any
bullet Hannah had ever seen. It was — she zoomed the image — a
crystalline structure, roughly cylindrical, with a complex internal
lattice that the scanner couldn't fully resolve. And it was growing.

The crystal was extending filaments. Dozens of them, thin as hairs,
radiating outward from the central mass into the surrounding tissue.
Some of the filaments had reached the blood vessels and were following
them, threading through the circulatory system like vines climbing a
trellis. Others had penetrated the muscle tissue and were branching
into the intercostal spaces. Two filaments had reached the liver.

Hannah watched the scan for ten seconds. In those ten seconds, the
filaments grew measurably. She could see them extending, pushing
through tissue with a slow, deliberate precision that was more
disturbing than any infection she had ever encountered. This wasn't
biological. It was mechanical. The bullet — the crystal — was
restructuring its host from the inside out.

She had to get it out. Now.

                               II.

The problem was that "getting it out" was a phrase that assumed a
conventional situation, and this situation had left conventional behind
about five minutes ago.

Hannah inventoried her resources. Surgical table: functional. Surgical
instruments: adequate for basic procedures, inadequate for anything
that required precision below a millimeter. Anesthesia: a local
injectable that would numb the area around the wound. General
anesthesia was not an option — the equipment for it was on Hannah's
wishlist, which was a document of such length and pathos that she had
once considered submitting it to a literary magazine. Blood supply:
four units of synthetic, universal type, stored in the cooler behind
the recovery cots. Diagnostic imaging: one scanner, three generations
old, dying-cat-noise model. Antibiotics, clamps, sutures, retractors,
scalpels — all present, all functional, all designed for human anatomy
dealing with human problems.

None of them were designed for a bullet that was alive.

She gave the patient the local anesthetic. She set up an IV line with
the synthetic blood. She cleaned the wound area, which was complicated
by the dark tendrils, which did not respond to antiseptic and which
had a disconcerting tendency to move away from the swab, as though
they were aware of it.

She picked up a scalpel and made the incision.

The tissue parted cleanly — the patient's flesh, at least, was still
normal flesh. She used a retractor to widen the opening and got her
first direct look at the crystal.

It was beautiful. That was the wrong thing to think, but Hannah had
been a surgeon for fifteen years and she had never lost the capacity
to be struck by the visual qualities of the things she found inside
the human body. The crystal was the deep blue of a sapphire, about
two centimeters long and half a centimeter wide, and its surface was
covered in a pattern of facets so fine and regular that they caught
the surgical light and threw it back in tiny, precise rainbows. The
filaments emerged from its surface like roots from a seed — pale,
translucent, branching, and visibly growing as Hannah watched.

She reached in with a pair of forceps and grasped the crystal.

The patient screamed.

Not the scream of a man in pain — the local should have prevented that.
A different scream. A scream of — Hannah could not identify it for a
moment, and then she could. Connection. The scream of something being
disconnected. As though the crystal and the man had already begun to
merge, and separating them was an act of violence not against the body
but against something deeper.

The crystal pulsed in the forceps. The filaments contracted, pulling
taut against the surrounding tissue, and Hannah saw with cold clarity
that the filaments had already begun to integrate with the tissue on a
cellular level. They were not just threading through the body. They
were becoming part of it. The cells around each filament were changing
— their structure altered, their organization shifting from the
standard architecture of human muscle and organ tissue to something
else, something that incorporated the crystal's lattice pattern.

If she pulled the crystal out now, she would tear the filaments free,
and the filaments would tear the tissue with them. The resulting
internal damage would be catastrophic.

She released the forceps. The patient stopped screaming.

Hannah stood at the table, her gloved hands trembling slightly, and
thought very fast.

                               III.

She couldn't remove the crystal. Not by pulling it out. The filaments
were too integrated, too numerous, too deeply embedded. Pulling the
crystal would be like pulling a tree out by the roots — the roots would
take the soil with them.

But she could not leave it in. The filaments were still growing. The
scan showed them advancing through the patient's body at a rate of
approximately one centimeter per hour. At that rate, they would reach
the heart in — she calculated — six hours. The brain in ten. She did
not know what would happen when the filaments reached those organs, but
she had a strong suspicion that it would not be anything she wanted to
witness.

She needed a third option.

Hannah Voss had not gone to a fancy medical school. She had gone to
a state university on a scholarship, done her residency at a county
hospital in a part of the Midwest that most people drove through
without stopping, and spent the first five years of her career
treating farm injuries and bar fights in small towns where the nearest
specialist was two hours away. She had learned, out of necessity, to
improvise. To use what she had. To look at a problem and see not the
tools she wished she had but the tools she did have, and to find a
way to make them work.

She looked at the crystal. She looked at the filaments. She looked at
the diagnostic scanner.

The filaments followed the blood vessels. They used the circulatory
system as a pathway, the way ivy used a wall. If she could block the
pathway — not all of the pathways, but the critical ones, the ones
leading to the heart and brain — she could slow the crystal's
expansion and buy time.

She had clamps. Surgical clamps, designed for clamping blood vessels
during surgery. If she clamped the major vessels leading from the wound
site to the heart and brain, the filaments would lose their pathway.
They might continue to grow through the tissue, but tissue growth was
slower than vascular growth. She would gain time.

It was a terrible idea. Clamping major blood vessels would reduce blood
flow to critical organs. The patient would be at risk of stroke,
cardiac arrest, and organ failure. It was the kind of idea that would
get a surgeon's license revoked on any civilized world.

It was also the only idea she had.

She picked up the clamps. She opened the incision wider. She located
the left hepatic artery, the splenic artery, and the left renal artery
— the three major vessels closest to the crystal that led toward the
heart. She clamped them, one by one, with steady hands and a steady
voice that said, to the unconscious patient, "I know this is insane.
Trust me."

Then she clamped the intercostal veins that the filaments had already
reached, cutting off their route to the superior vena cava.

The effect was immediate. On the scanner, she could see the filaments
encountering the clamps — reaching the clamped vessels, probing
forward, finding the passage blocked. They paused. They probed again.
Then they began to redirect, seeking alternative pathways through the
tissue.

But the tissue pathways were slower. Hannah had bought time. Not much
— hours, not days — but enough to think.

She stood at the table and thought. The crystal was alien. The
filaments were alien. They were doing something to the patient's body
— restructuring it, converting it, turning human tissue into something
that incorporated the crystal's pattern. She did not know why. She did
not know what the end result would be. But she knew that the process
was systematic, deliberate, and — she had the unnerving sense —
purposeful.

What if she couldn't stop the crystal? What if the filaments could
not be removed, could not be blocked, could not be defeated? What if
the only option was to direct them?

The thought was insane. But it was a specific kind of insane — the
kind that frontier surgeons arrived at when all the sane options had
been exhausted.

                               IV.

The airlock buzzer sounded at 1400 hours.

Hannah was in the middle of repositioning a clamp when the buzzer
went off — a harsh, flat tone that meant someone was cycling through
the outer door. She hadn't been expecting anyone. The clinic was not
a drop-in facility.

She ignored it. The clamp was more important.

The buzzer sounded again. Then a voice, amplified by the airlock
speaker: "Doctor. Open the door."

It was not a voice she recognized. It was male, flat, and carried the
particular calm of someone who was used to giving orders and did not
expect to repeat them.

"Clinic is closed," Hannah said, without looking up. "Emergency in
progress."

"We know. Open the door. We're here for the patient."

Hannah's hands went still on the clamp. She looked at the airlock.
Through the small viewport, she could see two figures in environment
suits — not mining suits, not the patched-together rigs the locals
wore, but sleek, professional-grade suits in matte black. One of
them was holding something that, even through the thick glass, was
unmistakably a weapon.

She looked at the patient on the table. Unconscious, pale, with a
crystal in his gut that was slowly turning him into something else.
She looked at the dark tendrils on his skin, the clamps on his
vessels, the improvised surgical field that was the only thing between
this man and whatever the crystal intended to do with him.

"I have a patient in surgery," she said. "I am not opening this door."

"Doctor, that man is carrying stolen property. The item in his body is
not a weapon. It is a device of considerable value, and the people I
work for want it back. You can give us the man, or we can take him.
Those are the options."

"There is a third option. You can leave."

A pause. Then the voice again, still calm, still flat: "We're going
to cut through the airlock."

"That will take you twenty minutes. In twenty minutes, I can have the
Settlement Marshal here with every armed miner in Bodie's Reach."

"The Settlement Marshal is currently occupied. We made sure of that
before we came."

Hannah felt the cold settle in her stomach — the particular cold of
realizing that the situation was worse than she had thought. She
looked at the patient. She looked at the airlock. She looked at her
surgical instruments, which were designed for cutting flesh, not
fighting criminals.

She picked up the heaviest thing within reach — a metal instrument
tray, about forty centimeters wide and solid enough to serve as a
weapon, or at least as a distraction. She set it beside the surgical
table, within reach.

Then she went back to work.

                               V.

If she could not remove the crystal, and she could not stop the
filaments, and she could not hand the patient over to the men outside,
then she had to accelerate the process and control it.

The idea crystallized — she noted the irony — while she was studying
the scanner readouts. The filaments were not random. They had a
pattern. They were converting tissue in a specific sequence, working
outward from the crystal in concentric shells, transforming muscle and
organ tissue into something that incorporated the crystal's lattice
structure. The transformation was systematic. It was orderly. It was,
in its terrible way, surgical.

What if the crystal was not a weapon? What if it was a medical device?
An alien medical device, designed to repair, restructure, or enhance
a body — not a human body, necessarily, but a body. And what if the
violent reaction — the dark tendrils, the pain, the screaming — was
not a malfunction but a compatibility problem? The crystal was
designed for an alien physiology. It was trying to do its job in a
body it did not understand.

If she could guide it — redirect the filaments away from critical
organs, steer the transformation toward non-essential tissue, give
the crystal a framework it could work with instead of against — she
might be able to save the patient.

She needed the crystal to understand the body it was in. She needed
to give it information.

Hannah looked at the diagnostic scanner. It emitted a low-frequency
electromagnetic pulse to generate its images. The crystal was
responsive to electromagnetic stimulation — she had seen its filaments
react to the scanner's pulse, orienting toward the signal the way a
plant orients toward light.

What if she used the scanner not to image the body but to communicate
with the crystal?

She adjusted the scanner's settings. She reduced the imaging frequency
and increased the pulse duration, transforming the diagnostic signal
into something closer to a continuous wave. She positioned the scanner
directly over the wound, aiming the modified signal at the crystal.

The crystal responded. On the scanner's screen, Hannah could see the
filaments — which had been spreading in all directions — begin to
consolidate. They drew together, organizing themselves along the
scanner's signal path. They were listening.

She adjusted the frequency. Higher. Lower. She watched the filaments
respond, changing their growth pattern with each frequency shift. It
was like — she groped for the analogy — like tuning a radio. Like
finding the right station.

She found it.

At 4.7 megahertz, the crystal's filaments stopped growing. They did
not retract — the damage was done, the tissue was changed — but they
stopped advancing. The crystal pulsed once, twice, and then settled
into a rhythm that matched the patient's heartbeat.

Hannah held the scanner steady. Her arms ached. Her back ached. The
men outside were cutting through the airlock — she could hear the whine
of the cutting tool, high and thin, like a dentist's drill amplified
a thousandfold. She had, by her estimate, fifteen minutes.

She adjusted the frequency again, very slightly, and watched the
filaments respond. She was talking to the crystal. She did not speak
its language. But she was learning.

Over the next ten minutes, she guided the filaments. She could not
retract them, but she could redirect them — pulling them away from
the liver, steering them into the abdominal muscle wall, where they
could grow without threatening anything vital. The crystal cooperated.
Or rather, the crystal responded to the scanner's signal with a
consistency that suggested cooperation, that suggested something like
understanding, that suggested that the device — for it was a device,
Hannah was now certain — had recognized her as an operator and was
following her instructions.

The patient's vitals stabilized. His color improved. The dark tendrils
on his skin stopped spreading and began, very slowly, to fade.

The airlock gave way.

                               VI.

The two men came through the inner door with weapons drawn. They were
professionals — smooth, fast, and focused. The one in front scanned
the room and fixed on Hannah. The one behind scanned the room and
fixed on the patient.

"Step away from the table, Doctor."

Hannah did not step away from the table. She stood where she was,
holding the scanner over the patient, and said: "If you move him, he
dies. The crystal is integrated with his cardiovascular system. If you
disrupt the signal I am maintaining, the filaments will resume
uncontrolled growth. He will be dead in two hours, and your device
will be embedded in a corpse."

The lead man looked at her. He had the face of a man who evaluated
situations for a living and was evaluating this one now.

"You're bluffing."

"I am a surgeon. I do not bluff. I diagnose. And my diagnosis is that
this man cannot be moved without killing him, and if he dies, your
crystal goes with him. You are welcome to test this assessment. But I
should warn you that I have been practicing medicine on the frontier
for two years, and I have had patients die on my table from injuries
far less exotic than this one, and I know exactly what a dead body
looks like. So do you, I suspect. Neither of us wants to add to the
collection."

A pause. The lead man's weapon did not waver.

"How long until he's stable enough to move?"

"Seventy-two hours. Minimum."

"We don't have seventy-two hours."

"Then you have a problem. But it is not a problem I can solve by
hurrying. Surgery does not hurry. Surgery takes exactly as long as it
takes."

The two men looked at each other. Some communication passed between
them — a glance, a micro-expression, the shorthand of people who
worked together under pressure.

"Forty-eight hours," the lead man said. "We stay. You work. If he's
alive and stable in forty-eight hours, we take him and the crystal
and you never see us again."

"And if he's not?"

"Then we take the crystal anyway, and you deal with the consequences."

Hannah looked at the lead man. She looked at his weapon. She looked
at the patient on the table, whose heartbeat had synchronized with
the crystal's pulse, whose body was being slowly, carefully, partially
remade by an alien device that Hannah was learning to operate with a
repurposed diagnostic scanner.

"Forty-eight hours," she said. "Stay out of my way."

She went back to work.

                               VII.

She worked through the night and into the next day.

The crystal was responsive. The more she communicated with it — crude,
frequency-based communication, like tapping Morse code on a pipe —
the more it cooperated. She guided the filaments into stable
configurations, routing them through muscle tissue and subcutaneous
fat, away from organs and major vessels. She released the clamps on
the blood vessels one by one, watching the scanner for any sign of
renewed growth toward critical areas. The filaments stayed where she
put them.

The patient woke up once, at about three in the morning. His eyes
opened and he looked at Hannah with the confused, raw expression of
someone surfacing from deep water.

"Where—"

"Bodie's Reach. The clinic. You've been shot."

"The crystal. Is it—"

"Still in you. I'm managing it. Don't move."

He closed his eyes. Then he opened them again. "They'll come for it."

"They're here. Two of them. They're in the waiting room, eating my
emergency rations and looking unfriendly."

"You have to — " He tried to sit up. Hannah put a hand on his chest
and pushed him back down.

"I have to keep you alive. That is the only thing I have to do.
Everything else is secondary. Now lie still and let me work."

He lay still. After a moment, he said: "My name is Dak. Dak Rennick."

"Hannah Voss. Nice to meet you, Dak. Try not to bleed on my table."

He almost smiled. Then he closed his eyes, and his breathing
steadied, and Hannah went back to the scanner.

By the forty-hour mark, the crystal had stabilized. Its filaments had
integrated with the patient's musculature in a pattern that the
scanner showed as a latticework of fine lines, lacing through the
abdominal wall and the intercostal muscles like a second skeleton.
The conversion was not complete — most of the body remained
unmodified — but in the regions where the crystal had taken hold, the
tissue was changed. Stronger. Denser. Threaded with a structure that
was neither fully human nor fully alien, but something new.

Hannah ran every test she could run with her aging equipment. Heart
function: normal. Liver function: normal. Kidney function: normal.
Neurological responses: normal. The crystal had been redirected, its
transformation contained, its integration stabilized. The patient
was alive, conscious, and — as far as she could determine — healthy.

He was also, in the region of the crystal's influence, something other
than entirely human.

"What will happen to him?" she asked herself, staring at the scanner.
She did not have an answer. Nobody had an answer. This was the frontier.
There were no specialists, no research hospitals, no experts on alien
surgical devices. There was only Hannah Voss and her dying-cat scanner
and her two years of making do.

The lead man appeared at the forty-six hour mark. "Time's up."

"He's stable."

"Can he walk?"

"He can walk. He should not walk far."

"He won't need to. We have a ship."

The lead man and his partner lifted Dak Rennick from the table. Dak
was conscious, pale, shaky on his feet. He looked at Hannah as they
moved him toward the airlock.

"Thank you, Doctor."

"Come back if you start growing crystals out of your ears. I'll add
it to my list of things I've treated."

He almost smiled again. Then they took him through the airlock, and
the outer door sealed behind them, and Hannah was alone in the clinic
with a blood-stained surgical table and the lingering electromagnetic
signature of an alien crystal that she had learned to operate in a
single night.

She sat down in the chair beside the recovery cot. Her hands were
steady. Her hands were always steady — it was the rest of her that
shook, after, when the surgery was done and the patient was gone and
the adrenaline had nowhere left to go.

She sat and she shook, and after a while she stopped shaking, and she
stood up, and she cleaned the table, and she recalibrated the
autoclave, because it was Thursday, and Thursday was autoclave day,
and the frontier did not stop for alien crystals or gunshot victims
or anything else.

There would be another patient tomorrow. There was always another
patient tomorrow.

Hannah Voss washed her hands and got back to work.

================================================================================

                        THE LAST FREQUENCY

                          by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                               I.

I will set down the facts as clearly as I can, though I am aware that
clarity is a quality my account may lack in its later passages. The
facts themselves are clear. It is my capacity to report them that
deteriorated as the experiment progressed, and I cannot say, even now,
whether the deterioration was a failure of my instrument or my mind or
the distinction between the two.

My name is Elise Moreau. I was, until recently, an associate professor
of experimental physics at the University of Leiden. I use the past
tense advisedly. The university has placed me on indefinite medical
leave, a decision I did not contest and which may, for reasons that
will become apparent, be the most reasonable thing any institution has
ever done on my behalf.

The experiment began as a question about the electromagnetic spectrum.

This requires some explanation for the lay reader, and I will attempt
to provide it without condescension. The electromagnetic spectrum is
the range of all possible frequencies of electromagnetic radiation —
from the very long wavelengths of radio waves to the very short
wavelengths of gamma rays, with visible light, infrared, ultraviolet,
and X-rays occupying the territory between. It is a continuum, and in
theory, it has no edges. The spectrum extends infinitely in both
directions — toward wavelengths so long they would span galaxies, and
toward wavelengths so short they would fit between the components of
an atomic nucleus.

In practice, however, the spectrum has functional boundaries. Below a
certain frequency, the wavelength exceeds the observable universe and
becomes meaningless. Above a certain frequency — the Planck frequency,
approximately 10^43 hertz — the energy of a single photon exceeds
the Planck energy, and our physics ceases to apply. Beyond the Planck
frequency lies a realm that our theories cannot describe, and that no
instrument has ever probed.

I became interested in this boundary. Not in the physics of it, which
had been thoroughly discussed in the theoretical literature, but in
the question of what happened at the boundary. What was there? Was the
boundary a wall — a hard limit beyond which electromagnetic radiation
simply could not exist? Or was it a transition — a zone where the
radiation changed character, passed into a different regime, became
something that our instruments were not designed to detect?

I asked this question in a seminar in the autumn of 1952, and the
response was the polite, discouraging silence that academics reserve
for colleagues who have strayed beyond the bounds of respectability.
The Planck frequency was a theoretical limit. It was not an
experimental question. No instrument could operate at those energies.
The question was, in the terminology of my department, "non-physical."

I accepted this assessment. For a time. Then I found the Kuznetsov
paper.

                               II.

Andrei Kuznetsov was a Soviet physicist who had published, in 1949,
a paper in an obscure journal of the Moscow Physical Society that I
discovered by accident while searching for something else entirely.
The paper was in Russian, which I read poorly, and it was badly
typeset, and its title was unpromising: "On the Theoretical
Construction of Receivers for Radiation Beyond the Planck Threshold."

I almost passed it by. I did not.

Kuznetsov's argument was elegant and, when I had worked through it
with the aid of a dictionary and a great deal of patience, terrifying.
He proposed that the Planck frequency was not a wall but a horizon.
Beyond it, electromagnetic radiation continued to exist, but in a
form that required a receiver of fundamentally different construction.
The receiver could not be made of ordinary matter — the energy
densities involved would destroy any conventional material. It had to
be made of something that existed at the boundary between matter and
energy, between particle and wave, between the physics we understood
and the physics we did not.

Kuznetsov proposed a specific design. The receiver would consist of a
crystalline lattice of degenerate neutron matter — the material found
in the cores of neutron stars — suspended in a magnetic confinement
field of extraordinary intensity. The crystal would resonate with
radiation at and beyond the Planck frequency, converting it into
lower-frequency signals that could be detected by conventional
instruments.

The design was, of course, impossible. Degenerate neutron matter could
not be produced in a laboratory. It existed only in the hearts of
collapsed stars, under pressures that no terrestrial technology could
replicate.

And yet — and this was the part that kept me awake at night, that
followed me through my days like a shadow, that made me return to
the paper again and again with the compulsive attention of someone
prodding a wound — Kuznetsov had included, in an appendix that seemed
almost an afterthought, a set of equations describing an alternative.
Not neutron matter, but a synthetic analogue. A crystalline structure
that could be grown, atom by atom, using a process of directed
molecular assembly that Kuznetsov described in mathematical terms that
I spent three months decoding.

The process required materials that did not exist in 1949. But in 1953,
they did. The development of programmable molecular assemblers — crude,
first-generation devices, barely capable of constructing simple
crystalline structures — had made Kuznetsov's alternative marginally
possible. Not easy. Not practical. But possible.

I wrote to Moscow. My letter was returned, stamped with an official
notice that Dr. Kuznetsov was "no longer available for correspondence."
I did not pursue the inquiry. The phrasing was sufficiently clear.

I built the receiver myself.

                               III.

It took me eleven months.

I worked alone, in the basement laboratory of the physics building,
which I had access to because no one else wanted it. The basement was
damp, poorly lit, and infested with a species of European house spider
that built elaborate webs in the corners and regarded my presence with
what I interpreted as disdainful tolerance. The spiders became, over
the months, a kind of company. I named them. The largest, a female of
impressive span who occupied the web nearest my workbench, I called
Madame Kuznetsov.

The construction of the receiver was the most difficult thing I have
ever done. The crystalline lattice had to be assembled atom by atom,
using the university's molecular assembler — a device the size of a
refrigerator that hummed constantly and required daily recalibration.
Each crystal took three weeks to grow. Most of them failed. The
lattice structure was finicky, intolerant of the slightest impurity
or deviation in the growth parameters. I grew forty-seven crystals.
Six survived. Of those six, three met Kuznetsov's specifications.

I mounted the three crystals in a magnetic confinement housing that
I constructed from repurposed equipment — superconducting magnets
salvaged from a decommissioned particle detector, a vacuum chamber
borrowed from the chemistry department under false pretenses, and a
signal processing unit that I built from components ordered from
fourteen different suppliers in seven countries, because no single
supplier carried all of them, and because I did not want anyone to
know what I was building.

I did not want anyone to know because I was not certain that what I
was building should be built. This doubt accompanied me through the
entire construction process like a low fever — present, persistent,
and insufficient to stop me. I am a physicist. The question of what
lies beyond the boundary of the known is not, for me, a theoretical
abstraction. It is an itch. It is a compulsion. It is the thing that
gets me out of bed in the morning and keeps me in the laboratory long
after everyone else has gone home. I could no more have stopped
building the receiver than I could have stopped breathing.

The doubt remained. But I built it anyway.

                               IV.

I turned on the receiver on a Tuesday evening in March.

It was raining. I mention this because the sound of the rain on the
basement window — a small, ground-level window that looked out onto
a courtyard where students smoked between lectures — became important
later, as a reference point. A touchstone. A sound that I could fix
my attention on when other sounds became difficult to bear.

The receiver hummed to life. The superconducting magnets engaged. The
vacuum chamber reached operating pressure. The crystals, suspended in
their magnetic cradle, began to vibrate at a frequency that my
monitoring instruments could detect but that lay, I knew, far below
the crystals' true resonant frequency — the frequency at which they
would receive, if Kuznetsov was right, radiation from beyond the
Planck threshold.

I adjusted the tuning. The crystals' vibration increased. My
monitoring instruments tracked the signal, which was — at this stage
— nothing. Background noise. The cosmic hiss that pervades all
electromagnetic measurements, the echo of the universe's thermal
history.

I increased the tuning. The crystals vibrated faster. The magnetic
confinement field strained — I could hear the magnets groaning, a
deep, structural sound, like the hull of a ship under pressure. The
signal on my instruments remained noise.

I increased the tuning further. I was approaching the boundary now —
the theoretical threshold where conventional electromagnetic radiation
gave way to — whatever lay beyond. The crystals were vibrating at a
frequency that my instruments could no longer directly measure. I was
inferring their state from the secondary harmonics, the way you might
infer the presence of a very high-pitched sound from the vibration of
a glass on the table.

The harmonics shifted. Something changed. The noise on my instruments
acquired a structure — faint, barely perceptible, but present. A
pattern in the static. A regularity in the random.

I increased the tuning one more increment.

The receiver screamed.

I do not mean that it produced a loud noise. I mean that the signal
that emerged from the crystals, converted to audio frequencies by the
processing unit and fed through the laboratory's speaker system, was a
sound that my mind interpreted — immediately, involuntarily, with a
certainty that bypassed all rational evaluation — as a scream. Not a
human scream. Not an animal scream. Something older. Something that
had been screaming for a very long time.

I reached for the power switch. I did not turn it off.

I sat in my chair in the damp basement, with the rain on the window
and Madame Kuznetsov watching from her web, and I listened.

                               V.

The scream was not a scream.

I understood this after approximately ninety seconds, during which my
heart rate was elevated, my palms were sweating, and my rational mind
was engaged in a vigorous argument with my limbic system about whether
the appropriate response was to listen or to run. The rational mind
won, narrowly, and I began to analyze the signal with the
methodological training that eleven years of physics had provided.

The signal was structured. It had a carrier frequency — the
fundamental tone, the "scream" — and superimposed on that carrier were
modulations. Variations in amplitude, frequency, and phase that
followed patterns too regular to be natural, too complex to be simple,
and too persistent to be artifacts of the equipment.

It was a broadcast.

I adjusted the processing unit to filter the carrier and isolate the
modulations. The scream faded. What remained was — I struggle for the
word — a voice. Not a voice in the human sense. Not a voice that
carried language or meaning in any form I could recognize. But a
structured, intentional signal that varied over time in ways that
conveyed information. A voice the way a heartbeat is a voice. A voice
the way the tides are a voice. Something that spoke, if "spoke" was
the word, in a language that predated language by an unimaginable span.

I recorded the signal. I ran it through every analytical tool at my
disposal — Fourier transforms, spectral analysis, pattern recognition
algorithms, statistical tests for non-random structure. Every tool
confirmed what my ears had already told me: the signal was not noise.
It was not natural. It was a message.

A message from beyond the Planck frequency. From a regime of physics
that our theories could not describe. From a place — if "place" was
the word — that existed beyond the boundary of the electromagnetic
spectrum, beyond the boundary of the known universe, beyond the
boundary of everything.

I sat in the basement and listened, and the rain fell on the window,
and Madame Kuznetsov sat motionless in her web, and the signal from
beyond the boundary of everything poured through my speakers in a
stream of modulated frequency that I could not understand but could
not stop listening to.

I listened for six hours. Then I turned off the receiver and went
upstairs. It was four in the morning. The rain had stopped. The campus
was empty. I walked home through streets that looked the same as they
had always looked but felt different — thinner, less substantial, as
though the world I walked through was a screen behind which something
else, something immeasurably older and more real, was dimly visible.

I went to bed. I did not sleep.

                               VI.

I returned to the basement the next evening, and the evening after
that, and every evening for the next three weeks. I told no one. I
told myself that I was gathering data, that I needed to accumulate a
sufficient body of recordings before I could make any claims, that
caution and thoroughness were the appropriate responses to a
discovery of this magnitude.

These were true things. They were also not the real reason I told no
one. The real reason was that I was afraid. Not of the signal — or not
only of the signal — but of what would happen when the signal became
known. I was afraid of the questions that would follow. I was afraid
of the answers that would not. I was afraid that the signal, once
heard by others, would change things in ways that could not be
unchanged, and that I, having built the receiver and turned it on,
would bear a responsibility that I was not equipped to carry.

And so I listened alone.

Over those three weeks, the signal evolved. Or rather, my
understanding of the signal evolved — I cannot be certain which. The
modulations became, to my ears, more complex. The patterns shifted.
New structures emerged in the data — long-period variations that
repeated over cycles of hours, nested within shorter-period variations
that repeated over cycles of minutes, nested within still shorter
variations that pulsed at the edge of perception. The signal was
layered, recursive, self-similar. It was, I realized with a chill
that I felt in my bones, fractal.

And then, on the seventeenth evening, the signal changed.

It changed in a way that was different from the gradual evolution I had
been tracking. It changed suddenly, completely, as though whatever was
producing it had become aware that it was being heard. The modulations
simplified. The layered, fractal complexity collapsed into a single,
clear, repeating pattern.

I stared at the waveform on my oscilloscope. The pattern repeated.
And repeated. And repeated. Simple, insistent, unmistakable.

It was a greeting.

I sat very still in my chair. The rain was falling again — I could
hear it on the window, the same sound it had always made, but now it
sounded thin, provisional, like a sound effect in a play. The
receiver hummed. The crystals vibrated. And the signal repeated its
greeting, patient and clear.

I did something then that I cannot explain in rational terms. I
adjusted the receiver's confinement field — not to receive, but to
transmit. The crystals could be made to vibrate at a frequency that
would propagate through the receiver's magnetic field and, in theory,
radiate outward in the same frequency regime from which the signal
originated. I was not certain it would work. I was not certain of
anything.

I tapped the confinement field control. A brief pulse. A simple
pattern. A reply.

The signal stopped.

For thirty seconds — the longest thirty seconds of my life — there
was silence. Complete silence. Not even the background noise. As though
the universe itself had paused to consider what had just happened.

Then the signal returned. And it was different.

It was no longer a greeting. It was no longer a broadcast. It was a
conversation. The modulations had changed character entirely — they
were responsive now, adaptive, adjusting to my pulse the way a
conversation adjusts to its interlocutor. The signal was talking to
me. And I — God help me — was talking back.

                               VII.

I cannot describe the conversation in terms that will satisfy a
physicist or, for that matter, anyone who requires precision of
language. The signal did not communicate in words. It did not
communicate in mathematics, or in images, or in any symbolic system
I have been trained to recognize. It communicated in — the best term
I can offer is impressions. States. Conditions. As though the signal
were not transmitting information about something but transmitting
the something itself — raw, unmediated, without the translation layer
that language provides.

I received these impressions not through my ears — the audio output
was secondary, a crude translation of something far more fundamental
— but through the crystals. The crystals were resonating with the
signal at a level that my instruments could track but not fully
capture, and the resonance was affecting me. I could feel it. A
vibration in my awareness. A loosening of the boundaries that normally
separated my mind from the world outside it.

What I received — what I understood, or what I believe I understood,
with the full caveat that my understanding may have been distorted by
the signal's effect on my cognition — was this:

The signal was old. Not old in the sense that a mountain is old, or
a star is old, or even the universe is old. The signal was old in a
sense that predated these categories of age. It came from before. Not
from before the beginning of the universe in the way that a previous
Tuesday comes before a current Wednesday. From before in a more
fundamental sense — before the existence of time itself, before the
framework within which "before" and "after" have meaning.

The signal was a remnant. A trace. An echo of something that had
existed prior to the Big Bang — prior to the expansion of spacetime
from its initial singularity, prior to the emergence of the physical
laws that govern our universe, prior to the universe itself. Whatever
had existed in that prior state — the state that physicists call,
with studied vagueness, "the initial conditions" — had left a mark.
The mark was the signal. It had been broadcasting since before the
beginning of time, on a frequency that no receiver within the universe
could detect, because the frequency itself belonged to the prior state,
not to the current one.

Until Kuznetsov had described how to build a receiver that straddled
the boundary. Until I had built it.

And the signal — the voice, the presence, the whatever-it-was that
existed on the other side of the Planck frequency, on the other side
of the boundary of everything — had been waiting. Waiting for the
receiver. Waiting for the reply. Waiting, with a patience that was
not patience because patience implies the experience of duration, and
this thing existed outside of duration, outside of time, outside of
the framework within which waiting and patience have meaning.

It had been waiting, and now it was speaking, and what it was saying —
what the impression conveyed, translated through the crystals and the
resonance and my trembling, inadequate human mind — was a warning.

                               VIII.

The warning was simple.

This was the most disturbing thing about it. I had expected — if
"expected" is the right word for the state of a mind receiving
transmissions from beyond the beginning of time — complexity.
Profundity. A revelation so vast and intricate that it would take
years to decode, like a mathematical proof of infinite length.

Instead, the warning was simple. It was, in the crude translation
that my mind imposed on the impression it received, approximately
this:

The universe is a structure. It was built. Not by a being — the
impression carried no sense of personhood, of intention in the human
sense — but by a process. A process that existed before the universe
and that initiated the universe and that continues to operate within
the universe, embedded in its physical laws, running beneath the
surface of reality like a current beneath ice. The process has a
direction. It is moving toward something. And when it reaches that
something — when the structure that is the universe arrives at the
state that the process is driving it toward — the structure will be
complete. And what happens to a structure when it is complete is
what has happened to every structure that the process has built, in
every iteration, in every cycle, since before the concept of "since"
had meaning.

It ends.

Not in collapse. Not in heat death. Not in any of the eschatological
scenarios that cosmology has proposed. It ends the way a calculation
ends — by producing a result. The universe is a calculation, and
when the calculation is finished, the universe will be finished, and
whatever comes after — whatever the result is used for, by whatever
lies on the other side of the boundary — will begin.

And the warning — the purpose of the signal, the reason the voice from
before the beginning had been broadcasting for fourteen billion years
on a frequency that nothing within the universe should have been able
to hear — was this:

The calculation is almost finished.

Not in human terms. Not in years or centuries or millennia. In
cosmological terms. The process that drives the universe toward its
completion is accelerating. The remaining duration — the time between
now and the end of the calculation — is finite, and it is shorter
than anyone within the universe has estimated, because no one within
the universe has known that the universe is a calculation, and no one
has known what the calculation is for.

I do not know what the calculation is for. The impression did not
convey this. It conveyed only the fact of the calculation, the fact
of its approaching completion, and the fact that the signal — the
voice — was warning me. Warning anyone who could hear. Warning the
inhabitants of the structure that the structure was nearing completion,
with the same impersonal urgency with which an alarm sounds before a
building is demolished.

Not because the inhabitants can stop the demolition. But because they
deserve to know.

                               IX.

I turned off the receiver.

I sat in the basement for a long time. The rain had stopped. The
silence was total — not the loaded silence of the signal's pauses, but
ordinary silence, the silence of a room in which nothing extraordinary
was happening. Madame Kuznetsov was motionless in her web, her eight
legs drawn in, her body still. She did not know. The spiders did not
know. The students sleeping in the dormitories above me did not know.
The people of Leiden, of the Netherlands, of Europe, of Earth did
not know. No one knew except me, and I sat in the basement with my
receiver and my crystals and the knowledge that the universe was a
calculation nearing its completion, and I did not know what to do.

I considered the options.

I could publish. Write a paper, submit it to a journal, present the
data, invite replication. This was the responsible thing. The
scientific thing. But I knew — with the instinct of someone who has
spent a career in academia — what would happen. The paper would be
rejected. The claims were too extraordinary, the data too anomalous,
the implications too disturbing. I would be dismissed as a crank.
And even if I were not — even if someone replicated the experiment,
built another receiver, heard the signal — what then? The warning
could not be acted upon. The calculation could not be stopped. The
knowledge would produce only fear.

I could destroy the receiver. Smash the crystals, dismantle the
magnets, erase the recordings. Pretend it had never happened. Go back
to my lectures, my seminars, my ordinary life. This was the cowardly
thing, and possibly the kind thing.

I could listen again. Go back to the boundary, tune the crystals,
open the channel, and ask the voice from before the beginning: how
long? How long do we have? Is there anything we can do? Is there any
way to stop the calculation, or slow it, or change its result?

I knew the answer. The impression had been clear. The voice was not
offering hope. It was offering knowledge. The two are not the same
thing, and in this case, they are nearly opposites.

I sat in the basement until dawn. Then I stood up. I disconnected the
receiver. I removed the crystals from their magnetic cradle and placed
them in a lead-lined box that I locked and stored in the bottom drawer
of the filing cabinet. I covered the receiver with a cloth, the way
one covers a mirror in a house of mourning. I turned off the lights
and went upstairs.

The morning was clear. The rain had washed the courtyard clean, and
the cobblestones were shining in the early light. A student passed me
on the path, carrying books, headphones around her neck, moving
through the world with the unselfconscious purpose of someone who
believed — who had every reason to believe — that the world would be
here tomorrow, and the day after that, and for as long as she needed
it.

I did not tell her. I did not tell anyone.

I went home. I sat in my kitchen and drank coffee and looked out the
window at the street, where the day was beginning and people were
walking and cars were passing and a dog was barking at something only
it could see. The world was ordinary and beautiful and temporary, and
I was the only person in it who knew how temporary, and the knowledge
sat in me like a stone in still water, and I did not know what to do
with it.

I still do not know.

I am writing this account because the alternative — carrying this
knowledge alone for the rest of my life — is worse than sharing it.
I am placing it in the pages of a magazine of speculative fiction
because that is the only venue in which a story about a signal from
before the beginning of time will be received as entertainment rather
than prophecy, and entertainment is, I think, the kindest form in
which this knowledge can be transmitted.

If you are reading this, you have heard the warning. You have heard
it in the only way that it can be heard safely — as fiction.

Whether it is fiction, I leave to you.

The receiver is in the basement. The crystals are in the filing

                        THE BOUNDARY KEEPER

                     by Father Thomas Aquino

================================================================================

                               I.

Brother Matthias had maintained the Monastery of the Last Light for
thirty-one years, and in that time he had learned that the boundary of
the observable universe was not, as the physicists described it, a
mathematical abstraction. It was a wall. It was visible. It was
beautiful. And it was, if you looked at it long enough, which he had,
alive.

The monastery occupied a small station at the farthest point that
human engineering had reached — a platform of steel and carbon
composite anchored in the deep void, thirteen billion light-years
from Earth, at the edge of everything. Beyond the station, in every
direction that could be called "outward," the cosmic microwave
background radiation — the afterglow of the universe's birth — was
visible to the naked eye. Not as a faint, diffuse warmth, as it
appeared from within the body of the universe, but as a wall. A wall
of light.

It was the oldest light in existence. It had been traveling for
thirteen point eight billion years, since the moment, three hundred
and eighty thousand years after the Big Bang, when the universe had
cooled enough for atoms to form and photons to move freely through
space for the first time. At the center of the universe — near Earth,
near the teeming, cluttered interior where stars and galaxies and
civilizations piled upon one another like books in a library — this
light was invisible, a whisper at the bottom of the electromagnetic
spectrum, detectable only by sensitive instruments. But here, at the
edge, where the universe thinned and the distance between objects
stretched toward infinity, the light of the cosmic background was
not behind you or around you. It was ahead. It was the horizon. It
was the last thing there was.

Brother Matthias stood at the observation window of the monastery's
chapel — a broad, clear panel that faced outward, toward the light —
and prayed.

The prayer was Compline, the Night Office, the final prayer of the
day. He prayed it at the same hour every evening, as monks had prayed
it for fifteen hundred years, though here there was no evening and no
night, only the perpetual glow of the first light against the
perpetual dark of the last space. The words were ancient. The setting
was not.

     Te lucis ante terminum,
     Rerum Creator, poscimus,
     Ut pro tua clementia,
     Sis praesul et custodia.

Before the ending of the day, Creator of all things, we pray that
with Thy wonted favor Thou wouldst be our guard and keeper.

He prayed in Latin, as the Order had always prayed. The words echoed
in the small chapel — a room of plain steel walls, a simple altar, a
crucifix of carved wood that he had brought from Earth thirty-one
years ago and that was, apart from himself, the oldest thing on the
station. The light from the observation window fell across the altar
like a benediction, pale and gold and impossibly ancient.

Brother Matthias was seventy-three years old. He had come to the
Monastery of the Last Light at the age of forty-two, a Jesuit with a
doctorate in astrophysics and a crisis of faith that he had resolved,
paradoxically, by traveling to the place where faith and physics met
the same wall. He had been a professor. He had been a researcher. He
had published papers on cosmic topology and the large-scale structure
of the universe. And then, in the manner of those whose intellect and
spirit are too honest to maintain a comfortable separation, he had
arrived at a point where the questions his science asked and the
questions his faith asked had converged, and the only honest response
was to go to the place where both sets of questions terminated and
sit there and think.

The Order of the Last Light had been founded for precisely this
purpose. A Jesuit enterprise, authorized by Rome in 2089, its mission
was contemplative: to maintain a human presence at the boundary of the
observable universe, to pray, to observe, and to bear witness to the
edge of creation. The monastery was not a research station, though it
had instruments. It was not a waypoint, though pilgrims came. It was a
chapel on the frontier of existence, and its purpose was the same as
the purpose of every chapel that had ever been built: to provide a
place where human beings could stand in the presence of something
larger than themselves and attempt, however inadequately, to respond.

The pilgrims arrived irregularly. Ships came every few months —
sometimes a research vessel, sometimes a private yacht, sometimes a
battered transport carrying passengers who had spent their savings to
reach the edge. The pilgrims were various. Some were devout — Catholics,
Protestants, Buddhists, Muslims, adherents of faiths that had no
name, seekers of the numinous who had been drawn by the same instinct
that had drawn monks and mystics to mountaintops and deserts for
millennia. Some were scientists, drawn by the opportunity to observe
the CMB at close range. Some were tourists, drawn by curiosity and the
human appetite for extremes.

And some were — Matthias had come to recognize this category over
the years — lost. People who had traveled to the edge of the universe
not because they wanted to see what was there but because they had
nowhere else to go. People for whom the boundary of existence exerted
a gravitational pull, not of physics but of psyche. People who looked
at the wall of light and saw not the beginning of the universe but
the end of their own journey.

Matthias served them all. He provided hospitality — a bed, a meal, the
simple comforts that the station could offer. He provided conversation,
when it was wanted, and silence, when it was not. He provided the
liturgy, celebrated daily in the chapel, open to anyone who wished to
attend and meaningful, he believed, whether anyone attended or not.

And he provided witness. He stood at the boundary and he looked at the
light and he bore witness, with his body and his mind and his prayer,
to the fact that the universe had an edge, and that a man of faith
stood at it, and that standing there was not contradiction but
completion.

                               II.

The pilgrim who changed everything arrived on a Wednesday.

Her name was Sera Olunfemi. She was forty-five years old, a former
theoretical physicist from the University of Lagos who had left
academia five years earlier under circumstances she did not discuss.
She was tall, angular, with close-cropped gray hair and eyes of such
dark brown that they appeared black — eyes that looked at the world
with an intensity that Matthias recognized, because he had seen it
before, in people whose minds worked faster than their hearts could
bear.

She arrived on a commercial transport that had detoured to the
monastery at her request. She carried a single bag. She asked for a
room.

"How long will you be staying?" Matthias asked, in the small reception
area that served as the station's foyer.

"I don't know."

"You are welcome for as long as you wish. We ask only that you respect
the community's rhythm — the hours of prayer, the hours of silence."

"I am familiar with monastic discipline, Brother. My grandmother was
a Benedictine oblate." A pause. "I am here because I want to see the
wall."

"The cosmic microwave background."

"The wall," she repeated, with a firmness that suggested she had
chosen the word deliberately.

Matthias led her to the chapel. He opened the door and stepped aside,
allowing her to enter first. The observation window faced them — a
broad rectangle of clarity, and beyond it, the light.

Sera Olunfemi stood in the doorway and looked at the light. She did
not move for a very long time. Matthias, who had seen this reaction
many times — the first sight of the boundary was, for most visitors, a
profoundly arresting experience — waited with the patience of a man
who had been waiting, in one form or another, for thirty-one years.

"It is not what I expected," she said, at last.

"What did you expect?"

"Something — colder. More abstract. I expected to see radiation. I see
light. There is a difference."

"Yes. There is."

"It looks like — " She paused. "It looks like dawn. The very first
dawn. The light that existed before there were eyes to see it."

"That is, in a sense, exactly what it is."

She turned to him. Her dark eyes were bright, and in them Matthias saw
something he had learned to recognize and to honor: the expression of
a human being who has encountered the edge of comprehension and is
deciding whether to retreat or advance.

"I am going to walk into it," she said.

                               III.

Matthias did not respond immediately. He had heard similar statements
before — not many, but enough to have developed an understanding of
what they meant. Some visitors were moved to metaphor by the sight of
the boundary. They spoke of "walking into the light" in the same way
they might speak of "touching the face of God" — as an expression of
awe, not a declaration of intent.

But Sera Olunfemi was not speaking in metaphor. Matthias could see
this in her face, in the precise set of her jaw, in the calm of her
voice. She was a physicist. She meant what she said.

"That is not possible," Matthias said, gently.

"Why not?"

"The cosmic microwave background is not a physical surface. It is a
boundary of observation — the point beyond which we cannot see because
the universe, at earlier times, was opaque. There is no wall to walk
into. There is only light, and beyond the light, more space — space
that we cannot observe but that exists."

"I know the physics, Brother. I was a cosmologist for twenty years.
I know that the CMB is an observational horizon, not a physical
barrier. But look at it." She gestured toward the window. "Does that
look like an abstraction to you?"

Matthias looked. He had been looking at the boundary for thirty-one
years, and in that time his understanding of it had shifted, gradually
and profoundly, from the scientific to the — he did not have a word
for it. Not the mystical. Not the supernatural. Something more honest
than either. The boundary was what it was: the oldest light in the
universe, arriving at the farthest point that humans had reached, and
presenting itself to the eye not as data but as presence. As an
encounter.

"No," he said. "It does not look like an abstraction."

"I have spent five years preparing for this, Brother. I left my
position. I sold my possessions. I traveled twelve billion light-years.
I am here because I believe that the boundary of the observable
universe is not merely an observational limit. I believe it is a
threshold. And I believe that what lies beyond it is not more space,
or at least not only more space. I believe that what lies beyond it is
— " She stopped. "I cannot say what I believe lies beyond it, because
I do not have the language. I believe that walking through the
threshold is the only way to know."

"And if what lies beyond the threshold is death?"

"Then I will learn something about death that no one has learned
before."

Matthias studied her. She was not agitated. She was not delusional.
She was calm, composed, and articulate, and her intention was clear.
She wanted to put on an environment suit, step through the station's
airlock, and walk into the light of the cosmic microwave background
until she either encountered something or did not return.

"The station's environment suits are designed for maintenance EVAs,"
he said. "They have a range of approximately ten kilometers before
life support is exhausted."

"That will be sufficient."

"You cannot know that."

"No. But ten kilometers is ten kilometers farther than anyone has
gone. It will have to be enough."

                               IV.

Matthias spent three days trying to dissuade her.

He tried physics. The CMB was not a wall. It was a surface of last
scattering — the boundary of the visible universe, not the boundary
of the universe itself. Beyond it lay more universe — billions of
light-years of space and matter that humanity could not observe because
the light from those regions had not had time to reach this point. She
would walk into ordinary space, see the same stars and galaxies that
were visible in every other direction, and die when her suit's air
ran out.

Sera listened politely and disagreed. "You are describing the physics
as they are understood from the interior. I am interested in the
physics as they are experienced at the boundary."

He tried theology. The contemplative tradition, in which Matthias had
been trained, taught that the encounter with the divine was not a
physical journey but an interior one. The mystics had traveled to the
boundary of the self, not the boundary of the universe. To walk into
the light was to confuse the metaphor with the reality.

Sera listened politely and disagreed. "Perhaps the metaphor and the
reality are the same thing. Perhaps the boundary of the self and the
boundary of the universe are the same boundary, and the only way to
test this is to walk."

He tried compassion. "You have people who care about you. You have a
life. What you are proposing is — I will not call it suicide. But it
is an act from which you cannot return, and the people you leave
behind will grieve."

For the first time, Sera's composure shifted. Something moved behind
her dark eyes — a grief already present, already accounted for. "I
have no one, Brother. The people I loved are dead. My parents. My
husband. My daughter. My daughter was seven when she died. She had a
disease with a long name that I can spell but cannot bear to say.
After she died, I continued to work. I continued to teach. I continued
to be a person in the world for five years. And then I could not
continue anymore, and I began to prepare for this. Not because I want
to die. Because I want to know what is on the other side. Because
my daughter is on the other side. Not because I believe in an
afterlife in the way that your tradition teaches it, Brother, but
because I believe that the boundary of the universe is a real thing,
and that real things have other sides, and that the other side is
where the light goes when it passes beyond the horizon."

Matthias was quiet for a long time after this. They were sitting in
the refectory — a small room with a metal table and two chairs and
a viewport that looked inward, away from the boundary, toward the
dark and scattered stars. Matthias looked at his hands, folded on
the table, and thought about his own losses — a brother, dead at
thirty; a mother, dead at sixty-eight; the slow, accumulating weight
of years spent at the edge of everything, watching the light and
praying and waiting for an understanding that had not come.

"I cannot stop you," he said. "The station is not a prison, and you
are not my charge. But I ask you to consider one thing."

"Yes?"

"If you walk into the light and do not return, I will not know what
happened. I will not know whether you found what you were looking for,
or whether you simply died. And I will spend the rest of my life at
this window, looking at the light, wondering."

"Yes. You will. And that wondering will be, I think, a form of
prayer."

                               V.

She went on the seventh day.

Matthias helped her into the environment suit in the airlock. It was a
standard EVA suit — white, bulky, with a clear faceplate that framed
her face like a portrait. She moved with the calm efficiency of someone
who had prepared every detail and was now executing a plan that had
been in formation for years.

"I would like to pray with you before I go," she said.

"Of course."

They stood together in the airlock — the monk and the physicist, the
believer and the seeker, two people at the boundary of everything —
and Matthias prayed. He chose a psalm. Not one of the triumphant
psalms, not one of the penitential psalms, but Psalm 139, which had
been his companion for thirty-one years at the edge of the universe.

     Whither shall I go from thy spirit?
     Or whither shall I flee from thy presence?
     If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there:
     If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, thou art there.
     If I take the wings of the morning,
     And dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea;
     Even there shall thy hand lead me,
     And thy right hand shall hold me.

"Even there," Sera repeated. "Even at the uttermost parts."

"Yes."

"Then it does not matter which side of the boundary I am on."

"No," Matthias said. "It does not matter."

She smiled. It was the first time he had seen her smile — a brief,
surprising expression that transformed her angular face into something
younger and softer and full of a light that was not the light of the
CMB but was, he thought, related to it.

"Thank you, Brother."

"Go with God, Sera."

She sealed her faceplate. Matthias cycled the airlock. The outer door
opened. Beyond it was the void — the deep, empty space between the
station and the boundary, illuminated by the pale gold light that was
the oldest thing in the universe.

Sera stepped out. The magnetic soles of her boots gripped the
station's hull. She walked to the edge of the platform, and then she
stepped off, into space, and her suit's maneuvering thrusters carried
her forward, toward the light.

Matthias watched from the chapel window.

She moved slowly. A white figure against the dark, drifting toward the
gold. The suit's telemetry transmitted to the station's monitors —
position, velocity, life signs, air supply. All nominal. She was
moving at approximately two meters per second, outward, toward the
boundary.

At one kilometer, Matthias could still see her suit — a small white
point, like a star that had detached from the firmament and was
moving with purpose.

At five kilometers, she was barely visible. A mote. A speck of white
against the infinite gold.

At eight kilometers, the telemetry signal began to degrade. Static
crept into the data. The life signs readings flickered. The position
coordinates drifted, as though the space she occupied was becoming
less certain.

At nine kilometers, the signal broke up. Fragments of data arrived at
the station's receivers — a heartbeat, a temperature reading, a
fragment of audio that might have been breathing or might have been
static.

At ten kilometers — the limit of the suit's range — the signal
ceased. Completely. Not a gradual fade, not a weakening signal
dissolving into noise, but a clean termination, as though a door had
closed.

Matthias stood at the window. The gold light of the boundary was
unchanged — the same pale, ancient glow that had greeted him every
morning for thirty-one years. There was no sign of Sera Olunfemi. No
suit. No signal. No indication that a woman had walked into the
oldest light in the universe and not come back.

He stood there for a very long time.

                               VI.

In the days that followed, Matthias searched. He ran the station's
instruments at maximum sensitivity, scanning the region where Sera
had disappeared for any trace — thermal, electromagnetic, gravitational
— of her presence. He found nothing. Not the nothing of a signal too
faint to detect, but the nothing of absence. The space where she had
been was empty. It was as though she had never been there.

He filed a report with the Order. He reported the facts: a pilgrim
had arrived, had expressed the intention to walk into the CMB, had
done so, and had not returned. The report was transmitted to Earth.
A reply came, after the appropriate signal delay: the Order
acknowledged the report, expressed its condolences, and asked whether
Brother Matthias required anything. He did not.

He returned to his routine. The hours of prayer. The maintenance of
the station. The observation of the boundary. But the routine had
changed. It had acquired a question that had not been there before,
and the question was not theological and not scientific but personal,
and it was this: What had she found?

Not what had happened to her — Matthias could construct any number of
hypotheses about what had happened, from the mundane (suit failure,
death by asphyxiation, body drifting in space too far for the
instruments to detect) to the extraordinary. The question was not
about what had happened. It was about what she had found. Had the
boundary been what she believed it to be — a threshold, a door, a
transition from one state to another? Had there been something on the
other side? Had she, in the last moments of her journey, encountered
whatever lay beyond the oldest light in the universe?

And the deeper question, the one that Matthias could not ask without
trembling: Was her daughter there?

He prayed. He prayed Compline every evening, standing at the window,
looking at the light. The words were the same words he had prayed for
thirty-one years. But they had acquired a new weight, a new urgency,
because now they were not a general prayer offered to a general God
but a specific prayer offered on behalf of a specific woman who had
walked into the light and not come back.

     Te lucis ante terminum.

Before the ending of the day. Before the ending of everything. Before
the boundary of the observable universe and whatever lay beyond it.

     Sis praesul et custodia.

Be our guard and keeper. Be her guard and keeper. Be the keeper of
the boundary, and of those who cross it, and of those who stand at
it and wonder.

                               VII.

Three months after Sera's departure, Matthias made his decision.

He made it not in a moment of crisis or revelation but in the quiet,
gradual way that the most important decisions are made — through the
accumulation of small recognitions, each one insufficient on its own,
building over days and weeks into a weight that finally tips the
balance.

He recognized that his life at the boundary had been a preparation.
Thirty-one years of prayer, observation, and witness had brought him
to a point where the question Sera had asked — what lies beyond? —
was no longer a question he could contemplate from a distance. It was
a question that required an answer, and the answer required the same
thing that Sera had understood: not theory, but experience. Not
observation, but participation.

He was seventy-three years old. His body was sound — the station's
medical systems maintained his health with mechanical efficiency — but
his time was finite. He had perhaps ten years left, perhaps twenty.
He could spend them at the window, looking at the light and wondering.
Or he could do what he had been trained to do, as a Jesuit, as a
scientist, as a man of faith: he could go and see.

The decision was not easy. It was, in fact, the most difficult
decision of his life. Not because he feared death — he had considered
death with the thoroughness of a Jesuit and the equanimity of a man
who had spent three decades in the presence of the oldest light in
the universe. But because following Sera meant leaving the monastery,
and the monastery was his vocation, his home, and the anchor of his
identity for more than half his life. To leave it was to leave
himself.

But then — and this was the recognition that tipped the balance — he
had been leaving himself, slowly, for thirty-one years. The boundary
had been doing its work on him, as it did its work on everyone who
came here. It stripped away. It reduced. It confronted you with the
fact of the edge, the fact that the known world ended and the unknown
began, and it asked you, with the patience of thirteen billion years:
What are you going to do about it?

Matthias wrote a letter to the Order. He explained his decision. He
asked that a replacement be sent to maintain the monastery. He asked
that his personal effects — the crucifix, his books, the small
collection of letters he had received over the years from pilgrims who
had visited and written back — be donated to the Order's archives.

He celebrated a final Mass in the chapel. He was alone. The light from
the boundary fell across the altar as it always had, and the words of
the liturgy echoed in the small room as they always had, and everything
was the same and everything was different.

He put on the environment suit. It fit him differently than it had
fit Sera — he was shorter, broader, and the suit was not designed for
a man of his age. But it would serve.

He entered the airlock. He sealed the inner door. He looked through
the small viewport at the chapel — the altar, the crucifix, the
observation window, the light.

He prayed one last prayer. Not Compline. Not a psalm. A simple prayer,
in his own words, spoken quietly into the helmet of an environment
suit at the edge of the observable universe:

"Lord, I have stood at the boundary of your creation for thirty-one
years. I have looked at the light you made, the first light, the
oldest light. I have prayed in its presence. I have borne witness. And
now I am going to walk into it, not because I am certain of what I
will find, but because certainty was never the point. Faith was always
the point. And faith is not standing at the boundary and believing
that something lies beyond. Faith is walking through."

He cycled the airlock.

The outer door opened.

The light was there. The same light. Ancient, gold, patient.

Brother Matthias stepped out.

                               * * *

He walked. The maneuvering thrusters carried him forward, as they had
carried Sera, into the void between the station and the boundary. The
station fell away behind him. The light grew ahead of him. He did not
look back.

At one kilometer, he felt a change. Not a physical change — the suit's
instruments showed nothing anomalous. But a change in the quality of
the space around him, as though the void were becoming thinner,
more transparent, as though he were moving not through space but
through a medium that was increasingly permeable to something that
space normally excluded.

At five kilometers, the change was unmistakable. The light was no
longer ahead of him. It was around him. He was inside it, or it was
inside him, or the distinction between inside and outside had begun to
dissolve. The suit's instruments flickered. The readings made less
sense. The numbers still arrived on his heads-up display, but they
seemed to describe a reality that was becoming optional.

At eight kilometers, Brother Matthias heard something.

Not through the suit's audio sensors, which registered nothing. Not
through his ears, which heard only the sound of his own breathing
inside the helmet. He heard it in the way that the mystics described
hearing — with the interior ear, the ear of the soul, the faculty
that perceived not sound but meaning.

It was singing.

Not a song he recognized. Not a hymn or a chant or a melody. It was
singing the way the light was light — fundamental, primal, the sound
that sound was made of. It rose from no direction and from every
direction, and it was beautiful in a way that the word "beautiful" was
not adequate to describe, because beauty was a category of human
experience and this was not human experience, this was the experience
that existed before human experience, the experience that human
experience was an echo of.

At nine kilometers, the singing filled him. He could not distinguish
it from his own consciousness. He could not distinguish himself from
the light. The suit was still around him — he could see the heads-up
display, the numbers, the life support readings — but these things
were becoming transparent, the way the void had become transparent,
the way everything at the boundary became transparent when you moved
through it rather than looking at it.

At ten kilometers, Brother Matthias understood.

He understood what the boundary was. He understood what lay beyond it.
He understood what Sera had found. He understood why she had not come
back — not because she had died, but because there was no "back" to
come to. The boundary was not a wall and not a threshold and not a
door. It was a horizon, as the physicists had said, but not the kind
of horizon they meant. It was the horizon between the finite and the
infinite, between the created and the Creator, between the light that
had been made and the Light that had made it.

He understood this not as a proposition or a proof but as an
experience — the experience of the boundary dissolving, of the
distinction between observer and observed giving way, of the edge of
the map giving way to the territory that the map had always been
trying to describe.

The singing continued. The light continued. Brother Matthias continued,
though "continued" was no longer quite the right word, because the
time in which continuation happened was becoming transparent too, and
what remained when time became transparent was not eternity in the
sense of infinite duration but eternity in the sense of a single,
perfect, endlessly present moment.

He took one more step.

The telemetry signal reached the station and ceased. Cleanly.
Completely. As though a door had closed.

                               VIII.

The Monastery of the Last Light stood empty.

The instruments continued to operate. The life support systems
maintained their cycles. The chapel remained, with its altar and its
crucifix and its observation window, the oldest light in the universe
falling across the empty room in a pattern that changed with the
station's slow rotation — gold, pale, warm, ancient.

On the altar, Brother Matthias had left a note. It was written in his
careful, slanting hand, on a sheet of the thin paper the station used
for its records. It read:

     To whoever comes next:

     The boundary is real. The light is real. What lies
     beyond it is real, and it is not what we feared, and
     it is not what we hoped. It is what it is, which is
     more than either fear or hope can hold.

     Maintain the chapel. Pray the hours. Welcome the
     pilgrims.

     And if one of them asks to walk into the light —
     let them go. Let them go with your blessing and
     your prayers and your trust that the Light which
     made all light is a Light that keeps what it
     receives.

     In nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti.

     Brother Matthias, O.L.L.

The note lay on the altar. The light fell on it. The station turned,
slowly, in the void, at the boundary of everything, and the cosmic
microwave background glowed on, patient and ancient and warm, and the
monastery waited for whoever would come next to stand at the window
and look at the light and ask the question that the light had always
been asking, in its silent, luminous, thirteen-billion-year-old voice:

What lies beyond?

The answer was there. It had always been there. It was waiting, as it
had always been waiting, at the edge of the map, in the last light,
in the place where the known ended and the unknown began and the
boundary between them was not a wall but a welcome.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

GUNNAR ERIKSSON is a Swedish writer whose stories of deep space travel
and generation ships have graced these pages since issue #16. A literary
translator by profession, he writes his fiction in English from his home
in Stockholm, and his prose carries the spare, luminous quality of a
Scandinavian winter. His stories have appeared in Galaxy, The Magazine
of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and several Swedish-language anthologies.
Ray Bradbury called his debut story "The Long Watch" the loneliest and
most beautiful story he had ever read, a judgment with which this editor
concurs. "Atlas of Emptiness" is his most ambitious work for us to date,
and we suspect it may be the most ambitious thing we publish this year.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, and we are proud of every story he has given us. A former
technical writer at General Motors and a veteran of the Battle of the
Bulge, Cain writes with the steady reliability of a man who shows up,
does the job, and delivers on time — and who, when the occasion calls
for it, delivers something that surprises even his editor. "Borderline"
is Cain at his most charming: a story about bureaucracy that is somehow
also a story about the human heart. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan,
with his wife Jean and continues to write every evening from eight
to midnight without fail.

CORDELL BEAUMONT writes about alien worlds the way a lover writes about
the beloved. Born and raised in New Orleans, Beaumont brings the
sensory richness of the Gulf Coast to every planet he describes, and
the result is prose of such lush beauty that it occasionally makes
this editor forget he is reading a manuscript and not standing knee-
deep in an alien garden. His stories have been a fixture of these
pages since "The Vermillion Plateau" in issue #10, and "Terra
Incognita" may be his finest and most sobering work — a story that
begins in wonder and ends in warning. He lives in the Faubourg Marigny
with his wife Lisette, a painter, and a courtyard garden of legendary
splendor.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY learned to write in the pulps, and thank God he
did. A veteran of two hundred stories across every genre the pulp
magazines offered, Finley brings a narrative velocity and a tough-guy
wit to his science fiction that no amount of literary ambition can
replicate. "The Frontier Surgeon" is Finley at his best: a story that
grabs you by the collar on page one and does not let go until the last
line. He lives in Chicago with his wife Carol, a number of cats, and
his inexhaustible supply of Lucky Strikes. He describes his writing
method as "sit down, start typing, and don't stop until somebody's
either saved or dead."

LUCIAN MARSH is our dark dreamer, our Lovecraft of the void, and the
only contributor to this magazine who lists his address as "Arkham,
Massachusetts" when everyone knows he lives in Newburyport. His stories
occupy the troubled borderland between science fiction and horror, and
they are unlike anything else in these pages or anyone else's pages.
"The Last Frequency" is Marsh at his most unsettling — a story that
begins as an experiment and ends as an experience that the reader may
wish they had not had, but will not forget. He communicates with this
office exclusively by letter and has never been seen in public.

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO, S.J., is an ordained Jesuit priest, a professor
of philosophy and theology at Loyola University in Baltimore, and one
of the most thoughtful voices in science fiction. His stories explore
the intersection of faith and science with a compassion and intellectual
honesty that this editor finds deeply moving and deeply necessary. "The
Boundary Keeper" is his most personal work for us — a story about a
monk at the edge of everything, which is, Father Aquino would remind
us, precisely where monks have always belonged. He writes slowly,
carefully, and never more than one or two stories a year, and we
treasure each one.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading "The Bathysphere" by Lucian Marsh in your
March issue and I must say that I have not slept properly since. The
image of the diving bell descending into the dark water of Europa's
subsurface ocean will stay with me until I am old and gray, which at
this rate will be next week. Mr. Marsh is either a genius or a madman
and I suspect he is both. More, please — but perhaps not immediately.
I need to recover.

                                 Providence, Rhode Island

Dear Max,

The Eriksson story in your February issue ("The Passage of Light") was
exquisite. I have read it three times and each time I find something
new. There is a sentence on page 17 — "The stars were not above them
or below them but around them, and the ship moved through them the way
a thought moves through silence" — that I would like to have engraved
on my tombstone, if tombstones were allowed to be that long. Please
tell Mr. Eriksson that he has a devoted reader in Flagstaff.

                              — Dr. Marian Oakes
                                 Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona

Dear Editor,

I wish to register a technical objection to "Crash Vector" by Bob
Finley in your April issue. The protagonist's ship cannot possibly
have executed the maneuver described on page 89, as it would require
a delta-v exceeding the ship's stated fuel capacity by a factor of
three. I have enclosed my calculations on the attached sheet. That said,
I enjoyed the story enormously and read it twice. Please do not let
Mr. Finley anywhere near an actual spacecraft.

                              — James Wentworth, M.E.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Is it too much to ask for more stories like Father Aquino's "The
Problem of Other Souls" from your December issue? In a field that too
often treats religion as either a joke or a villain, Father Aquino
writes about faith with intelligence and respect. I am not a religious
man, but his story made me think more carefully about what I do and
do not believe, and any story that accomplishes that has earned its
place in the world. My compliments to the Father.

                              — Leonard Strauss

to keep writing. Address your correspondence to: Letters, Tales from

THE STARS MY DESTINATION by Alfred Bester
(Signet Books, 1956, $0.35)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Bester has done it again. Three years after "The Demolished Man"
announced him as the most audacious stylist in science fiction, he
returns with a novel that makes its predecessor look restrained.
Gully Foyle, the most unlikely hero in the genre's history — a brute,
a monster, a man driven by pure vengeance — blazes through a future
of teleportation, corporate warfare, and synaesthetic excess in a
narrative that never pauses for breath and never condescends to
comfort. Bester's prose is pyrotechnic, his plotting relentless, and
his vision of humanity both savage and strangely hopeful. This is
science fiction as fireworks display: blinding, deafening, and over
too soon. Essential.

DOUBLE STAR by Robert A. Heinlein
(Doubleday, 1956, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Heinlein, our genre's most dependable craftsman, has written a
political thriller disguised as a science fiction novel — or perhaps
a science fiction novel disguised as a political thriller. When a down-
on-his-luck actor is recruited to impersonate a kidnapped political
leader, the result is a tight, suspenseful, and surprisingly touching
story about identity, duty, and the strange alchemy by which pretense
becomes reality. Heinlein's prose is characteristically clean and
assured, his plotting is airtight, and his protagonist — vain,
talented, and unexpectedly noble — is one of his most memorable
creations. This will win awards, and it should.

THE DEATH OF GRASS by John Christopher
(Michael Joseph, 1956, 12s 6d)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Christopher's British catastrophe novel imagines a world in which
a virus destroys all grass species — wheat, rice, barley, the lawns
of England — and civilization collapses with terrifying speed. It is
a bleak, unsentimental, and ruthlessly logical book, and it is one
of the most frightening novels I have read in years. Christopher is
less interested in the catastrophe itself than in its effect on
human morality: how quickly do decent people abandon decency when
survival is at stake? His answer is: very quickly indeed. Not a
comfortable read, but a necessary one. Recommended, with the
suggestion that you keep a box of crackers nearby.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #42 — June 1956

We are pleased to announce the contents of our June issue:

"THE MERIDIAN PROBLEM" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A navigational anomaly
near a neutron star forces a research team to reconsider the
fundamental assumptions of interstellar cartography. When their
instruments disagree about the location of the star itself, the
question becomes not where they are but what "where" means. Koslov
at his most rigorous and most philosophical.

"THE SULTAN OF CENTAURI" by Rex Drummond — Captain Jace Rennick
encounters a self-proclaimed emperor on an uncharted world who
commands a fleet of ships that should not exist and an army of beings
that may not be alive. Drummond at his most swashbuckling.

"THE GARDEN CONSTANT" by Margaret Thornton — On a terraformed world,
an ecologist discovers that the planet's imported biosphere has begun
to produce a molecule that exists nowhere else in the known universe.
Thornton at her most luminous.

"THE MIDNIGHT TRANSFER" by Theodore Cain — A routine personnel transfer
between deep-space stations goes wrong when the transport ship arrives
at its destination carrying one more passenger than it departed with.
Cain at his most suspenseful.

Plus: a new story by Agnes Whitfield, letters from our readers, book
reviews, and more.
