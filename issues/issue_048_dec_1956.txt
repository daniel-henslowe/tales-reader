TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

Four years.

I have written forty-seven of these letters — one for each issue since
January 1953, when a slender magazine with a lurid cover and an ambitious
name appeared on newsstands across the country and asked, with more
confidence than was perhaps warranted, for your attention and your
thirty-five cents. You gave us both. You gave us far more than both.

This is the forty-eighth, and the last of its kind.

I want to be plain about what is happening, because you have earned
plainness from me. Meridian Publishing Company has decided to suspend
monthly publication of Tales from the Future and Beyond, effective with
this issue. The reasons are financial — they are always financial — and I
will not burden you with the arithmetic of declining newsstand sales and
rising paper costs. What matters is the decision, and the decision is made.

But I want to be equally plain about what is not happening. This magazine
is not dying. It is resting. Meridian and I have agreed that Tales from
the Future and Beyond will return — in a new format, on a new schedule,
with new ambitions appropriate to a new era. When that return will occur,
I cannot say with certainty. I can say that it will occur, because
neither Meridian nor I are prepared to accept that this story is finished.

The story, after all, has been extraordinary.

In forty-eight issues, we have published over three hundred stories by
some of the finest writers working in the field of imaginative fiction.
We have sent human beings to Mars and Mercury, to the moons of Jupiter
and the rings of Saturn, to worlds orbiting distant suns, and to places
that exist only in the territory between physics and dream. We have built
space elevators and generation ships, designed robots that think and
aliens that love, imagined wars we hoped would never happen and peaces we
prayed someday would. We have asked what it means to be human in a
universe that is very large and very old and does not, on its face,
appear to care — and we have answered, forty-eight times, that it means
to keep asking.

I did not do this alone. I did not do even a small part of it alone.

The writers who have filled these pages are the magazine, and I have been
merely the man who held the door open and tried not to get in the way.
Dr. Koslov gave us rigor and wonder in equal measure. Rex Drummond made
our pulses race and our hearts pound. Margaret Thornton showed us that
the most alien landscapes are alive in ways we had not imagined. Arthur
Wainwright made us care about minds made of metal and wire. Phyllis
Crenshaw tied time itself in knots and made us laugh while she did it.
Hal Mercer built things that lasted. Bob Finley told stories that crackled
like a campfire. Gunnar Eriksson taught us that silence and emptiness
are not the same thing. Father Aquino reminded us that wonder is the
beginning of wisdom. Theodore Cain — dear, reliable, inexhaustible Ted —
gave us a story every time we needed one, and it was always the right
story. And so many others, too many to name in this small space, each of
whom trusted me with their dreams and their labor.

Thank you. I say it without eloquence because eloquence would be
insufficient. Thank you for writing. Thank you for reading. Thank you
for arguing with us in your letters, for correcting our science when we
got it wrong, for telling us when a story moved you, for staying with us
month after month and year after year.

For this final issue, I have assembled what I believe is the finest
collection of stories we have ever published. Koslov gives us a century
of exploration seen through one extraordinary life. Mercer builds his
masterpiece and watches the future outgrow it. Cain asks us to believe
in wonder. Father Aquino finds the sacred in a new star. Crenshaw defends
hope with all the wit and wisdom she commands. Finley gathers us at a
spaceport on Christmas Eve. And Eriksson — who has been with us since the
early days, who has always understood the beauty of distance — brings a
ship home at last.

Seven stories. Seven farewells. Seven promises that the future is not
finished with us yet.

We have spent four years dreaming together, you and I and all the writers
and artists and editors who made this magazine. It has been the great
privilege of my professional life. When we return — and we will return —
I promise you this: we will honor everything that came before. The
foundation is strong. Hal Mercer would approve.

Until then, I leave you with the stars. They have been patient with us.
They will wait.

Yours among the stars, one last time,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond

                          LONG TOMORROW

                               I.

The first Mars landing was on a Tuesday.

Elena Vasquez remembered this because she had written it down, in the
small leather notebook she carried everywhere, in the precise and very
small handwriting that she had cultivated since her student days at the
University of Buenos Aires. The date was March 14, 2031. A Tuesday.
She was thirty-one years old, and she watched the landing from a
monitoring station in low Earth orbit, a cramped cylinder called Vanguard
that smelled of recycled air and instant coffee, and she wrote in her
notebook: First landing. Mars. Tuesday. I can see Olympus Mons in the
telescope. It looks like a bruise on the horizon.

She was an astrophysicist — one of nine aboard Vanguard, charged with
maintaining the solar observation instruments and processing the data
they produced. The Mars landing was not her mission. It was happening
290 million kilometers away, on the surface of another world, carried
out by people she had never met. But she watched it on the station's
single video screen, crowded into the common module with the other eight
crew members, and when the lander touched down and the pilot's voice
came through the static — "Contact. We are on the surface. We are on
Mars." — she felt something shift inside her, some tectonic realignment
of what she understood to be possible.

She did not cry. She was not, as a rule, a person who cried. She wrote
in her notebook: The pilot's voice was very calm. As though he were
reading coordinates. Perhaps that is how you sound when you touch
another world for the first time. Perhaps calm is the only appropriate
response to the enormity of it.

She closed the notebook and went back to her instruments. The sun was
producing an unusual coronal mass ejection, and the data needed to be
processed before the next orbital pass. The CME was large and complex,
a vast eruption of magnetized plasma that would reach Earth in
approximately forty-one hours. There were alerts to file, calculations
to verify, reports to transmit.

The sun did not care that humanity had just landed on Mars. The sun was
busy with its own concerns.

                               * * *

Elena Vasquez was born in 1999 in a small apartment in the La Boca
neighborhood of Buenos Aires, the daughter of a physics professor and a
pediatrician. Her father taught her to read the night sky before she
could read books, pointing out the constellations from the rooftop of
their building on clear winter nights — Orion the hunter, Crux the
southern cross, Carina the ship's keel — and telling her their stories
with the precise enthusiasm of a man who believed that the universe was
the most interesting thing that existed, and that it was his duty to
share this conviction with anyone who would listen.

She listened. She was a quiet child, serious and observant, with dark
eyes that missed very little and a habit of writing things down that her
mother found alternately endearing and slightly worrying. At seven, she
began keeping a notebook of astronomical observations. At twelve, she
had filled nine notebooks and had taught herself enough orbital mechanics
to calculate the transfer orbit from Earth to Mars using a pencil, a
straightedge, and a set of equations she found in a university textbook
her father had left on the kitchen table.

"She is either going to be a great scientist," her father told her
mother, "or a very thorough accountant."

She became a great scientist. She earned her doctorate at twenty-three
from the University of Buenos Aires, with a dissertation on coronal
mass ejection dynamics that was cited seventy-one times in its first
year of publication. She was recruited by the International Space
Cooperative — the multinational body that had, by the late 2020s,
replaced the patchwork of national space agencies with a single,
unified organization — and assigned to Vanguard, where she was the
youngest crew member and, by the assessment of her supervisor, the most
talented solar physicist of her generation.

She did not consider this assessment particularly meaningful. Talent, in
her experience, was a word people used to describe the visible results
of sustained effort. She had worked very hard for a very long time.
That was all.

                               II.

The second milestone came nine years later, in 2040, and Elena Vasquez
did not watch it from orbit. She watched it from very close.

The Kepler — humanity's first interplanetary vessel designed for
sustained deep-space operations — launched from the orbital
construction platform at L2 on June 7, 2040. Elena was aboard. She was
the mission's chief science officer, responsible for the astronomical
observations that would be conducted during the ship's eighteen-month
transit to Jupiter.

She was forty years old. Nine years had passed since the Mars landing,
nine years of orbital assignments, ground postings, three published
monographs on solar dynamics, and a brief, clarifying marriage to a
fellow physicist named David Chen that ended amicably after two years
when they both realized they preferred their work to each other. She
kept the ring. She kept the fond regard. She did not keep the habit of
sharing a bed, which she had never been comfortable with anyway.

The Kepler was not beautiful. It was a functional assemblage of modules
and struts, solar panels and radiator fins, built with the utilitarian
pragmatism that characterized the ISC's engineering philosophy. Its
habitation module was a rotating drum forty meters in diameter that
provided something approximating one-third Earth gravity, enough to
prevent bone loss but not enough to prevent the constant, low-level
nausea that Elena learned to ignore after the first week. It carried a
crew of twenty-two and enough supplies for two years.

The transit to Jupiter took fourteen months. Elena spent them working.
She mapped the interplanetary magnetic field with a resolution that had
never before been achieved. She collected data on cosmic ray flux
patterns that would occupy three research teams for a decade. She
observed a previously unknown class of micrometeorite with a composition
that suggested an origin outside the solar system — a finding she
reported to Earth with the careful understatement that was her habit:
"Anomalous composition detected. Possible extrasolar origin. Further
analysis required."

She also looked out the window.

This was not a scientific activity, and she did not record it in her
official logs. But the Kepler had a small observation blister — a
transparent dome mounted on the forward section, originally intended
for navigational verification — and Elena went there every evening
during the ship's artificial night cycle, after her shift was complete
and the other crew members had retired to their quarters. She would
float in the blister with the lights off, her notebook on her knee,
and look at the stars.

From the Kepler's position in deep space, far from the light pollution
of Earth or any planetary body, the stars were not merely visible. They
were overwhelming. The Milky Way was a river of light that filled half
the sky, its individual stars resolving into thousands, then tens of
thousands, then an uncountable multitude that merged into a luminous
haze at the limits of the naked eye's resolution. Elena had studied
stars for her entire professional life. She had analyzed their spectra,
calculated their masses, modeled their evolution from birth to death.
But she had never simply looked at them from a place where they could
be truly seen, and the experience was not scientific. It was something
closer to what she imagined religious people meant by the word
devotion.

She wrote in her notebook: The stars are not indifferent. That is a
projection. Indifference requires a capacity for caring that chooses
not to exercise itself. The stars have no such capacity. They simply
are. The question of whether they care about us is meaningless, because
caring is not something that stars do. What they do is burn, and in
burning, they produce the light by which we see, the elements from which
we are made, the energy on which all life depends. That is not
indifference. It is something for which we do not have an adequate word.

She closed the notebook. Jupiter was visible through the blister now —
a pale disc growing imperceptibly larger with each passing day, its
bands faintly visible, its moons tiny points of light that she could
identify by their positions and brightnesses without consulting the
ephemeris. Io. Europa. Ganymede. Callisto.

She was the first human being to see them with the naked eye from this
distance. She noted this fact without ceremony. There would be many
firsts on this mission. They were all, in a sense, beside the point.

                               III.

The third milestone was the one that changed everything, though Elena
did not understand this at the time.

In 2046, six years after the Kepler mission, the ISC completed
construction of the first practical fusion drive. The Prometheus engine,
as it was designated, was the result of thirty years of incremental
advances in plasma containment and magnetic confinement — not a
breakthrough but an accumulation, the patient work of thousands of
engineers and physicists who solved one small problem after another
until the small problems added up to a large solution.

The Prometheus engine could accelerate a spacecraft to twelve percent of
the speed of light.

Elena was forty-seven when the drive was tested. She watched the test
from the ISC's mission control center in Geneva, where she now served as
director of astrophysical research. The test vehicle — an unmanned probe
the size of a school bus — was launched from high Earth orbit and
accelerated steadily for nine hours. At the end of the burn, it was
traveling at 36,000 kilometers per second. It passed the orbit of Mars
in four hours.

The implications were immediate and staggering. At twelve percent of
light speed, a crewed vessel could reach Alpha Centauri in approximately
thirty-six years. With improvements to the drive — and the engineers
were already confident that twenty percent of light speed was achievable
within a decade — the transit time dropped to twenty-two years. A human
lifetime. Not a comfortable human lifetime, but a possible one.

The stars were reachable.

Elena sat in the control room after the test, surrounded by cheering
colleagues, and felt the same tectonic shift she had felt fifteen years
earlier when the first Mars lander touched down. Something fundamental
about the human condition had just changed. The species was no longer
confined to a single star system. In principle, if not yet in practice,
it could go anywhere.

She did not cheer. She opened her notebook and wrote: Twelve percent.
The mathematics is straightforward. At this velocity, time dilation
becomes measurable — approximately 0.7 percent at 0.12c. Negligible
for most purposes. But at higher velocities, the dilation increases
rapidly. At 0.5c, the shipboard clock runs fourteen percent slow. At
0.9c, the dilation factor is 2.29 — for every year that passes on the
ship, 2.29 years pass on Earth.

She paused. She stared at what she had written.

At 0.9c, the dilation factor is 2.29.

She had known this, of course. She had known it since she was twelve
years old, sitting on her father's rooftop in La Boca, working through
the Lorentz transformations with a pencil and a straightedge. Time
dilation was elementary physics. It was one of the first things you
learned in any course on special relativity, and it had been
experimentally verified to extraordinary precision since the early
twentieth century.

But she had never before considered it personally. She had never before
looked at the equations and thought: This will happen to me.

Because she knew, sitting in that control room at age forty-seven, that
she was going. She did not know when, or on what ship, or to what
destination. But she knew that the stars were reachable, and she knew
that she was the kind of person who, having been told that a thing was
possible, would not be able to refrain from doing it.

She closed the notebook. The cheering was subsiding. The director of
the ISC was making a speech about the dawn of a new era, using words
like "historic" and "transformative" and "the culmination of human
aspiration." Elena listened without hearing. She was thinking about
time.

                               IV.

She was fifty-three when she left Earth for the second time.

The ship was called the Magellan. It was the ISC's first interstellar
exploration vessel — not designed for a specific destination, but for
sustained deep-space operations at velocities that would make the
solar system a small and quickly receding thing behind it. The
Magellan's Prometheus drive, an improved model capable of sustaining
acceleration for months, could bring the ship to fifty-eight percent of
light speed. At that velocity, the time dilation factor was 1.23. For
every year aboard the Magellan, 1.23 years would pass on Earth.

The difference seemed small. It was not.

Elena was chief science officer, as she had been on the Kepler thirteen
years earlier. The crew was twelve — a skeleton complement, the minimum
required to operate the ship and conduct the science program. They
launched from high Earth orbit on September 3, 2052, and accelerated
outward, away from the sun, away from everything Elena had ever known.

The mission profile was open-ended. The Magellan was to travel outward
at high velocity, conducting astronomical observations that could only
be performed from the interstellar medium — measurements of the
cosmic microwave background, the interstellar magnetic field, the
density and composition of the interstellar gas. The ship would
decelerate, reverse course, and return to Earth when the science
program was complete, or when the supplies ran out, or when the crew
decided they had had enough.

Elena expected to be gone for three years, shipboard time. She was
wrong.

The science was too good. Every observation opened new questions. Every
new question demanded further investigation. The cosmic microwave
background, measured from outside the solar system's electromagnetic
noise, revealed structure at scales that had never been resolved from
Earth orbit — faint patterns that suggested something about the
geometry of the very early universe that no existing model predicted.
Elena spent months analyzing the data, filling notebook after notebook,
transmitting reports to Earth that arrived weeks later and generated
responses that arrived weeks after that.

Three years became five. Five became seven. The Magellan pushed deeper
into the interstellar medium, farther from Earth than any human being
had ever traveled — one light-year, then two, then three. The sun
dwindled behind them until it was merely the brightest star in the
constellation of their past.

Elena was sixty years old, shipboard time, when the Magellan finally
reversed course. She had been away from Earth for seven years by her
own clock. On Earth, 8.6 years had passed. She had left at fifty-three.
When she returned, she would be sixty — but Earth would have aged
sixty-one and a half years since her birth.

The difference was small. A year and a half. Barely noticeable.

But it was the first time she had experienced the equations as something
other than mathematics.

                               * * *

She returned to an Earth that was almost, but not quite, the one she
had left. The city of Geneva looked the same from orbit. The mission
control center was in the same building, staffed by some of the same
people, though they were grayer and thicker and moved more slowly than
she remembered. Her apartment had been maintained in her absence by a
friend, and the view from the window was unchanged — the lake, the
mountains, the clean Swiss light.

But the subtle differences accumulated. Technology had advanced in the
ways that technology always advances — incrementally, pervasively,
in ways that natives of the time barely noticed but that were
immediately apparent to someone who had been away. The news feeds were
slightly different. The fashions were slightly different. The slang was
slightly different. People she expected to be alive were dead. People
she expected to be young were middle-aged. A child she remembered was
now a teenager who did not remember her.

Elena spent three weeks on Earth. She attended debriefings, submitted
her data, presented her findings at a conference where she was
introduced as "one of the most important astrophysicists of her
generation" — a phrase that made her uncomfortable, because she was
increasingly uncertain which generation she belonged to.

She wrote in her notebook: The dislocation is manageable. 1.5 years is
nothing. But the principle is established. I have experienced, in a
small way, what Einstein described: the traveler ages less than the one
who stays behind. The mathematics works. It has always worked. But there
is a difference between knowing that time dilates and feeling it, and
the feeling is strange and vertiginous and not entirely unpleasant.

Three weeks after her return, she accepted the position of chief
science officer on the Magellan's second mission. The ship had been
refitted with a new drive — the Prometheus-II, capable of seventy-eight
percent of light speed. At that velocity, the dilation factor was 1.6.

She packed her notebooks. She did not pack much else.

                               V.

The second mission lasted nine years, shipboard time. On Earth, fourteen
and a half years passed.

Elena was sixty-nine when she returned. On Earth, it was 2076. She had
been born in 1999. By the calendar, she was seventy-seven years old. By
her body's clock, she was sixty-nine. The gap was eight years — eight
years that the universe had experienced and she had not.

The Earth she returned to was more different this time. Fourteen years
was long enough for genuine change. The political map had shifted. The
ISC had been reorganized. The fusion drive had been improved again — the
Prometheus-III could reach eighty-six percent of light speed, and there
were rumors of a new engine architecture that might approach ninety
percent. Two more interstellar missions had launched while she was away.
A permanent colony had been established on Mars. The first generation
of children born on Mars were now adults.

Elena attended the debriefings. She presented her findings. She tried
to readjust, and for the first time, the readjustment was difficult. The
world had not merely changed; it had moved on without her in a way that
she could feel. Old friends had aged. Colleagues had retired. The
scientific paradigm in her field had shifted, incorporating her own
data from the first mission in ways she had not anticipated and did not
entirely agree with. She was, simultaneously, a revered figure and an
anachronism — the great Elena Vasquez, hero of the Magellan missions,
whose work had opened the interstellar frontier, and who now belonged,
subtly but unmistakably, to the past.

She spent two months on Earth. She was offered a permanent position at
the University of Geneva — a distinguished chair, a generous salary, a
comfortable retirement after decades of service to the species.

She turned it down.

                               * * *

The third mission launched in 2077. The ship was no longer the Magellan.
It was a new vessel — the Endeavour — and it was faster. The
Prometheus-III drive could sustain ninety-one percent of light speed.
At that velocity, the dilation factor was 2.4. For every year aboard
the Endeavour, 2.4 years would pass on Earth.

Elena was the oldest crew member. She was sixty-nine, shipboard time,
and she had accepted the position with the full understanding of what
it meant. Every year she spent in deep space would cost her nearly two
and a half years of connection to the world she had left behind. The
gap between her personal time and Earth's time, already eight years,
would widen with every month of the mission.

She did not care. Or rather, she cared, but she had made her peace with
it. She had chosen the stars. The stars had a cost, and the cost was
time, and she was willing to pay it.

The Endeavour traveled farther than any previous mission — twelve
light-years from Earth, deep into the interstellar medium, approaching
the outer boundary of the region that the astrophysicists called the
Local Bubble. Elena conducted observations that rewrote the textbooks
on interstellar medium density gradients. She mapped structures in the
cosmic microwave background that would not be confirmed by Earth-based
observatories for another decade. She discovered, in a region of
unusually low gas density four light-years from Tau Ceti, a set of
radio emissions that bore the unmistakable signature of artificiality.

She reported this finding with characteristic understatement:
"Anomalous radio emissions detected at coordinates RA 01h 44m 04s,
Dec -15° 56' 15''. Signal structure suggests non-natural origin.
Further analysis required."

The mission lasted eleven years, shipboard time. On Earth, twenty-six
years passed.

                               VI.

Elena Vasquez was eighty years old when the Endeavour returned to
Earth in 2103. By the calendar, she was one hundred and four.

She had been away for the better part of half a century. The world she
returned to was not the world she had left. It was not the world she
had been born in. It was, in many ways, a world she did not recognize.

The ISC had been replaced by a new organization — the Interstellar
Cooperative, a body that governed not merely space exploration but an
expanding network of human settlements across three star systems. The
Prometheus engine had been superseded by a new drive — the Alcyone,
based on principles that Elena did not fully understand, capable of
ninety-seven percent of light speed. Colony ships were under
construction. An interstellar communications network, using quantum
entanglement relays, was being deployed between Sol, Alpha Centauri,
and Tau Ceti.

The radio emissions Elena had discovered near Tau Ceti had been
confirmed. They were artificial. They came from an automated beacon
of unknown origin, broadcasting a repeating mathematical sequence
that had occupied the entire field of cryptolinguistics for twenty
years. No one had deciphered it yet. No one knew who had built it.

Elena attended the debriefings. The room was full of people she did
not know, working with technologies she did not understand, speaking
a version of English that had evolved in ways that required her to
concentrate to follow. The questions they asked about her data were
sophisticated and precise, and she answered them carefully, but she
was aware, with a clarity that was almost physical, that she was a
visitor from the past.

Afterward, she went to the observation deck of the orbital station
where the debriefings had been held — a vast, curving window that
overlooked the Earth — and she stood there for a long time, looking
down.

The planet was changed. She could see it. The ice caps were different.
The coastlines were different. There were structures in orbit that
had not existed when she left — vast, gleaming constructions that
caught the sunlight and reflected it in patterns she did not recognize.
The night side of the Earth was brighter than she remembered, the
lights of cities spreading in patterns that suggested growth, expansion,
a species that was still building, still reaching, still refusing to
sit still.

She opened her notebook. She wrote: I have missed twenty-four years.
Not lost them. They happened. They happened to everyone else. The world
moved forward, as it always does, and I was not here for the moving.
I was somewhere else, looking at stars, and the stars were worth
looking at. But the cost is real. The cost is always real.

She closed the notebook.

A young woman approached her — a mission planner, perhaps twenty-five,
with the alert, slightly awed expression of someone meeting a
historical figure. "Dr. Vasquez? I wanted to — I mean, your work on
the CMB anisotropies during the Endeavour mission, it was foundational
for my thesis. I just wanted to say thank you."

Elena looked at her. The young woman had been born while Elena was in
deep space. She had grown up, gone to university, written a thesis,
and begun a career, all while Elena was traveling at ninety-one percent
of the speed of light, aging one year for every 2.4 that this young
woman experienced. They were separated by more than age. They were
separated by a gap in time that no amount of conversation could fully
bridge.

"What is your name?" Elena asked.

"Dr. Amara Osei."

"Dr. Osei. What are you working on?"

"Interstellar medium magnetics. Specifically, the anomalous field
structures you mapped near the Tau Ceti boundary. We think they may be
related to the beacon signal."

Elena nodded. "They may be. I had the same thought, but I did not have
the data to pursue it. I'm glad someone does."

The young woman smiled — grateful, excited, slightly nervous. "Would
you — would you be willing to look at our preliminary results? We
could use your perspective."

"I am one hundred and four years old," Elena said. "By the calendar."

"You're eighty," Dr. Osei said. "By any measure that matters."

Elena almost smiled. "Send me the data."

                               VII.

She did not go back to space. Not immediately. For the first time in
decades, she stayed on Earth — or rather, on the orbital station that
had become the de facto capital of humanity's expanding interstellar
civilization. She reviewed data. She consulted on missions. She wrote
papers. She tried to catch up on twenty-four years of scientific
progress, and found that while the details had changed enormously, the
fundamental questions had not. The universe was still vast, still
beautiful, still largely unexplained. The work was the same work she
had always done, merely continued by other hands.

She spent four years on the station. They were quiet years, productive
in a modest way, marked by a growing awareness that her body was
beginning to fail in the ways that eighty-four-year-old bodies fail —
joints stiffening, vision dimming, a persistent fatigue that no amount
of sleep could fully dispel. She was old. Not calendar-old — that
number was meaningless, an artifact of the gap between her personal
time and the time of the world she had left behind. She was
body-old. Her cells had divided eighty-four years' worth of times. Her
telomeres had shortened eighty-four years' worth of shortening. She
was mortal in the ordinary way.

And she was, she realized during those four quiet years, not finished.

The Interstellar Cooperative was planning something unprecedented: the
first mission to a star outside the Local Bubble — a voyage to a
G-type star thirty-two light-years from Earth, where telescopic
observations had identified a planet with liquid water, a nitrogen-
oxygen atmosphere, and spectroscopic signatures consistent with
photosynthetic life. The ship was the Horizon, and it would travel at
ninety-seven percent of light speed. The mission would last four years,
shipboard time. On Earth, sixteen years would pass.

Elena was eighty-four. If she went, she would return at eighty-eight.
The calendar would say one hundred and twenty.

She went.

                               VIII.

The planet was green.

Elena saw it first through the Horizon's telescope, still twenty
astronomical units out, decelerating hard. A pale blue-green disc
against the black, smaller than a thumbnail at arm's length, growing
imperceptibly with each passing day. By the time the ship had
decelerated to orbital velocity and taken up a position three hundred
kilometers above the surface, the planet filled the observation
blister's entire field of view, and Elena could see things that the
telescope had only hinted at.

Oceans. Continents. Clouds. The unmistakable, aching, impossible green
of living things.

She floated in the observation blister and looked down at a world that
no human being had ever seen, and she wept. Not because she was sad.
Not because she was happy. Because she was eighty-eight years old by
the clock of her body, and she had spent more than half her life
traveling between the stars, and she had given up more years than she
could count to the silent, patient mathematics of time dilation, and
here, at the end of it — or near the end, because endings, like
beginnings, were never as clean as you expected them to be — here was
a green world with blue oceans and white clouds, and it was alive.

She wrote in her notebook. Her handwriting was less precise now, the
letters larger and less controlled, the hand that held the pencil
stiffened by arthritis and age. But the habit was the same. The
notebook was the same — not the same physical notebook, of course; she
had filled dozens of them over the decades, and they were archived
in a temperature-controlled vault at the University of Buenos Aires,
a collection that scholars would one day study as a record of one life
lived at the edge of human experience.

She wrote: It is green. The planet is green. The spectrographs said
chlorophyll, and the spectrographs were right, but the word
"chlorophyll" does not capture what I see. I see green. Living green.
The green of my father's garden in La Boca, the green of the parks
along the Limmat in Zurich, the green of Earth seen from orbit on a
clear day in spring. This world is alive, and its aliveness is
visible from space, and I am the first human being to see it.

I do not feel first. I feel last. I feel as though every human being
who has ever lived is standing behind me, looking over my shoulder,
and what they see is what I see: that the universe is not a dead
thing. It is not a cold, mechanical void indifferent to our existence.
It is a place where green things grow and blue oceans catch the light
of alien suns, and we are part of it — not observers, not visitors,
but constituents. Made of the same elements, forged in the same
stellar furnaces, subject to the same physical laws.

The universe is not indifferent. It is patient. It has been doing this
— making worlds, growing things, scattering life across the
unimaginable distances between the stars — for thirteen billion years.
We are late to notice. That is all.

She closed the notebook.

                               IX.

She returned to Earth for the last time in 2119, by the calendar. She
was eighty-eight years old. The Earth was one hundred and twenty years
older than she was.

The world had changed again, as it always did. The interstellar
civilization now encompassed seven star systems. Colony ships were
departing regularly for new worlds. The beacon near Tau Ceti had been
partially deciphered, and its message — still incomplete, still
debated — appeared to be a navigational chart of nearby star systems,
created by an intelligence that had passed through this region of
space approximately two million years ago and had left the beacon as
a courtesy to anyone who came after.

A courtesy. Elena turned the word over in her mind. A civilization two
million years dead, and they had left a map. Not a warning. Not a
weapon. A map. As though they had known that someone would come along
eventually, and they wanted to help.

She was patient, too.

Elena spent her remaining years on the orbital station, watching the
ships depart. She consulted, when asked. She reviewed data, when she
could. She sat in the observation blister and looked at the stars,
which were the same stars she had looked at from her father's rooftop
in La Boca sixty years ago by her body's clock, one hundred and
twenty years ago by the world's.

The interstellar departure she had been waiting for — the one she
knew would come, the one she had worked her entire life to make
possible — was announced on a Tuesday. She noticed this, and smiled.

The ship was called the Voyager. It was the first true interstellar
vessel — not an exploration ship, not a survey mission, but a colony
ship, designed to carry ten thousand people to a new world and
establish a permanent human presence around another star. Its
destination was Kepler-442b, a terrestrial world in the habitable
zone of a K-type star, 1,206 light-years from Earth. At ninety-seven
percent of light speed, the journey would take approximately 1,243
years by the Earth's clock. By the shipboard clock, due to time
dilation, it would take approximately 306 years.

Three hundred and six years. Twelve generations. A journey so long
that the people who arrived would have no living memory of the people
who departed. A journey that required not merely technology but faith —
faith that the ship would hold, faith that the generations would
continue, faith that the destination would be worth reaching.

Elena was ninety-one years old when the Voyager departed. She watched
it from the observation blister, as she had watched so many things
from so many observation blisters over the long course of her life.
The ship was visible for a few minutes as a bright point of light,
its fusion drive blazing against the dark, and then it was gone —
swallowed by the distance, absorbed into the vast and patient dark
between the stars.

She opened her notebook. Her handwriting was very large now, and not
entirely steady, but the words were clear.

It is gone. The first true colony ship. The first departure for a
world beyond easy return. They will not come back. They will go
forward, into the unknown, carrying everything we know and everything
we are, and they will become something we cannot predict. That is the
point. That has always been the point.

I have watched the first Mars landing, the first deep-space mission,
the first interstellar engine test, the first extrasolar planet
survey, and now the first interstellar departure. I have seen a
century of exploration — not a calendar century, but a lived century,
experienced in the fragmentary, dilated way that relativistic travel
permits. I have been a witness. That is the word I want. Not a
participant. Not a hero. A witness.

And what I have witnessed is this: the universe is not indifferent.
It is patient. It has been waiting for us — not with consciousness,
not with intent, but with the calm, structural patience of physical
law. The stars were always there. The distances were always crossable.
The worlds were always waiting. We simply needed time to reach them.

And time, as I have learned better than most, is a flexible thing.

She closed the notebook. She placed the pencil carefully beside it.
Through the observation blister, the stars burned steadily in the dark,
as they had always burned, as they would burn for billions of years
after the last human hand had closed the last notebook and the last
pair of human eyes had looked up and wondered.

She was not afraid. She was not sad. She was tired, and she was finished,
and the stars were patient, and she was grateful.

She rested her hands in her lap, and she looked at the sky, and the
sky looked back.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                          BUILDER'S REST

                       by Harold "Hal" Mercer

================================================================================

                               I.

The elevator was still standing. That was the first thing Jack Petersen
noticed when the shuttle banked over the equatorial coast and the
morning clouds parted beneath them. The elevator was still standing,
and it was still the most beautiful piece of engineering he had ever
seen, even from forty thousand feet, even through a rain-streaked
viewport, even after twenty-three years.

It rose from the coastline like a filament of spider silk drawn toward
heaven — a single, impossibly slender column that vanished into the
upper atmosphere and kept going, climbing through the stratosphere, the
mesosphere, the thermosphere, and out into the black vacuum beyond,
eighty-seven thousand kilometers of carbon nanotube composite cable
anchored to a concrete foundation pad on the shore of equatorial Africa
and terminating at a counterweight station in geosynchronous orbit.

Jack had built it. Every meter of it.

"Ladies and gentlemen," the shuttle's pilot announced over the cabin
speaker, "if you look to the port side, you'll see the Mombasa Space
Elevator, one of the engineering wonders of the twenty-second century.
The elevator was completed in 2089 and was the first permanent Earth-to-
orbit transportation system. At its peak, it carried approximately four
hundred metric tons of cargo per day to geosynchronous orbit. It was
designed by a team led by Dr. Jackson Petersen of the International
Space Cooperative."

A murmur of polite interest from the other passengers. A few heads
turned toward the windows. A child in the row ahead pressed her face
against the glass and said, "Mommy, is that the string to space?"

"It is," her mother said, smiling.

Jack sat very still in his seat and did not look out the window. He had
been looking at the elevator in his mind for twenty-three years. He did
not need the window.

"The elevator is no longer in active commercial service," the pilot
continued, with the practiced cadence of a man who had delivered this
speech several hundred times. "It was decommissioned in 2101 following
the introduction of orbital launch loop technology, which made cable-
based systems economically obsolete. It is currently maintained as a
heritage site and tourist attraction by the East African Heritage
Authority. Guided tours are available at the base station and at the
orbital platform. We will be landing at Mombasa International Spaceport
in approximately twelve minutes."

Jack reached into his jacket pocket and felt for the object he had
carried from Detroit — a small section of carbon nanotube cable, four
centimeters long and two millimeters in diameter, encased in a clear
acrylic block. It was a sample from the first production run of the
cable that had become the elevator's spine. He had kept it on his desk
for thirty-five years, and before that, he had carried it in his pocket
during the seven years of construction, a talisman and a reminder.

He turned the acrylic block over in his fingers. The cable inside was
black, with a faint iridescent sheen, and it looked like nothing — like
a sliver of dark thread frozen in glass. But that sliver of thread had a
tensile strength of 130 gigapascals and a specific strength that
exceeded any material previously manufactured by a factor of eleven. It
was the material that had made the elevator possible. Without it, the
concept of a space elevator was a physicist's daydream. With it, the
concept became an engineering problem.

Jack Petersen had solved engineering problems for a living. He had
solved them for fifty years, starting with bridge footings in Ohio and
ending with the largest structure ever built by human hands. And then
the future had outgrown him, as it always does, and he had gone home
to Detroit.

The shuttle began its descent.

                               II.

He had not planned to come back.

The invitation had arrived three months ago, on a September afternoon
when the trees along his street in Dearborn were just beginning to turn.
It was a formal letter on heavy cream paper, embossed with the seal of
the East African Heritage Authority, and it invited Dr. Jackson K.
Petersen to attend the twenty-fifth anniversary celebration of the
Mombasa Space Elevator's completion, "in recognition of his
extraordinary contribution to the advancement of human civilization."

Dorothy had found him sitting at the kitchen table with the letter in
one hand and his reading glasses in the other, staring at the words
with an expression she recognized from forty-eight years of marriage.

"You're going," she said. It wasn't a question.

"I don't know."

"Jack. You're going."

"It's a tourist attraction now. They run tours. School groups." He set
the letter down. "They've turned it into a museum."

"It is a museum. It's history. Your history."

"I built it to carry cargo. Four hundred tons a day. That was the
spec. That was the whole point. A working system for getting mass to
orbit without rockets." He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes.
"And now they run tours."

Dorothy sat down across from him. She was seventy-three, her hair white,
her hands showing the work of a lifetime of gardening and grandchild-
wrangling, and her gaze was the same steady, unsentimental gaze that
had kept him sane through seven years of construction in equatorial
heat, three congressional hearings on cost overruns, and one terrifying
night when a coupling failed at the eighty-kilometer mark and the entire
lower section of the cable oscillated like a plucked guitar string for
nine hours while his team worked to bring it under control.

"You built the most important thing anyone has ever built," she said.
"Go see it again."

He went.

                               III.

The base station had changed.

Jack remembered it as a functional, no-nonsense facility — a concrete
platform, a cluster of prefabricated buildings housing the cable
tensioning equipment and the climber maintenance bays, a control tower,
a cafeteria that served terrible coffee and excellent chapati. It had
been built for utility, not aesthetics, because Jack Petersen did not
build for aesthetics. He built for load tolerances.

The base station was now a visitor center. The concrete platform had
been landscaped with gardens and walking paths. The prefabricated
buildings had been replaced with a graceful, curving structure of
glass and local stone that housed a museum, a gift shop, a restaurant,
and a theater where, presumably, a film about the elevator's
construction was shown on a regular schedule. There were benches. There
were informational plaques. There was a sculpture garden featuring
abstract representations of "humanity's reach for the stars."

Jack stood at the edge of the visitor center plaza and looked up.

The cable rose from the center of the platform, exactly where he had
placed it thirty-five years ago. It emerged from a housing unit that
was painted — painted! — a cheerful blue, and it ascended vertically,
narrowing with perspective, thinning to a line, thinning to a thread,
thinning to nothing as it climbed beyond the reach of the unaided eye.
The housing unit was decorated with a mural depicting the history of
spaceflight, from Goddard's first liquid-fuel rocket to the elevator
itself, rendered in bright primary colors that made Jack's teeth ache.

But above the mural, above the painted housing, above the visitor
center and the sculpture garden and the gift shop, the cable was the
same. It was still his cable — the same carbon nanotube composite, the
same cross-section, the same gentle taper, rising from one gravity to
zero with the mathematical inevitability that had been specified in his
original design documents. The same cable he had watched being extruded
from the orbital manufacturing platform, meter by meter, over the
course of three years. The same cable he had tested to destruction, run
to failure, loaded beyond spec, and rebuilt until it met every
tolerance, every margin, every criterion of safety and performance that
he had set.

It was still standing. The future had made it obsolete. It had not made
it fall down.

"Beautiful, isn't it?" said a voice beside him.

Jack turned. A young man stood next to him — mid-twenties, wearing the
khaki uniform of the Heritage Authority, with a name tag that read
KWAME and a pleasant, professional smile.

"I'm one of the guides," Kwame said. "Welcome to the Mombasa Space
Elevator Heritage Site. Is this your first visit?"

"In a manner of speaking."

"Wonderful. We have guided tours departing every thirty minutes.
The standard tour includes the base station museum, the original cable
tensioning gallery, and a climber ride to the twenty-kilometer viewing
platform. The extended tour continues to the orbital platform at
geosynchronous altitude. Would you like to—"

"I'd like to walk around on my own, if that's all right."

"Of course. The base station grounds are open access. If you'd like to
visit the tensioning gallery, it's through the main building, second
level. The original control room has been preserved as a period exhibit."

"Thank you."

Kwame nodded and moved on to the next visitor — a family with two
children who were staring up at the cable with their mouths open. Jack
watched the children for a moment. They were perhaps seven and nine.
The older one was trying to explain to the younger one how the cable
stayed up.

"It's because of gravity," the older child said, with the confident
authority of a nine-year-old. "The weight at the top pulls it tight,
like a string with a rock on the end."

The younger child looked dubious. "But what holds the weight up?"

"Gravity. Orbital gravity. It goes around and around and that keeps it
from falling."

"But what keeps it from falling?"

Jack almost intervened. He could have explained it — the counterweight
in geosynchronous orbit, the centripetal acceleration balancing the
gravitational pull, the cable in tension along its entire length, the
elegant physics that made an eighty-seven-thousand-kilometer structure
not merely possible but, once you understood the forces involved,
inevitable. He had explained it a thousand times, to engineers and
politicians and journalists and schoolchildren, and he could still do
it in his sleep.

But the older child was doing fine. And Jack had somewhere else to be.

                               IV.

The cable tensioning gallery was in the basement of the visitor center,
below ground level, in a space that Jack remembered as a working
machine room — loud, hot, smelling of lubricant and ozone, staffed
around the clock by technicians who monitored the cable tension and
adjusted the climber schedules and dealt with the thousand small
emergencies that a structure eighty-seven thousand kilometers tall
generated on a daily basis.

The room was a museum exhibit now. The original tensioning equipment
was still in place — the massive spools and dampeners, the hydraulic
compensators, the tension monitoring displays — but it was clean and
silent, lit by soft spotlights, separated from the visitors by velvet
ropes. Informational panels lined the walls, describing the function
of each piece of equipment in language that was accurate but slightly
oversimplified, the way museum panels always were.

Jack walked slowly through the gallery. He knew every piece of
equipment in it. He had specified most of it himself. The primary
tension compensator — a hydraulic system the size of a city bus that
absorbed the oscillations caused by wind loading and thermal expansion —
had been his design, developed over two years of testing and three
complete redesigns when the first two prototypes failed under load.

He stopped in front of the compensator and read the informational
panel.

"PRIMARY CABLE TENSION COMPENSATOR. This hydraulic system maintained
constant tension in the elevator cable despite variations caused by
weather, thermal expansion, and climber operations. Designed by Dr.
Jackson Petersen and his engineering team at the International Space
Cooperative, the compensator could absorb oscillations of up to 30
meters of lateral displacement — equivalent to the cable swaying 30
meters from vertical at ground level. The compensator operated
continuously for 12 years without a major failure, a testament to the
engineering excellence of the original design team."

Twelve years. Jack knew the number was correct — twelve years of
flawless operation, from completion in 2089 to decommissioning in 2101.
Twelve years was a good run for any piece of heavy machinery. It was an
excellent run for a piece of machinery that had no precedent in
engineering history.

But twelve years was not what he had designed it for. He had designed it
for fifty.

He had designed the entire elevator for fifty years of continuous
operation. Every component, every material, every system had been
specified with a fifty-year service life, plus a safety margin of
twenty percent. The cable itself was rated for at least seventy-five
years. The counterweight station was designed to be maintained and
upgraded indefinitely. The climbers were modular, replaceable,
improvable.

He had built it to last. And it had lasted — it was still standing,
still structurally sound, still capable of carrying cargo to orbit.
But it had been rendered unnecessary after twelve years by a technology
that Jack had not foreseen and could not have foreseen: the orbital
launch loop, a magnetically levitated track that circled the Earth at
low altitude and could accelerate payloads to orbital velocity at a
fraction of the elevator's cost.

The launch loop was better. It was cheaper. It was more efficient. It
made the space elevator — Jack's elevator, the work of his life — as
obsolete as a covered wagon on an interstate highway.

Jack stood in front of his own creation, preserved behind velvet ropes
in a museum he had never imagined, and he thought about covered wagons.

                               * * *

The control room was upstairs, behind a glass wall that allowed visitors
to look in without entering. It was exactly as Jack remembered it —
the horseshoe of consoles, the wall of monitoring displays, the large
central screen that had showed the cable's status in real time, every
sensor reading along its eighty-seven-thousand-kilometer length
displayed in a continuously updating cascade of data.

The consoles were dark now. The displays were blank. A placard on the
glass wall read: "ORIGINAL ELEVATOR CONTROL ROOM (2089-2101). This
room served as the nerve center of elevator operations. From these
consoles, controllers managed climber traffic, monitored cable health,
and responded to emergencies. At peak operations, the control room was
staffed by 14 controllers working in three shifts."

Jack pressed his hand against the glass. He could see his reflection
in it — a seventy-five-year-old man in a rumpled jacket, his hair
white, his face weathered, his shoulders still broad but beginning to
round forward in the way of old men who have spent decades leaning
over drafting tables and computer screens.

He could also see, through his reflection, the control room he had
spent seven years building toward and twelve years operating. He could
see the chair where he had sat during the first climber ascent, when
the entire team held its breath for nine hours while a cargo module
weighing fifty metric tons crawled up the cable at two hundred
kilometers per hour, every sensor reading watched, every vibration
analyzed, every tiny deviation from expected behavior evaluated and
either dismissed or flagged. He could see the console where Maria
Ochieng, his chief structural engineer, had worked through the night
during the coupling failure, her voice calm and precise over the
radio as she directed the repair team, her hands steady on the
controls while the cable oscillated and the wind howled and the
mathematics said they had a six-hour window before the oscillation
exceeded the cable's lateral tolerance and the whole thing came apart.

The cable had not come apart. Maria had been right about the fix. She
was usually right about the fix. She had died in 2095, six years after
the elevator's completion, of a heart attack at her desk at the ISC
headquarters in Nairobi. She was fifty-eight. Jack had delivered the
eulogy, and he had said the truest thing he knew about her: "Maria
built things that did not fall down. That was her gift, and it was
enough."

He took his hand off the glass. His palm had left a print on the
surface, the oils and ridges of a human hand, impermanent and specific.

He turned away from the control room and walked back outside, into the
equatorial sun.

                               V.

He found a bench near the base of the cable — not one of the visitor
center benches, with their informational plaques and their ergonomic
curves, but an old concrete bench that he recognized from the
construction days. It had been part of the original site furniture,
placed there for workers on their breaks, and it had survived the
renovation either by oversight or because someone had decided it was
quaint. It was positioned at the edge of the platform, close enough
to the cable housing that Jack could hear the faint, low hum of the
cable itself — not a mechanical sound, but the sound of wind passing
over a structure of immense length, a deep, barely audible vibration
that he had come to think of, during the construction years, as the
cable's voice.

He sat down. He took the acrylic block from his pocket and held it in
his lap. The sun was high and hot, the air thick with humidity, the
sky a deep equatorial blue that he remembered from years of working
outdoors in this latitude. The cable rose above him, impossibly thin,
impossibly tall, catching the light in a way that made it appear to
glow — a line of brightness drawn from the Earth to the sky.

He sat there for a long time.

He thought about the day they had completed the cable connection — the
day the orbital section, lowered from geosynchronous orbit over the
course of three years, met the ground section, raised from the surface
over the course of two years, and the two ends were joined. It was
2089. Jack was fifty-two. The connection was made at the sixty-
kilometer mark, in the stratosphere, by a team of engineers working in
pressure suits in temperatures of minus forty degrees. The actual
joining of the cable ends was performed by a robotic system that Jack
had designed — a collar mechanism that threaded the two cable sections
together and fused them using a process that involved precisely
controlled electrical resistance heating.

The fusion took fourteen seconds. Fourteen seconds, and the longest
structure in human history was complete.

Jack had been in the control room when the fusion was confirmed. Maria
was at the structural monitoring console. The numbers came in — tension
nominal, alignment nominal, cable integrity confirmed along the full
length — and the room erupted. People were shouting, embracing, some of
them crying. Someone produced a bottle of champagne that had been
hidden in a cabinet for this specific occasion.

Jack did not shout. He did not embrace anyone. He sat in his chair and
looked at the numbers on the screen, and what he felt was not triumph
but something quieter and more durable. Satisfaction. The satisfaction
of a problem solved, a design validated, a structure that stood because
the mathematics said it would stand and the materials performed as
specified and every bolt and weld and joint met its tolerance. He had
built what he set out to build, and it worked, and that was enough.

Maria had walked over to his console, champagne glass in hand, and
looked at him with an expression that combined affection and mild
exasperation.

"Jack. You're allowed to be happy."

"I am happy."

"You look like you're checking load specifications."

"I'm appreciating the load specifications. There's a difference."

She laughed and handed him the champagne. He drank it. It was warm and
too sweet, and it was the best thing he had ever tasted.

                               * * *

Now he sat on the concrete bench, twenty-three years after
decommissioning, thirty-five years after completion, and he held the
sample of cable in its acrylic block and he thought about what it meant
to build something the future outgrows.

It was not a new thought. He had been thinking it for twenty-three years,
since the day the ISC announced that the launch loop had rendered
cable-based orbital access systems economically nonviable, and the
elevator — his elevator — would be decommissioned. He had been in his
study in Dearborn when he heard the news, and he had sat very still for
a long time, and then he had gone downstairs and told Dorothy, and she
had held his hand and not said anything, because she was wise enough to
know that the situation did not require words.

He had not been angry. That surprised people when he told them. They
expected bitterness — the great engineer, supplanted by a better
technology, raging against the dying of his life's work. But Jack
Petersen had been an engineer for fifty years, and he understood something
about engineering that non-engineers often missed: the point of
engineering was not to build permanent things. The point of engineering
was to build things that worked, that solved the problem at hand, that
moved the species one step farther down the road. And when the next
solution came along — better, cheaper, more efficient — the proper
response was not anger but acknowledgment. You tipped your hat to the
new thing. You made room. You stepped aside.

The elevator had solved the problem of getting mass to orbit without
rockets. It had solved it for twelve years, during which time it had
carried approximately 1.7 million metric tons of cargo to geosynchronous
orbit — the building materials for three orbital stations, two
interplanetary vessel construction platforms, and the initial
infrastructure for the interstellar program. Without the elevator,
those things could not have been built, or could not have been built as
quickly, or could not have been built at the scale required.

Everything that humanity had accomplished in space since 2089 — every
mission, every colony, every ship — stood on the foundation the
elevator had provided. The launch loop was better, but the launch loop
had been developed by engineers who had worked on the orbital platforms
that the elevator had built. The interstellar program existed because
the elevator had made orbital construction affordable. The colonies
existed because the elevator had carried their first components into
the sky.

The elevator was the foundation. Foundations were not meant to be
admired. They were meant to be built upon.

                               VI.

A tour group was approaching — twenty or so visitors led by Kwame, who
was gesturing upward at the cable and delivering his narration with
practiced enthusiasm. Jack caught fragments as they passed.

"...tensile strength of 130 gigapascals, which means it could support
its own weight to a length of approximately 4,700 kilometers — far
more than necessary for the Earth-to-orbit application. The cable
tapers from a diameter of 1.2 meters at the geosynchronous point to
approximately 30 centimeters at the base, following a profile that
was optimized by Dr. Petersen's team to minimize total cable mass while
maintaining the required safety margins..."

Jack listened. The numbers were correct. The young man knew his stuff.

A woman in the tour group — middle-aged, wearing the practical clothes
and sensible shoes of a person who traveled frequently — raised her
hand. "You said it was decommissioned because of the launch loop. But
it's still structurally sound, isn't it? Why not keep it running as a
backup?"

"Great question," Kwame said. "The elevator is still structurally
sound — the Heritage Authority conducts annual inspections, and the
cable and counterweight are in excellent condition. The issue is
economic, not structural. Operating the elevator requires a full-time
staff of approximately two hundred people, plus ongoing maintenance of
the climber fleet and the orbital platform. The launch loop can deliver
the same cargo capacity at about three percent of the cost. So the
elevator is maintained, but not operated."

"Seems like a waste," the woman said.

"Some people think so," Kwame acknowledged. "Others see it differently.
There's a saying among the Heritage Authority staff: 'The elevator
was built to carry us to space. It succeeded. What more do you want
from a bridge?'"

Jack closed his eyes. He had not heard that saying before. He found
that he liked it very much.

The tour group moved on. The voices faded. The cable hummed its low,
wind-voice above him, and the sun was warm on his face, and the
concrete bench was as hard and unforgiving as it had always been, which
was how Jack Petersen liked his benches.

He opened his eyes and looked up at the cable. It rose from the
platform beside him, straight and true, exactly as he had specified,
exactly as he had built it. It would stand for decades yet — the
materials would last, the anchor would hold, the counterweight would
continue its patient orbit. Eventually, years from now, the cable
would be dismantled, the materials recycled, the site returned to
whatever it had been before Jack Petersen came along and drew a line
from the ground to the sky.

But not yet. For now, it stood. And people came to see it, and
children looked up at it with their mouths open, and guides explained
how it worked, and an old man sat on a bench at its base and remembered
the fourteen seconds when two ends of cable were joined in the
stratosphere and the longest structure in human history became real.

He put the acrylic block back in his pocket. He placed his hands on
his knees. He looked at the cable, and what he felt was not loss, not
regret, not the bittersweet melancholy of obsolescence. What he felt
was the same thing he had felt thirty-five years ago when the numbers
came in and the structure held and Maria handed him a glass of warm
champagne.

Satisfaction.

He had built it. It worked. The future had outgrown it, as the future
outgrows everything, and that was not a tragedy. That was the point.
You built the foundation. Someone else built the house. Someone else
built the house on top of that house. And someday, long after the
original foundation was forgotten, people lived in those houses and
looked out the windows at the stars, and they did not think about
foundations, because foundations did their work in silence.

That was enough.

Jack Petersen sat on his bench, at the base of his elevator, in the
warm equatorial sun, and he was content.

                               * * *

Dorothy called him that evening, on the hotel room's video screen. Her
face was familiar and beloved and slightly exasperated, the way it
always was when she thought he was being too quiet about something
important.

"Well?"

"It's still standing."

"I know it's still standing. How do you feel?"

He thought about it. "Good," he said. "I feel good."

"Good enough to come home?"

"I'm coming home tomorrow."

"Good. The gutters need cleaning."

"The gutters always need cleaning."

"That's because you designed them wrong."

He smiled. It was an old joke — the only engineering failure Dorothy
would ever hold against him, the gutters on their house in Dearborn
that clogged every autumn with leaves from the maple tree he had
refused to trim because it had been there before the house and would,
if left alone, be there after.

"I'll fix the gutters," he said.

"You'll clean the gutters. I don't want you redesigning them again.
The last time you redesigned them, you got a crane involved."

"It was a small crane."

"It was a crane, Jack. For gutters."

He laughed. She laughed. The connection was clear and warm, the distance
between Mombasa and Dearborn reduced to nothing by the same technology
that had made the world small and the universe large.

"I love you," he said.

"I know. Come home."

He went home. The gutters were waiting for him, and the maple tree, and
the workshop in the basement where he still kept a drafting table, even
though everything was done on computers now, because Jack Petersen
believed that an engineer who could not draw by hand could not truly see
what he was building.

On the drafting table, weighed down by the acrylic block containing
the cable sample, was a set of drawings he had been working on for the
past year. Not an elevator. Not a launch loop. Something new. Something
that no one had built yet, because no one had thought of it yet, or
because the materials didn't exist yet, or because the problem it
solved had not yet been recognized as a problem.

It was a foundation. A foundation for something that the future would
need. He did not know what would be built on it. That was not his
problem. His problem was the foundation.

He sat down at the drafting table. He picked up his pencil. He began
to draw.

The elevator stood in Mombasa, still and patient, humming its low note
in the equatorial wind. It would stand for a long time yet. And
somewhere in Dearborn, in a basement workshop that smelled of graphite
and machine oil, an old man was building the future again.

================================================================================

                          VANISHING ACT

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The magician's name was Marcus Fell, and he was the only person aboard
the generation ship Peregrine who did not have a useful skill.

This was not strictly true. He could palm a coin with either hand. He
could force a card from a deck of fifty-two with such naturalness that
even people watching for it could not detect the moment of manipulation.
He could produce a rabbit from an empty hat, though the ship's
ecological management team had asked him, firmly and repeatedly, to stop
doing this, as the rabbits were breeding stock and their temporary
disappearances caused inventory discrepancies that took hours to
resolve.

He could also, if the occasion demanded it, saw a woman in half.

But none of these skills appeared on the Peregrine's labor allocation
roster, which listed the 4,200 crew and passengers by their primary
function: agricultural technicians, environmental systems engineers,
medical personnel, educators, structural maintenance workers, data
analysts, and two hundred other categories of productive labor, each
one essential to the survival of a self-contained community traveling
between the stars at fourteen percent of the speed of light.

Marcus Fell's entry on the roster read: ENTERTAINMENT (PERFORMANCE
ARTS) — MAGIC/ILLUSION.

He had been assigned this designation by the Selection Committee
eighteen years ago, when the Peregrine was still under construction in
Earth orbit and the question of who would be allowed aboard was the
subject of the most contentious political debate in human history. The
committee had established a point-based system that weighted genetic
health, professional skills, psychological stability, age, and
reproductive potential. Marcus, who was twenty-two at the time, had
scored well on every metric except professional skills, where his
listed occupation — "stage magician" — had generated a brief but
vigorous argument among the committee members.

"We don't need a magician," one member had said.

"We need entertainment," another had countered. "Morale is a resource.
You can't sustain a closed community for a century without art, music,
storytelling, and yes, spectacle. He's a spectacle."

"He's a parlor trick."

"He's a very good parlor trick. And he scored ninety-seven on the
psychological battery. The man is unflappable."

Marcus had been allowed aboard. He had been aboard for eighteen years.
He had performed over a thousand shows. And he had never once been
asked the question that he sometimes asked himself, late at night, in
his small cabin on Deck Seven, when the ship's artificial night cycle
dimmed the lights and the hum of the Prometheus drive was the only
sound in the universe: What is the point of magic on a spaceship?

                               II.

The show was in the Peregrine's common hall — a large, multi-purpose
space on Deck Three that served as cafeteria, meeting room, gymnasium,
and performance venue. It could seat six hundred, which was roughly
fifteen percent of the ship's population, and Marcus performed there
every Saturday evening to a full house. People reserved seats weeks in
advance. There was a waiting list.

This had not always been the case. In the early years, when the ship
was new and the wonder of interstellar travel was fresh, attendance at
his shows had been sparse. People had better things to wonder at. They
could look out the observation windows and see the stars in their
native glory — not the dim, twinkling points visible through an
atmosphere, but the hard, brilliant, unwavering fires that burned in
the void. They could visit the ship's botanical garden, where
genetically modified plants from six continents grew in a hydroponic
cathedral of green light. They could explore the ship itself, which
was, in its way, the greatest engineering marvel in human history — a
self-sustaining world in miniature, carrying 4,200 human beings and
enough genetic diversity to seed a civilization.

Who needed a magic show?

But time had passed. Eighteen years of time, during which the
observation windows showed the same stars in the same configurations
(interstellar distances being too vast for any visible change in the
stellar positions over a mere eighteen years), and the botanical garden
had become as familiar as a backyard, and the ship's engineering had
faded from marvel to background, the way all technology fades when you
live with it long enough. The Peregrine was home now, not a wonder. And
home, however extraordinary its origins, eventually required
entertainment.

Marcus had adapted. In the early years, his act had been traditional —
the tricks he had learned on Earth, polished in the clubs and theaters
of New York before the Selection Committee changed his life. Card
tricks. Coin tricks. The cups and balls. The linking rings. A few
larger illusions, adapted for the ship's lower-than-Earth gravity
(0.85g, generated by the rotation of the habitation ring), which
required him to recalculate every throw, every toss, every drop.

But as the years passed and the audience became more sophisticated —
more familiar with the ship's technology, more aware of what was
physically possible in their enclosed world — Marcus had pushed his
act in new directions. He had to. These people lived surrounded by
technology that could do things that would have seemed miraculous to
anyone from the century before. The ship's fabrication systems could
produce any physical object from raw materials in minutes. The medical
bay could regrow a severed limb. The communication system could
transmit data across the void to Earth at the speed of light. In a
world where machines performed miracles daily, what could a man with
quick hands and a deck of cards offer?

The answer, Marcus had discovered, was not bigger tricks. It was
smaller ones. Closer ones. Tricks that happened right in front of you,
inches from your eyes, and still could not be explained.

Because that was the thing about magic. Real magic. Not the special
effects, not the technology, not the engineering. The thing that made
a person's breath catch and their eyes widen and their rational mind
stutter for one perfect moment. It was not about doing the impossible.
The ship did the impossible every day. It was about doing something
that looked impossible and was, in fact, accomplished by nothing more
than human skill — fingers and misdirection and years of practice and
a willingness to work harder at deception than the audience worked at
detection.

Magic was the last analog art. And aboard a digital ship, it was
irreplaceable.

                               III.

Tonight's show was special. It was the eighteenth anniversary of the
Peregrine's departure from Earth orbit — a date that the ship's
calendar committee had designated as Departure Day and that the
community celebrated with a feast, speeches, and a performance by
whoever the entertainment committee deemed appropriate. For the last
seven years, the entertainment committee had deemed Marcus appropriate.

The common hall was full. Six hundred people in their seats, the
overflow watching on screens in the corridors outside. Captain Reva
Singh was in the front row, as she always was on Departure Day, wearing
her dress uniform and the expression of controlled patience that she
wore at all official functions. Beside her sat Dr. Yuki Tanaka, the
ship's chief medical officer, and beyond her, a row of department heads
and senior staff.

Marcus stood backstage — a curtained area behind the raised platform
that served as the common hall's stage — and arranged his props. He did
this methodically, the way he did everything: deck of cards (two decks,
actually, one in the left jacket pocket, one in the right), three
steel rings, a silk handkerchief (red), a silk handkerchief (blue), a
glass tumbler, a small brass box, and a sealed envelope that he placed
at the center of the prop table with particular care.

The sealed envelope contained his notes for the final trick. The trick
he had been working on for three years. The trick that was either going
to be the greatest illusion ever performed, or something else entirely.

He did not know which. That was, he reflected, part of the appeal.

The house lights dimmed. The stage lights came up. Marcus straightened
his jacket — a black jacket, tailored by the ship's clothing
fabrication system to his exact measurements, because even in deep
space, a magician dressed the part — and walked onto the stage.

"Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. And welcome to the eighteenth
anniversary of the day we all made the questionable decision to get on
a spaceship and leave everything we knew behind."

Laughter. Warm, easy laughter. Eighteen years had turned the trauma
of departure into a shared joke, the way time turns most traumas into
shared jokes if you give it long enough.

"I'm Marcus Fell. I'm your magician. Some of you have seen this show
before. Some of you have seen it many times before. Mrs. Alvarez, I
see you in the third row — that's, what, two hundred shows?"

"Two hundred and fourteen," came a voice from the audience. More
laughter.

"Two hundred and fourteen. And she still can't figure out how I do the
cups and balls." He paused. "Neither can I, most of the time."

He began with the close-up work. Card tricks, performed with a deck
that had been shuffled by an audience member, each trick building on
the last, each one a little more impossible than the one before. A
chosen card appeared in a sealed glass jar. A signed card vanished and
reappeared inside an audience member's shoe. Four aces assembled
themselves from a shuffled deck with no visible manipulation.

The audience watched with the focused attention that Marcus had come to
depend on — the attention of people who were intelligent, educated, and
surrounded by technology, and who therefore appreciated, more than most
audiences would, the sheer improbability of what they were seeing. They
knew the cards were real cards. They knew the glass jar was a real
glass jar. They knew there was no technology at work — no holograms, no
nanobots, no fabrication tricks. Just a man with quick hands and
decades of practice.

That was the magic. Not the trick. The human being performing it.

He moved through his set. The linking rings — three solid steel rings
that passed through each other, clinked together, separated, reformed.
The silk handkerchiefs that changed color, multiplied, vanished, and
reappeared tied together in a chain that should have been too long to
fit in his closed fist. The brass box that, when opened, contained a
different object every time — a flower, a coin, a small mechanical bird
that sang three notes and then disappeared.

The audience applauded. They gasped. They laughed at his patter, which
was dry and self-deprecating and laced with references to shipboard
life that only people who had lived aboard the Peregrine for eighteen
years would fully appreciate. Marcus felt the familiar rhythm of a
good show — the call and response between performer and audience, the
rising wave of attention and delight that carried him through the
routine and set up what came next.

What came next was the final trick.

                               IV.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Marcus said, and his voice changed. The patter
dropped away. The humor was gone. What was left was quieter, more
serious, and the audience felt it instantly — a shift in register, a
change in the air.

"Eighteen years ago, we left Earth. We got on this ship and we
traveled into the dark, because someone — many someones — believed that
what was out there was worth reaching. We brought with us everything we
thought we would need: seeds and soil and machines and medicine and
knowledge and hope. We brought four thousand two hundred human beings,
each one carrying a lifetime of memory and experience and skill."

He paused.

"We also brought a magician. I'm still not sure why."

A ripple of laughter, but muted. They were listening.

"I've spent eighteen years trying to answer that question. Why magic?
What is magic for, in a world where technology can do anything? You can
fabricate any object in minutes. You can talk to Earth across the void.
You can regrow a hand. What can I possibly show you that your machines
can't do better?"

He picked up the sealed envelope from the prop table.

"This is my answer. This is the trick I've been working on for three
years. It is, if it works, the most ambitious illusion I've ever
attempted. It is also, possibly, the most dangerous, because I
genuinely do not know if I can pull it off."

He looked out at the audience. Six hundred faces looking back at him.
Captain Singh in the front row, her expression alert. Dr. Tanaka
beside her, arms folded.

"What I am going to attempt," Marcus said, "is to make this ship
disappear."

A beat of silence. Then a murmur — not laughter, not applause, but the
sound of four hundred people simultaneously recalibrating their
expectations.

"Not a model of the ship. Not a picture of the ship. The ship. The
Peregrine itself. All 1.2 million metric tons, all 4,200 people, all
eighty-seven decks. For one second. One single second, I am going to
make all of it vanish."

Captain Singh leaned forward in her seat. Marcus could see her
expression. It was the expression of a woman who commanded a generation
ship and did not appreciate surprises.

"Before anyone contacts security," Marcus said, "I want to be clear.
This is an illusion. It is a trick. There is no technology involved —
no manipulation of the ship's systems, no interference with navigation
or propulsion or life support. I have cleared this with the captain's
office." He looked at Singh. "The captain's office has expressed, let
us say, reservations."

Singh's expression did not change, but the corner of her mouth moved
approximately one millimeter.

"Here is what will happen," Marcus continued. "I will count to three.
On three, the lights in this hall will go out. For one second — exactly
one second, timed by the ship's chronometer — every light on the
Peregrine will go dark. Every screen. Every display. Every indicator.
For one second, there will be nothing. Complete darkness. Complete
silence. And in that one second, the ship will not exist."

He held up his hand.

"Of course it will exist. It will be right here, traveling at fourteen
percent of light speed toward Kepler-442b, exactly where it's supposed
to be. The life support will be running. The drive will be firing. The
hull will be intact. Nothing will actually change. But for one second,
in the dark, in the silence, you will not be able to prove it. For one
second, the evidence of your senses will tell you that you are nowhere,
in nothing, surrounded by void. And in that second, you will experience
something that no technology on this ship can provide."

He paused.

"Wonder."

He opened the envelope. Inside was a single card — an ace of spades,
the magician's card, the death card, the card of finality and
transformation.

"One second of wonder. That's all magic has ever been. Not the trick.
Not the method. The moment. The breath between what you expected and
what you got. The gap in your certainty. The space where the impossible
lives."

He held the card up.

"Ready?"

The audience was silent. Six hundred people, holding their breath.

"One."

He could feel the attention. Not just in the hall — throughout the ship.
The screens in the corridors were carrying the feed. People in their
cabins, in the agricultural bays, in the engine room, were watching.
The entire community of the Peregrine was watching a magician hold up
a playing card and count.

"Two."

He had coordinated with the ship's systems engineer — cleared it with
Singh, gotten authorization for a one-second blackout that would not
affect any critical system, that was, in technical terms, no more than
a scheduled lighting test with cosmetic additions. That was the
method. That was how the trick worked. It was simple. Embarrassingly
simple. A one-second blackout, timed to his countdown, dressed up with
patter about wonder and impossibility.

But the method was never the point. The method was never the point.

"Three."

The lights went out.

                               * * *

Darkness. Total, absolute, complete darkness — the kind of darkness
that does not exist on Earth, where there is always light leaking from
somewhere, always the glow of a city or a star or a screen. This was
the darkness of the void itself, the darkness between the stars, and
it was immense.

For one second, Marcus Fell stood in the dark, and the ship was gone.

Not gone. He knew it wasn't gone. He could feel the floor beneath his
feet, the faint vibration of the drive, the recycled air in his lungs.
The ship was there. The four thousand two hundred people were there.
The stars were outside the hull, and Kepler-442b was ahead of them,
and Earth was behind them, and everything was exactly as it had been
one second ago.

But in the dark, with every light extinguished and every screen black
and every sound absorbed by the sudden, shocking silence, the ship
did not feel like it was there. It felt like nothing was there. It
felt like the universe had paused — taken a breath — held it —

And in that breath, in that held moment, Marcus felt something that he
had not expected.

He felt the ship move.

Not the steady, constant acceleration of the drive. Something else. A
lurch. A shift. A displacement, as though the Peregrine had been
lifted — or dropped — or translated, in the mathematical sense,
from one position to another without traversing the space between.

It lasted less than a second. It was so brief that he could not be
certain it had happened at all. It might have been his imagination,
or his inner ear responding to the darkness, or the slight
disorientation that comes from standing in absolute blackness.

But he felt it.

And then the lights came back on.

                               V.

The audience erupted. Not with applause — not yet — but with sound:
gasps, laughter, exclamations, the release of six hundred held breaths.
The lights returned to their normal levels, the screens reactivated,
the familiar hum of the ship's systems resumed, and everything was
exactly as it had been before the darkness.

Almost exactly.

Marcus looked at the card in his hand. The ace of spades. He had been
holding it when the lights went out. He was still holding it. But it
was different. The card was different. Where the ace of spades had
been — the single black spade in the center of the card, the angular
pip, the familiar design — there was now a symbol he did not recognize.
It was intricate, asymmetric, and beautiful, like a snowflake rendered
by an alien geometry. It was not drawn. It was not printed. It was part
of the card, as though the card had always been this way.

He stared at it for two seconds. Then he pocketed the card, turned to
the audience, and bowed.

The applause broke like a wave. Six hundred people, on their feet,
clapping and shouting and laughing. Captain Singh was not applauding —
she was speaking rapidly into her communicator, her expression taut —
but Dr. Tanaka was clapping, and the department heads were clapping,
and in the corridors and cabins and agricultural bays, four thousand
two hundred people were talking about the darkness and the silence and
the one second when the ship had disappeared.

Had it disappeared? Of course not. It was a trick. A blackout, timed
to a countdown, dressed up with patter. The method was simple.

But the card in Marcus's pocket was not simple. And the lurch he had
felt in the darkness was not simple. And the navigational officer who
checked the ship's position logs after the show would find, and would
report to Captain Singh, and would spend the next several weeks trying
to explain, the fact that during the one-second blackout, the
Peregrine's position had shifted by exactly 1.7 kilometers — laterally,
instantaneously, with no corresponding acceleration, no energy
expenditure, and no physical mechanism that anyone aboard could
identify.

1.7 kilometers. In one second. In the dark.

Marcus Fell did not know this yet. He would learn it later, in a
meeting with the captain that would be tense and confused and ultimately
inconclusive. He would show her the card with its impossible symbol.
She would have it analyzed. The analysis would be inconclusive. He
would be asked, many times, how he had done it. He would answer,
honestly, that he had not done anything. He had turned off the lights.
That was all. The rest was not his trick.

Whose trick was it?

He did not know. He was a magician, not a physicist. He dealt in
appearances, not explanations. And the one thing he knew about magic —
the one thing that every magician knew, from the first street
performer who palmed a pebble in ancient Egypt to Marcus Fell, standing
on a stage on a ship between the stars — was that the explanation was
never as important as the moment.

The moment had been perfect.

He stood on the stage in the common hall of the Peregrine, the
applause washing over him, and he thought about the question he had
asked himself for eighteen years: What is the point of magic on a
spaceship?

And the answer, which had always been the answer, which was the only
answer that magic had ever had, was this:

The point is the wonder.

Not the explanation. Not the method. Not the technology that makes it
possible or the physics that says it's impossible. The wonder. The
breath. The moment when the world stops making sense and you are, for
one perfect instant, a child again, standing in the presence of
something you cannot explain and do not need to.

Magic is the space between what you know and what you feel. It is the
gap in the armor of certainty. It is the one-second darkness in which
anything is possible, and nothing is required, and the universe holds
its breath and waits for you to decide what to believe.

Marcus Fell took his bow. The audience cheered. The ship flew on
through the dark.

And in his pocket, the card with the impossible symbol waited, patient
and unexplained, like everything worth wondering about.

                         CHRISTMAS STAR

                     by Father Thomas Aquino

================================================================================

                               I.

The nova appeared on the twenty-second of December, and Father Michael
Corrigan was the first person on Bethesda Station to see it.

He was not looking for it. He was looking at the Orion Nebula, which he
did every evening after vespers, as a kind of private devotion that he
had never described to anyone and that he suspected would be difficult
to explain even if he tried. The nebula was visible from the station's
observation gallery — a long, curving corridor of reinforced
transparency on the outer ring of the habitat wheel — and it was, in
Father Corrigan's considered opinion, one of the most beautiful things
God had ever made.

He stood at the gallery window with his breviary closed in his hands
and his collar loosened — he had said the evening office alone, as he
often did, in the small chapel on Deck Four — and he looked at the
nebula. It was a vast cloud of gas and dust, illuminated from within by
the ultraviolet radiation of the young stars forming at its heart, and
it glowed with a light that was simultaneously cool and fierce, blue at
the edges and deep red-orange at the center, like a coal burning in a
cathedral of smoke.

He loved it. He loved it the way he loved the psalms — not with
understanding, exactly, but with a recognition that went deeper than
understanding. Something in the nebula's light spoke to something in
him, and what it said was older than language and more certain than
doctrine.

It was while he was looking at the nebula that the star ignited.

It was not dramatic. It was not an explosion — not in the cinematic
sense, not a flash or a burst. It was a brightening. A point of light
in the constellation Cassiopeia that had not been visible to the naked
eye a moment ago was now visible. Faintly at first, then more
definitely, then with a steady, clear brilliance that made it one of
the brightest objects in the sky.

Father Corrigan watched it brighten. He was not an astronomer — he was
a Jesuit priest with a degree in philosophy and a secondary
qualification in pastoral counseling — but he had lived on a space
station for six years and had absorbed, through osmosis and
conversation and the general atmosphere of scientific inquiry that
pervaded the station, enough astrophysics to recognize what he was
seeing.

A nova. A star dying — or rather, a star in a binary system shedding
its outer layers in a thermonuclear detonation, brightening by a
factor of tens of thousands in a matter of hours. The light he was
seeing had left the star centuries ago, perhaps millennia ago. The
event itself was ancient history. But to his eyes, standing at the
gallery window with his breviary in his hands, the star was being
born.

On the twenty-second of December. Three days before Christmas.

Father Corrigan was not a sentimental man. He was a Jesuit, and
Jesuits prided themselves on intellectual rigor, on the disciplined
application of reason to every question, including questions of faith.
He knew that the timing was a coincidence — that the universe did not
arrange its celestial mechanics to coincide with the liturgical
calendar of a small religious tradition on a small planet orbiting a
small star. He knew this.

But he smiled anyway. Because coincidence or not, the star was there.
And it was beautiful. And it was Christmas.

                               II.

Bethesda Station was a research platform in high Earth orbit, home to
approximately three hundred scientists, engineers, and support staff
from twenty-seven countries. It was named, with the dry humor that
characterized the International Space Cooperative's naming committee,
after the pool in the Gospel of John where an angel was said to trouble
the waters and heal the sick — a reference that was lost on most of the
station's secular population but that delighted Father Corrigan when he
first learned it.

He had been assigned to the station in 2047, at the request of the
ISC's Office of Crew Welfare, which had determined that a community of
three hundred people living in isolation for extended rotations would
benefit from the presence of a chaplain. The request specified "a
clergyperson of non-denominational sensibility," which, when translated
from bureaucratic language, meant someone who could minister to the
spiritual needs of a diverse community without proselytizing or causing
offense. Father Corrigan, with his Jesuit training, his philosophical
education, and his reputation for listening more than he spoke, had
been a natural choice.

He had expected to serve for two years. He was now in his sixth.

The station's population included Christians of various denominations,
Muslims, Jews, Hindus, Buddhists, two Sikhs, one Baha'i, one Jain,
one Zoroastrian, and a substantial contingent of atheists, agnostics,
and people who described their spiritual orientation as "complicated."
Father Corrigan served them all. He conducted Catholic mass on Sundays,
a non-denominational service on Wednesdays, and individual pastoral
sessions by appointment. He had officiated at weddings, memorial
services, and one circumcision (the latter requiring him to consult
extensively with a rabbi on Earth via delayed video link). He organized
an interfaith discussion group that met every Thursday evening and that
had, over six years, produced some of the most searching conversations
about God, meaning, and the cosmos that Father Corrigan had ever
participated in.

He was happy on the station. Happier, perhaps, than he had been at any
other posting. The isolation suited him. The routine of prayer and work
and conversation suited him. And the view — the constant, overwhelming,
humbling view of the stars — suited him in a way that he could only
describe as vocational. He had become a priest because he believed in
God. He had stayed on the station because, looking out at the universe
from a window in the void, he found it easier to believe.

Now he stood at the gallery window, watching a new star burn in
Cassiopeia, and he felt the familiar stirring that was, for him, the
closest thing to certainty that faith could offer. Not a voice. Not a
sign. Just a feeling — deep, quiet, undeniable — that the universe was
not empty, and that the light he was seeing was not accidental, and
that the question of whether it was meant for him was, perhaps, the
wrong question. The right question was whether he was paying attention.

He was paying attention.

                               III.

By morning, the station's astrophysics team had confirmed the nova and
designated it V2053 Cas. It was in the constellation Cassiopeia,
approximately 6,500 light-years from Earth, which meant the explosion
had occurred around 4500 BC — give or take a few centuries, depending
on measurement uncertainties. The light had been traveling for six and
a half millennia, crossing the void at the unremarkable speed of
300,000 kilometers per second, and had arrived at Bethesda Station on
the twenty-second of December, 2053.

"Classical nova," Dr. Adisa Okafor, the station's chief astronomer,
explained at the morning briefing. "White dwarf accreting material from
a companion star. The accumulated hydrogen ignites — a thermonuclear
runaway on the surface. Brightness increase of approximately ten
thousand fold. Apparent magnitude is roughly 1.3, which makes it one of
the brightest novae visible from Earth in several decades. Naked-eye
visibility will persist for approximately two weeks before it begins
to fade."

"Visible from Earth?" asked Commander Xiulan Zhou, the station's
commanding officer.

"Very much so. It's already been picked up by ground-based observatories.
The public announcement went out two hours ago. It's all over the news
feeds."

Father Corrigan, sitting at the back of the briefing room with his
coffee, listened to the astrophysicists discuss the nova in the
language of their discipline — luminosity curves, spectral classes,
ejecta velocities, nucleosynthesis. The language was precise and
beautiful in its precision, and it described the nova completely in
terms of physics. The white dwarf. The accretion disk. The
thermonuclear detonation. The expanding shell of gas and radiation.
Every aspect of the phenomenon could be measured, modeled, predicted.
There was no mystery. There was only physics.

And yet.

After the briefing, he walked to the galley and poured another cup of
coffee. Dr. Lena Hoffman, a German geologist who was one of the
regulars at his Thursday discussion group, was sitting at a table by
the window, looking out at the stars with an expression that Father
Corrigan recognized.

He sat down across from her. "You've seen it?"

"The nova? Yes. It's extraordinary." She paused. "Michael, I'm not a
religious person. You know this."

"I know this."

"But there is a new star in the sky, three days before Christmas, and
I cannot help feeling..." She trailed off.

"Feeling what?"

"Feeling that it means something. Which is absurd, of course. It
doesn't mean anything. It's a thermonuclear explosion on a white dwarf
6,500 light-years away. The timing is a coincidence."

"Is it?"

She looked at him sharply. "Are you going to tell me it's a sign?"

"No. I'm going to tell you that the feeling you're experiencing — the
feeling that it means something — is not absurd. It is, in fact, one
of the most profound and characteristic responses of the human mind to
the experience of beauty. You see a new star. You feel awe. The awe
suggests meaning. Whether the meaning exists in the star or in you —
that is a question I cannot answer. But the awe is real, and the awe
is worth paying attention to."

Lena was quiet for a moment. "You Jesuits always do that."

"Do what?"

"Answer a question with a better question."

Father Corrigan smiled. "It's in the training manual."

                               IV.

The idea came to him that afternoon, while he was preparing his homily
for the Christmas Eve mass. He had been planning to preach on the
Incarnation — the central mystery of Christmas, God becoming human,
the infinite entering the finite — but the nova had changed something
in his thinking, or rather had crystallized something that had been
forming for years.

He set aside his notes and went to find Commander Zhou.

The commander was in her office, reviewing crew schedules. She was a
compact, efficient woman in her fifties, with short gray hair and a
manner that was simultaneously warm and formidable. She was not
religious — she described herself as a "practical materialist" — but
she respected Father Corrigan and valued his contributions to crew
morale.

"Commander. I'd like to propose something for Christmas Eve."

"Go on."

"I'd like to hold a service. Not a Catholic mass — not a Christian
service of any kind. Something broader. An interfaith gathering. A
celebration."

"Of Christmas?"

"Of the nova."

Zhou raised an eyebrow. "The nova."

"A new star has appeared in the sky three days before Christmas. I
realize this is a coincidence. But it is also an opportunity. We have
three hundred people on this station, from twenty-seven countries,
representing at least a dozen spiritual traditions and many more who
claim no tradition at all. We have a new star. I would like to gather
the community and celebrate — not any doctrine, not any creed, but the
fact that we are here, in the void, looking at a universe that
continues to surprise us. The human capacity for awe. That is what I
would like to celebrate."

Zhou studied him for a moment. "You're suggesting a non-religious
religious service."

"I'm suggesting a gathering. A moment of shared attention. The content
would be drawn from every tradition represented on the station — I
would ask representatives of each tradition to contribute a reading, a
prayer, a song, a meditation. Whatever they feel is appropriate. The
focus would be the nova — the new star — as a point of common wonder."

"And for the atheists?"

"The atheists are welcome to wonder, too. I have met very few atheists
who are not capable of awe. The ones on this station are particularly
good at it. They just prefer to call it something else."

Zhou almost smiled. "When?"

"Christmas Eve. Twenty-one hundred hours. The observation gallery —
the view will be best there, and the nova will be directly overhead."

"I'll authorize it. But Michael — keep it inclusive. No sermons."

"Commander, I am a Jesuit. We have been keeping it inclusive since 1540.
It is practically our motto."

                               V.

He spent the next two days preparing.

He went to Dr. Okafor, who was Muslim, and asked for a reading from
the Quran about stars and creation. Okafor provided one: Surah An-Najm,
"The Star." "By the star when it descends, your companion has not
strayed, nor has he erred."

He went to Dr. Sharma, a Hindu astrophysicist, who offered a passage
from the Rig Veda — the Nasadiya Sukta, the Hymn of Creation.
"Whence all creation had its origin, the creator, whether he fashioned
it or whether he did not, the one who surveys it all from the highest
heaven, he knows — or perhaps he does not know."

He went to Lieutenant Goldberg, who was Jewish, and received a psalm —
Psalm 19, in Hebrew. "The heavens declare the glory of God, and the
firmament shows his handiwork."

He went to Mei-Ling Chen, a Buddhist environmental systems engineer,
who offered a passage from the Avatamsaka Sutra about the
interconnectedness of all things. "In each atom of the realms of the
universe, there exist vast oceans of world systems."

He went to the station's two Sikh engineers, who provided a passage
from the Guru Granth Sahib. "Wonderful is the Creation, and wonderful
is the Creator."

He went to Lena Hoffman, the geologist, the atheist, and asked her to
contribute something — anything — that expressed what she felt when she
looked at the stars. Lena thought about it for a day and then came back
with a passage from Carl Sagan: "The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium
in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were
made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff."

He went to everyone. He went to the station's Jain biologist, who
offered a meditation on the interdependence of life. He went to the
Baha'i engineer, who provided a prayer from Baha'u'llah. He went to
a young botanist from Okinawa who followed no tradition but who loved
poetry and offered a haiku by Basho: "Even in Kyoto — hearing the
cuckoo's cry — I long for Kyoto."

Father Corrigan collected these offerings the way a priest collects
the elements of a liturgy — carefully, respectfully, with an awareness
that each one carried the weight of a tradition and the sincerity of
the person offering it. He arranged them into a sequence that felt, to
him, like a conversation — a conversation between human beings who had
looked at the sky from different places and at different times and in
different languages, and who had all said, in their own way, the same
thing: We see you. We are amazed. We do not understand. Thank you.

                               VI.

Christmas Eve.

The observation gallery was dark, lit only by the stars. Father Corrigan
had asked the facilities team to extinguish the gallery's interior
lighting, and they had done so, leaving nothing between the three
hundred people gathered in the curved corridor and the universe outside
the transparency.

The nova was directly overhead, as he had promised. It burned in
Cassiopeia with a steady, clear light — not twinkling, not flickering,
but burning with the calm, fierce, unwavering brightness of a star
that had just announced itself to the cosmos. It was, by now, the
brightest object in the sky after the sun and the moon, and it cast
faint shadows on the gallery floor.

Father Corrigan stood at the center of the gallery, wearing his
clerical collar and a plain black suit, holding no notes. The
community was gathered around him — standing, sitting on the floor,
leaning against the windows. He could see their faces in the
starlight, and what he saw was attention. Three hundred faces, turned
toward him and toward each other and toward the window and the sky
beyond, and on every face, the same expression: expectation. The quiet,
open expectation of people who have come to witness something and do
not yet know what it is.

"Thank you for coming," he said. His voice was soft. In the gallery's
silence, it carried. "I am not going to preach to you tonight. I am
not going to explain the nova — Dr. Okafor has done that far better
than I could, and the physics is beautiful and does not need my help.
I am not going to tell you what the nova means, because I do not
know what it means, and I am not sure that 'meaning' is the right word
for what we are experiencing."

He looked up at the star.

"I am going to ask you to look at it. Just look at it. A new star,
burning in the dark. Light that has been traveling for six thousand
five hundred years, through the void, past dead stars and unborn
worlds, through distances that the human mind cannot truly comprehend
— and it has arrived here, tonight, at this window, for these eyes.
Your eyes. My eyes. Three hundred pairs of eyes, looking up."

He paused.

"I asked your colleagues to contribute something for tonight. A
reading, a prayer, a poem — something from their tradition, or from no
tradition, that speaks to what it means to be a human being looking at
a star. They were generous. They gave me more than I could use. I have
arranged their gifts into a kind of conversation, and I would like to
share it with you now. When each contributor is ready, they will speak
in their own voice, in their own words, in their own language. You do
not need to understand every word. You need only listen."

He nodded to Dr. Okafor, who was standing near the window with his
hands clasped.

Okafor spoke in Arabic, the words of the Quran rolling through the
dark gallery with a beauty that needed no translation. "Wan najmi
idha hawa, ma dalla sahibukum wa ma ghawa." By the star when it
descends, your companion has not strayed, nor has he erred.

Then Lieutenant Goldberg, in Hebrew: "Hashamayim mesaprim kevod-El,
uma'aseh yadav maggid harakia." The heavens declare the glory of God,
and the firmament shows his handiwork.

Then Dr. Sharma, in Sanskrit, the ancient words of the Rig Veda —
the Hymn of Creation, composed three thousand years ago by a poet
looking at the same sky. "Ko addha veda ka iha pra vochat, kuta ajata
kuta iyam visrishtih." Who truly knows? Who will here proclaim it?
Whence was it produced? Whence is this creation?

One by one, they spoke. The Sikh engineers, in Punjabi. Mei-Ling Chen,
in Mandarin. The Jain biologist, in Gujarati. The Baha'i engineer, in
Persian. The young botanist from Okinawa, in Japanese, Basho's haiku:
"Even in Kyoto — hearing the cuckoo's cry — I long for Kyoto."

And then Lena Hoffman, the geologist, the atheist, in English, her
voice slightly unsteady: "The nitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our
teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our apple pies were made
in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff."

The gallery was silent. Three hundred people in the dark, looking at
a star, having heard the words of a dozen traditions in a dozen
languages, all saying the same thing in different ways: We see. We
wonder. We do not understand. We are grateful.

Father Corrigan waited. He let the silence hold. The nova burned above
them, patient and bright and ancient and new.

Then he spoke one final time, and what he said was not a prayer and
not a sermon and not a benediction. It was simply what he felt, spoken
plainly, in the presence of the star.

"Whatever you believe — whatever tradition you carry, whatever doubts
you hold, whatever questions keep you awake at night — I want you to
know this: the capacity for awe that brought you here tonight is the
most sacred thing about you. Not your faith. Not your reason. Your awe.
The willingness to stand in the presence of something vast and
beautiful and say, simply, I do not understand, and I do not need to,
and I am grateful.

"That is enough. That has always been enough.

"Merry Christmas, my friends. And happy stargazing."

He stepped back. The silence held for a moment longer. Then someone
began to clap — softly, not as applause but as acknowledgment — and
others joined, and the sound spread through the gallery like a gentle
rain, and people turned to each other and embraced, and the nova
burned on above them, shedding its ancient light on a small station
in the void where three hundred human beings had gathered on Christmas
Eve to look at a star and feel, for a moment, that they were not
alone.

                               * * *

Afterward, in the galley, there was food and drink and conversation.
Someone had brought a guitar. Someone else had brought a bottle of
wine that Commander Zhou had authorized from the station's reserves.
People sat together — astrophysicists and engineers and botanists and
cooks, people of faith and people of no faith, people who had wept and
people who had simply listened — and they talked and laughed and sang
and looked out the galley windows at the nova, which burned on,
undimmed by their attention or their indifference.

Lena Hoffman found Father Corrigan in a corner, holding a cup of tea.

"That was not what I expected," she said.

"What did you expect?"

"I don't know. Something more... religious."

"That was the most religious thing I have ever done."

She looked at him. "You mean that."

"I do. I have spent my life studying theology, Lena. I have read the
Church Fathers, the scholastics, the mystics, the moderns. I have
celebrated thousands of masses and heard thousands of confessions and
preached hundreds of sermons. And the closest I have ever come to
understanding what I believe happened tonight, in that gallery. Three
hundred people looked at a star and felt awe. That is the raw material
of every religion and every philosophy and every work of art that
human beings have ever produced. The awe. The starting point. Before
doctrine, before theology, before argument — awe."

"And after awe?"

"After awe, people disagree. But the awe itself is universal. It is
the one thing we all share. The one common ground."

Lena was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "Merry Christmas, Father."

"Merry Christmas, Lena."

The nova burned on. The station turned slowly in its orbit. The Earth
hung in the darkness below, and the stars — old and new, near and far,
living and dead — filled the sky with a light that had been traveling
since before there were eyes to see it, since before there was a word
for beauty, since before there was a species capable of looking up and
wondering why.

Father Corrigan finished his tea. He walked to the chapel on Deck Four.
He knelt in the dark, in the presence of the tabernacle and the
stars, and he prayed. Not for understanding. Not for certainty. For
the one thing he had always prayed for, the one petition that had
never changed in forty years of priesthood:

Gratitude.

He rose. He went to bed. The nova burned on.

                            [THE END]

The trouble with visiting every possible future, Dr. Miriam Cates
reflected, was that it made the present feel underfurnished.

She sat in the anteroom of the Senate Committee on Temporal Affairs —
a beige, windowless room with plastic chairs, fluorescent lighting,
and a water cooler that produced a faint, asthmatic gurgle every
ninety seconds — and she thought about the palace she had visited
last Tuesday. Or rather, last Tuesday from her personal timeline,
which corresponded to a Thursday in the year 2847 on Timeline Sigma-7,
where humanity had colonized fourteen star systems and built a seat of
government out of crystallized light and good intentions. The palace
floated above a violet ocean. Its walls were transparent. Its
inhabitants were kind.

It had lasted forty-three years before a trade dispute escalated into
a war that reduced the palace, the ocean, and the planet it sat on to
a cloud of irradiated debris.

She had visited the debris, too. That was Timeline Sigma-7a. Same
universe, different branch. The palace had existed, and then it hadn't,
and the difference between the two branches was a single vote in a
single committee meeting — a vote that, in Sigma-7, went one way, and
in Sigma-7a, went the other.

One vote. One future. One palace. One cloud of debris.

And now she was sitting in a beige room in 2053, waiting to testify
before a Senate committee about what she had seen, and the water
cooler was making its asthmatic noise again, and the fluorescent light
above her head was flickering in a way that suggested a failing
ballast, and she was thinking: I have been to the end of the universe
and back, and I am waiting in a room with plastic chairs.

This was, she supposed, the present's way of keeping her humble.

                               II.

The committee room was more impressive than the anteroom, but only
slightly. It was a large, wood-paneled chamber with a raised dais at
one end where the senators sat, a long table at the other end where
the witnesses sat, and rows of seats in between for the press, the
public, and the various staffers, lobbyists, and hangers-on who
populated the corridors of power like remora on a shark.

Senator Patricia Halloran, the committee chair, called the hearing to
order. She was a compact, sharp-eyed woman from New Hampshire who had
been described by one journalist as "the only person in Washington who
can make time travel boring," a characterization that Miriam considered
unfair. Halloran wasn't boring. She was methodical. She asked
questions, she listened to answers, and she did not tolerate evasion.
In a city built on evasion, this made her seem dull.

"Dr. Cates," Halloran said, "you have been designated by the
International Temporal Research Institute as their lead observer. Is
that correct?"

"It is, Senator."

"And in that capacity, you have made — how many temporal excursions?"

"Three hundred and twelve."

A murmur from the gallery. Three hundred and twelve was a large number.
It was, in fact, the largest number of temporal excursions any human
being had ever made, and it was the reason Miriam's hair had gone white
at forty-one and her left hand trembled slightly when she was tired and
her dreams were a kaleidoscope of futures that she could not always
distinguish from each other or from the present.

"Three hundred and twelve visits to alternate timelines," Halloran
repeated, for the record. "Covering a range of how many years?"

"The earliest timeline I visited was set approximately two hundred
years in the future. The latest was set approximately ten thousand
years in the future."

"And the purpose of these visits?"

"Observation. Assessment. The Institute's mandate is to observe
possible futures and report on their characteristics — their social
structures, their technologies, their challenges, their failures.
The purpose is to provide information that may be useful in shaping
policy in the present."

"In other words, you visit the future to help us make better decisions
today."

"That is the hope, Senator."

Halloran looked at her over the tops of her reading glasses. "And in
three hundred and twelve visits to the future, Dr. Cates, what have
you learned?"

Miriam paused. This was the question she had been preparing for. It
was also the question she had been dreading, because the honest answer
was complicated, and Congress did not like complicated answers. Congress
liked answers that fit on a bumper sticker.

She took a breath.

"Senator, I have learned that every tomorrow is worth reaching."

                               III.

She had not always believed this. In the early days of her work at the
Institute — when the temporal displacement technology was new and the
protocols were still being developed and each excursion was an
adventure into the genuinely unknown — she had been an optimist. She
had expected to find, in the future, evidence of progress: better
societies, better technologies, better people. She had expected the
arc of the moral universe to bend, as the saying went, toward justice.

The first dozen excursions had confirmed this expectation. She visited
a timeline set three hundred years hence where poverty had been
eliminated and every human being had access to education, healthcare,
and meaningful work. She visited a timeline where faster-than-light
travel had opened the galaxy to exploration and humanity had
established peaceful contact with seven intelligent species. She
visited a timeline where the environmental catastrophes of the twenty-
first century had been reversed by a massive, coordinated effort that
restored the oceans, the forests, and the atmosphere to preindustrial
health.

Progress. Real, measurable, undeniable progress. She had come home
from these excursions elated, her reports glowing, her faith in
humanity's potential reinforced by evidence.

Then she visited Timeline Gamma-12.

Gamma-12 was a dystopia. Not a dramatic dystopia — not a
totalitarian nightmare or a post-apocalyptic wasteland, but a quiet,
grinding, banal dystopia in which humanity had simply... stalled. The
technology was advanced. The population was healthy. The cities were
clean. But the society was frozen. Innovation had stopped. Art had
stopped. Exploration had stopped. People lived long, comfortable,
utterly static lives in a civilization that had achieved everything
it set out to achieve and then discovered that achievement, without
the drive to achieve more, was a form of death.

She had walked through the streets of a city on Gamma-12 — a beautiful
city, perfectly maintained, every building in ideal repair — and she
had felt a chill that had nothing to do with the temperature. The
people she passed were polite, healthy, well-dressed, and empty. They
had everything. They wanted nothing. They were, in the deepest sense
of the word, finished.

She came home from Gamma-12 shaken, and for the first time, she
wondered if the arc of the universe bent toward anything at all.

                               * * *

After that, she visited dystopias. Not deliberately — the Institute's
timeline selection was semi-random, governed by algorithms that
targeted regions of the temporal probability space — but frequently
enough that she began to wonder if dystopias were the norm and
utopias the exception.

She visited a timeline where a pandemic had killed ninety percent of
the human population and the survivors had rebuilt a society based on
rigid genetic screening that was indistinguishable from eugenics. She
visited a timeline where artificial intelligence had surpassed human
intelligence and had, without malice and without even particular
interest, reorganized human civilization to maximize efficiency in
ways that left no room for freedom, creativity, or dissent. She
visited a timeline where humanity had destroyed itself in a nuclear
exchange and the Earth was an irradiated ruin inhabited by
cockroaches and extremophile bacteria.

She came home from each excursion and wrote her reports with the
precise, brisk prose that was her professional voice, and she
presented her findings to the Institute, and she went back out.
Three hundred and twelve times. Three hundred and twelve futures.

And what she had learned — what she was about to tell the Senate
committee, if she could find the words — was this:

Every tomorrow was worth reaching. Not because every tomorrow was good.
Many of them were terrible. Not because every tomorrow represented
progress. Many of them represented catastrophic regression. Not
because the future was guaranteed to be better than the present. It
wasn't. The future was not guaranteed to be anything.

Every tomorrow was worth reaching because the act of reaching it was
the point.

                               IV.

"Let me tell you about Timeline Delta-9," Miriam said.

The senators leaned forward. The press gallery rustled. The staffers
stopped texting.

"Delta-9 is set approximately four hundred years in the future. In
Delta-9, the Earth experienced a catastrophic environmental collapse
in the late twenty-first century — runaway climate change, ocean
acidification, mass extinction, the usual menu of horrors. By 2150,
the global population had fallen to approximately 800 million. By 2200,
it had fallen to 200 million. Civilization, as we understand the term,
had collapsed."

She paused.

"And then it came back."

She let the words settle.

"The survivors of the collapse did not give up. They did not retreat
into despair or barbarism. They rebuilt. Slowly, painfully, over the
course of two centuries, they rebuilt. They developed new agricultural
techniques adapted to the changed climate. They created new social
structures based on the hard lessons of the collapse. They restored
ecosystems that had been destroyed, species by species, habitat by
habitat. It took them two hundred years, and the civilization they
built was not the same as the one that had collapsed — it was smaller,
simpler, more cautious. But it was alive. It was growing. It was
reaching."

She looked at the senators.

"When I visited Delta-9, four hundred years after the collapse, I found
a civilization that was launching its first spacecraft. Not fusion-
powered starships — simple, chemical-rocket orbital vehicles, the kind
we flew in the twentieth century. They were starting from scratch. They
were behind us by centuries. And they were the happiest, most vital,
most hopeful people I have ever met. Because they had earned their
tomorrow. They had come through the worst thing that could happen and
they had survived, and the act of survival had given them something
that no amount of prosperity or technology could provide: the knowledge
that tomorrow was not guaranteed, and that this made it precious."

Senator Halloran removed her reading glasses. "Dr. Cates, are you
telling this committee that the best future you've seen is one that
went through a catastrophe first?"

"No, Senator. I am telling this committee that I have visited three
hundred and twelve futures, and the ones that succeeded were not the
ones that avoided problems. They were the ones that faced problems and
refused to be destroyed by them. I have seen utopias that crumbled
because they had nothing to struggle against. I have seen dystopias
that blossomed because the people living in them refused to accept that
the story was over."

"That's a very poetic answer, Dr. Cates. Can you give us something
more concrete?"

Miriam smiled. She had been waiting for this question.

"Concrete. Yes. Here is something concrete, Senator. I have visited
three hundred and twelve possible futures. In every single one of
them — every utopia, every dystopia, every middling muddling-along
timeline where things were neither wonderful nor terrible — in every
single one, human beings were still asking the same questions. Is this
right? Can we do better? What happens next? In not one future — not one
out of three hundred and twelve — had humanity stopped asking. Even in
the frozen civilization of Gamma-12, where everything had stalled and
the streets were beautiful and empty, there was a woman in a library
who was writing a manifesto about why things needed to change. Even in
the radioactive wasteland of Theta-3, where the cockroaches had
inherited the Earth, the last surviving human settlement was teaching
its children to read."

She leaned forward.

"That is what I have learned, Senator. Human beings do not stop reaching.
We cannot. It is what we are. We are the species that asks 'what next?'
and then goes to find out. Sometimes the answer is wonderful. Sometimes
it is terrible. But the asking — the reaching — the refusal to accept
that this moment is the last moment and this place is the last place —
that is the constant. That is the through-line in every future I have
visited. And that is why every tomorrow is worth reaching. Not because
the destination is guaranteed. Because the journey is who we are."

                               V.

Senator Wallace, the ranking minority member — a large, skeptical man
from Georgia who had been described, unkindly but accurately, as "the
Senate's designated wet blanket" — cleared his throat.

"Dr. Cates, this is all very inspiring. But I have to ask: if every
future is worth reaching, does that mean we shouldn't bother trying to
steer? Should we just sit back and let whatever happens happen?"

"No, Senator. Absolutely not. The futures I've visited are not
inevitable. They are possibilities. The whole point of temporal
observation is to identify the choices that lead to better outcomes
and the choices that lead to worse ones. We can steer. We should steer.
What I am saying is that even when we steer badly — even when we make
the wrong choices and the future is not what we hoped — the act of
continuing to steer, the refusal to give up, is itself the thing that
matters."

"So the message is: try hard, but don't worry if we fail?"

"The message is: try hard. Fail sometimes. Try again. And never,
under any circumstances, stop trying. Because the only future that is
truly not worth reaching is the one where we stop."

Wallace leaned back. "Dr. Cates, have you seen that future? The one
where we stop?"

Miriam was quiet for a moment.

"Once," she said. "Timeline Omega-1. I visited it on my two hundred
and forty-seventh excursion. It was set approximately six thousand
years in the future."

"And?"

"There was nothing there. Not a wasteland. Not a ruin. Nothing. No
humans. No artifacts. No evidence that we had ever existed. The planet
was healthy — forests, oceans, wildlife. But we were gone. Completely
gone. Erased. Not by war, not by plague, not by catastrophe. We had
simply... stopped. Given up. Let go. The species had collectively
decided that the effort of existence was not worth the trouble, and
it had ceased to exist."

The committee room was very quiet.

"That is the only future I have visited," Miriam said, "that I would
describe as not worth reaching. And the reason it was not worth
reaching is that no one was reaching. That is the difference. That is
the only difference. Reach, and the future is yours — messy,
imperfect, surprising, terrifying, beautiful, and alive. Stop reaching,
and there is nothing."

She looked at the senators. She looked at the press gallery. She
looked at the staffers and the lobbyists and the hangers-on.

"Every tomorrow is worth reaching," she said. "That is my testimony.
That is what I have learned in three hundred and twelve visits to the
future. The future is not a destination. It is an act of will. It is
the decision, made fresh every morning by every human being who gets
out of bed and faces the day, that the story is not over. That there
is more to see. That the next page is worth turning."

She paused.

"Turn the page, Senators. It's a good book."

                               * * *

The hearing concluded at 4:47 PM. Senator Halloran thanked the witness.
The press filed their stories. The staffers resumed texting.

Miriam Cates walked out of the committee room and into the corridor,
where the fluorescent lights still flickered and the water cooler
still gurgled and the present was, as always, stubbornly,
magnificently, infuriatingly present.

She stood in the corridor for a moment. Through a window at the end
of the hall, she could see the sky — the December sky, gray and cold,
the sun already low. Not the violet ocean of Sigma-7. Not the
crystallized palace. Not the green forests of Delta-9 or the frozen
streets of Gamma-12 or the emptiness of Omega-1. Just the sky. The
real, present, unvisited, undetermined sky of right now.

She had been to three hundred and twelve tomorrows. She had seen the
best and the worst that humanity could become. And here she was, back
in today, standing in a corridor with bad lighting, and the future was
still unwritten, and the page was still unturned, and the story was
still going.

She put on her coat. She walked outside. The December air was sharp
and clean. Somewhere in the city, bells were ringing — church bells,
perhaps, or clock bells, or just the sound that cities make when they
are alive and busy and full of people who have not yet decided what
tomorrow will look like.

She walked toward the sound.

Every tomorrow was worth reaching. She had seen three hundred and
twelve of them, and she was certain.

Tomorrow was worth reaching. And the one after that. And the one after
that.

All of them.

All the tomorrows.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                            HOMEPORT

                      by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

Christmas Eve at Armstrong Spaceport was the busiest night of the year,
and Maggie Flynn was stuck behind the customs desk with a line that
stretched to the departure lounge and a coffee machine that had died
at six o'clock.

The coffee machine was the real problem. Maggie could handle the line.
She'd been handling lines for eleven years — eleven years of checking
manifests, stamping passports, running cargo scans, and asking the
same questions in the same order to an endless parade of pilots,
passengers, engineers, mechanics, merchants, and the occasional
confused tourist who had wandered into the wrong terminal. She could
do it in her sleep. She very nearly was doing it in her sleep, because
her shift had started at 0400 and it was now 1830 and the line was not
getting shorter.

But without coffee, she was operating on fumes and stubbornness, and
the stubbornness was wearing thin.

"Next," she said.

A pilot stepped up to the desk. He was maybe fifty-five, with a face
that had been weathered by too many decompression cycles and not enough
sunscreen — deep lines around the eyes, skin like old leather, hands
that were large and capable and slightly trembling in the way that
hands trembled after a long burn. He wore a flight jacket with the
insignia of Consolidated Freight on the shoulder and the name KOWALSKI
stitched over the breast pocket.

"Captain Kowalski," Maggie said, pulling up his record. "Consolidated
Freight, vessel registration CF-7714, the... Perseverance."

"That's right."

"Cargo manifest?"

He handed her the datapad. She scanned it — industrial equipment,
machine parts, prefabricated habitat components, seventeen crates of
frozen embryonic livestock destined for the Titan agricultural station.
Standard stuff. Nothing flagged.

"Where from?"

"Ceres. Way station at Vesta. Final approach from lunar orbit."

"Long trip."

"Forty-three days." He rubbed his eyes. "Forty-three days, and I'm
supposed to be home for Christmas dinner. My daughter's cooking. God
help us all."

Maggie almost smiled. "Business or personal visit to Armstrong?"

"Last run, actually." He said it quietly, without drama. "Thirty years
hauling freight. This is the last one. I'm hanging it up."

She looked at him. Thirty years. She'd seen a lot of pilots come
through Armstrong, and the ones who lasted thirty years had a look
about them — a weariness that went deeper than fatigue, a patience
that had been earned by long hours in the black. Kowalski had that
look.

"Congratulations, Captain."

"Thanks. Now if you could stamp that manifest so I can get to my
daughter's place before the turkey dries out, I'd be much obliged."

She stamped it. "Merry Christmas, Captain. And happy retirement."

He tipped an imaginary hat and walked toward the exit, a big man in
a worn flight jacket, carrying nothing but a duffel bag and thirty
years of stories.

Maggie watched him go. Then she looked at the line, which had not
gotten any shorter.

"Next," she said.

                               II.

On the maintenance level, three floors below the passenger terminal,
Eddie Vasquez was lying on his back under the belly of a Hawker-Singh
orbital shuttle, trying to replace a fuel injector with fingers that
were numb from cold and greasy from twelve hours of continuous work.

The shuttle — registration number OS-441, nickname "Lucky Girl,"
though there was nothing particularly lucky about her — was due to
launch at 0600 on Christmas morning with a load of medical supplies
for the Mars transfer station, and her starboard engine had decided,
with the timing of a seasoned comedian, to develop a fuel leak at
1400 on Christmas Eve.

Eddie had been on shift since 0600. He had eaten a sandwich at noon,
drunk four cups of coffee (from a machine that, unlike Maggie Flynn's,
was still operational), and spent the last six hours disassembling,
inspecting, cleaning, and reassembling the fuel delivery system of an
engine that was, by any honest assessment, ten years past its service
life and running on accumulated stubbornness.

"You're a stubborn old girl, aren't you?" he said, to the engine.
The engine did not reply. Engines never did, in Eddie's experience,
which was extensive and hard-earned.

He was twenty-eight. He had been a mechanic at Armstrong for five
years, having graduated from the ISC's technical training program at
twenty-three with a specialization in reaction engine systems and a
student debt that would take him until approximately the heat death of
the universe to pay off. He was good at his job. He was not fast — the
senior mechanics could strip and rebuild a Hawker-Singh fuel system in
four hours; Eddie took six — but he was thorough, and thoroughness,
in the opinion of the maintenance supervisor, was more important than
speed when you were working on systems that kept people alive in
vacuum.

"Eddie!" A voice from above. He slid out from under the shuttle and
looked up. Kenji Moto, the night shift supervisor, was standing at the
edge of the maintenance bay with a clipboard and an expression that
suggested he had bad news.

"Yeah?"

"Bay Four needs you when you're done with Lucky Girl. The Constellation-
class in there has a cracked reaction chamber liner."

"You're kidding."

"I am not kidding. It's Christmas Eve and every ship in the system
is trying to get somewhere. We've got six overdue departures, three
emergency maintenance holds, and I just lost Martinez to a stomach
bug."

"What about Okonkwo?"

"Okonkwo's on the Titan freighter. Heating coil replacement. She'll
be there till midnight."

Eddie looked at the fuel injector in his hand. He looked at Kenji. He
thought about his apartment, which was empty and cold because his
girlfriend had gone to visit her family on the Moon and he had
volunteered for the holiday shift because someone had to, and because
the ships didn't care what day it was.

"Yeah," he said. "All right. Give me two hours on Lucky Girl and I'll
move to Bay Four."

"You're a good man, Eddie."

"I'm a tired man, Eddie. There's a difference."

He slid back under the shuttle. The fuel injector was a small, precise
piece of engineering — a ceramic cylinder with micro-machined orifices
that atomized the fuel into a spray pattern optimized for the engine's
combustion geometry. It had to be seated perfectly. A misalignment of
less than a millimeter could cause an asymmetric burn, which could
cause a thrust imbalance, which could cause — in the worst case — a
very bad day for whoever was sitting in the cockpit.

Eddie seated the injector. He torqued the mounting bolts to spec —
thirty-two newton-meters, no more, no less. He connected the fuel
lines. He ran the diagnostic sequence. The numbers came back clean.

"That's one," he said, to no one. Then he moved to Bay Four.

                               III.

In Terminal B, a girl named Sasha Park, who was seven years old, saw a
spaceship for the first time.

She had seen pictures, of course. Everyone had seen pictures. The
newsfeeds were full of pictures of ships — sleek, silver, gleaming
against the black of space, arriving at distant moons and faraway
stations and places with names that sounded like they belonged in
storybooks. But pictures were flat, and ships were not flat. Ships
were enormous.

The ship she was looking at through the terminal's observation window
was a Constellation-class heavy transport, docked at Berth Seven,
and it filled the window from edge to edge. It was two hundred meters
long, its hull a patchwork of thermal plating and sensor arrays and
access panels and the subtle scars of micrometeorite impacts, and it
was the most beautiful thing Sasha had ever seen.

"Mom," she said. "Mom. Look at it."

Her mother was sitting in one of the terminal chairs, surrounded by
luggage, trying to get the departure information screen to display
something other than an error message. "I see it, sweetheart."

"No, Mom. Look at it."

Her mother looked up. The ship was right there, on the other side of
the window, close enough that Sasha could see the individual bolts
on its docking clamps and the frost condensation on its coolant lines
and the faded letters of its name — NORTHERN PASSAGE — painted on the
hull in a typeface that was practical and unromantic and somehow
perfect.

"It's big," her mother said.

"It's beautiful," Sasha said.

"It's a freight hauler, honey. It carries machine parts."

"It goes to the stars."

"It goes to Jupiter. That's not the stars."

"It's closer to the stars than we are."

Her mother smiled. It was the particular smile of a parent who
recognizes, in a child's certainty, something that cannot be argued
with and should not be. "You're right," she said. "It is closer to
the stars."

Sasha pressed her face against the window. The ship was being serviced
— she could see the maintenance crawler moving along its hull, its
robotic arms inspecting the thermal plating, its lights blinking in a
rhythm that looked, to Sasha, like a heartbeat. The ship was alive.
Not alive the way she was alive, but alive the way a house was alive
when there were people in it and the lights were on and dinner was
cooking — alive because it had a purpose, and its purpose was to go.

She was seven years old, and she had just decided what she wanted to
be when she grew up.

She wanted to go.

                               IV.

At 2100 hours, the spaceport chapel held its Christmas Eve service.

The chapel was small — a converted storage room on the mezzanine level,
with folding chairs, a portable altar, and a window that looked out
onto the departure concourse. It was non-denominational, as all
spaceport chapels were, decorated with symbols from a half-dozen
traditions and presided over by a rotating cast of volunteer
chaplains who came and went with the transit schedule.

Tonight's chaplain was a retired naval officer named Grace Washington,
who had been a Methodist minister before she was a commander and who
approached both vocations with the same brisk, compassionate
efficiency. She wore a clerical stole over her flight jacket and
conducted the service with the easy authority of someone who was
accustomed to commanding attention in difficult circumstances.

The congregation was small — perhaps twenty people, most of them
spaceport staff who had an hour between shifts, plus a handful of
travelers waiting for delayed departures. Captain Kowalski was there,
having missed his daughter's turkey after all — his surface-to-ground
shuttle had been delayed by a maintenance hold, and he was spending
Christmas Eve in the spaceport instead of at the family table. He sat
in the back row, his duffel bag at his feet, and he sang the hymns in
a deep, slightly off-key baritone that was, Grace Washington decided,
one of the most beautiful sounds she had ever heard.

Eddie Vasquez was not there. He was in Bay Four, replacing a cracked
reaction chamber liner. But he could hear the hymns faintly through
the ventilation ducts, and he hummed along while he worked.

Maggie Flynn was not there either. She was still at the customs desk.
But her line had finally shortened to a manageable length, and someone
had brought her a cup of coffee from the staff lounge, and the coffee
was hot, and the night was half over, and Christmas was almost here.

Sasha Park was asleep in a terminal chair, her head on her mother's
shoulder, dreaming of ships.

                               V.

At midnight, the spaceport's public address system chimed, and a voice
— warm, slightly formal, the voice of the automated announcement
system that had been programmed, someone had decided, by a person with
a sense of occasion — said:

"Attention, please. Armstrong Spaceport wishes all travelers, crew,
and staff a merry Christmas. Current departures: Mars transfer shuttle
Ares-7, Gate 14, now boarding. Titan supply vessel Northern Passage,
Berth Seven, departure 0200. Lunar shuttle Copernicus, Gate 3,
departure 0330. All other scheduled departures proceeding normally."

The announcement echoed through the terminal, through the maintenance
bays, through the customs hall, through the chapel where Grace
Washington was saying a final prayer, through the observation window
where the Northern Passage sat in its berth like a patient horse
waiting to be saddled.

And in a dozen places throughout the spaceport, a dozen people heard
it and looked up.

Kowalski heard it in the chapel and thought about thirty years of
Christmas Eves spent in space — cold ones, lonely ones, scary ones,
and a few that were warm and bright and close to something like peace.
This was his last one in a spaceport. After tonight, Christmas would
be on the ground, at a family table, with his daughter's cooking and
his grandchildren's noise. He was ready for that. He was ready to stop
moving.

But he would miss this. The hum of the spaceport. The rumble of
engines. The feeling of being at the crossroads of everywhere, the
place where all the journeys started and all the journeys ended. He
would miss it the way you miss a friend who moved away — not with
grief, but with a fond, persistent ache.

Eddie heard it in Bay Four and tightened the last bolt on the reaction
chamber liner and ran the diagnostic and watched the numbers come back
clean and said, "That's two," and wiped his hands on a rag and looked
at the clock and thought: I should call my mom.

Maggie heard it at the customs desk and stamped the last manifest in
her queue and looked at the empty line and allowed herself a small,
private smile. The line would be back in the morning. The line was
always back in the morning. But for now, for this moment, the desk
was clear and the coffee was hot and Christmas was here.

Sasha heard it in her sleep and stirred, and her mother smoothed her
hair and whispered, "Merry Christmas, baby," and Sasha smiled without
waking and dreamed on, dreaming of ships and stars and the vast, dark,
beautiful distances between them.

Grace Washington heard it in the chapel, after the last congregant had
gone, while she was folding the altar cloth and putting away the
hymnals. She paused, listened, and then said, to the empty chapel, to
the window, to the ships and the stars and the people who traveled
between them:

"Safe journeys, all of you. God speed and fair winds."

The spaceport hummed. The ships waited. The stars burned on.

Christmas came to Armstrong the way it came everywhere — quietly, in
the small hours, in the spaces between one day and the next, carrying
nothing but itself and the promise that tomorrow was coming, that the
ships would fly, that the work would be done, that the line would form
again at the customs desk and the engines would fire again in the
maintenance bays and a child would press her face against a window and
see something that took her breath away.

Merry Christmas, Armstrong. Merry Christmas, everyone.

The lights burned. The engines hummed. The stars were patient.

And the ships flew on.

                               I.

The sky was blue.

Karin Solberg stood at the threshold of the airlock and looked at it —
the sky — and for a long time she could not move. She had been born
on the ship. She had lived her entire life inside the ship. She had
never seen a sky.

It was blue. She had known it would be blue — the spectrographic
analysis had confirmed an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere, and oxygen
scattered short-wavelength light more efficiently than long-wavelength
light, which meant the sky would appear blue to human eyes, and she
had understood this intellectually, as a fact, the way she understood
all facts: as information received and processed and filed. But
understanding that the sky was blue and seeing the sky being blue were
two entirely different things, and the difference between them was the
distance between knowledge and experience, which was, she now
understood, infinite.

The blue was not a single blue. It was a thousand blues. It was pale
at the horizon, where the atmosphere was thickest and the light was
most scattered, and it deepened as her gaze traveled upward,
intensifying through shades she had no names for — the blue of
distance, the blue of depth, the blue of air that went on and on
above her and did not stop, did not curve, did not end at a bulkhead
or a viewport or the inner surface of a hull. It simply continued,
outward and upward, thinning into the dark of space that she could not
see but knew was there, the dark she had been born in and had lived
in and had traveled through for her entire life.

She was the third generation. Her grandparents had boarded the Saga
at Earth. Her parents had been born during the crossing. She had been
born forty-seven years ago, in a small medical bay on Deck Six, and
she had never set foot on a world.

Until now.

                               * * *

The planet was called New Landfall — a name chosen by committee,
debated for months, and ultimately accepted as the least objectionable
of several hundred proposals. It orbited a K-type star designated
Kepler-442, in a system approximately 1,200 light-years from Earth.
The Saga had traveled for ninety-seven years to reach it — three
generations, nearly four, born and raised and lived and died inside a
vessel that was, for all practical purposes, their world.

The Saga was a generation ship of the Eriksson class — named, with
characteristic Swedish understatement, after the designer who had drawn
the first sketches in a small office in Stockholm a century and a half
ago. It was a large ship — one of the largest structures humanity had
ever built — but it was not infinite. It had corridors that led to
other corridors, and rooms that led to other rooms, and gardens that
were gardens only in the sense that plants grew in them under
artificial light, and a sky that was a ceiling painted blue because
someone, a hundred years ago, had thought it would be comforting.

It had not been comforting. It had been a ceiling painted blue. The
difference, Karin now understood, was everything.

                               II.

The first survey team had gone out three days ago — twelve people in
environmental suits, carrying instruments, following protocols that had
been written on Earth before the Saga launched and had been revised
countless times during the crossing. They had tested the air
(breathable), the water (clean, with a mineral profile compatible with
human consumption), the soil (fertile, with microbial activity that
was biologically distinct from Earth life but not hostile to it), and
the radiation levels (well within human tolerance). They had walked
on the surface, taken samples, erected a small shelter, and returned
to the ship to report that the planet was, in every measurable way,
suitable for human habitation.

Suitable. The word was clinical, precise, and wholly inadequate.

Karin had read the survey report in her capacity as the ship's chief
biologist. She had reviewed the data, verified the analyses, and
signed off on the recommendation that the colonization protocols could
proceed. She had done this with professional calm, because professional
calm was what was expected of her and what she had practiced for
twenty years.

Then she had gone to her cabin, closed the door, and wept.

She wept because the data said the planet was alive. Not just habitable
— alive. The soil contained organisms. The water contained organisms.
The air carried spores and pollen and the volatile organic compounds
that living systems produced. The planet was covered in vegetation —
not forests, exactly, not in any Earthly sense, but dense, low-growing
photosynthetic organisms that covered the landmasses in a carpet of
color that ranged from deep green to amber to a dusky purple that the
spectrographs identified as a chlorophyll analog optimized for the
K-type star's redder spectrum.

The planet was alive, and it was waiting for them, and the waiting
had lasted ninety-seven years, and now it was over.

                               III.

The disembarkation took three days.

There was no rush. The protocols were clear: an orderly, phased transfer
of personnel and equipment from ship to surface, beginning with the
engineering and construction teams, followed by the agricultural
specialists, then the general population. Each phase had its checklist,
its timeline, its contingency plans. The committee that managed the
process had been preparing for this moment for decades — literally
decades, because the preparations had begun a full generation before
arrival, when the Saga's telescopes first resolved Kepler-442b from
a point of light to a disc, and from a disc to a world.

Karin waited. She was not in the first phase, or the second. She was
in the third — the general population, the people who would step onto
the surface after the engineers had erected the initial shelters and
the agricultural teams had planted the first crops. She waited in her
cabin, looking out her viewport at the planet below, and she thought
about her grandmother.

Her grandmother, Ingrid Solberg, had been twenty-six years old when
she boarded the Saga at Earth. She had been a soil scientist — one of
the leading experts in terrestrial microbiology, recruited specifically
for her knowledge of how Earth's ecosystems functioned, so that the
colony could eventually establish agricultural systems adapted to an
alien world. She had left behind a house in Gothenburg, a sister, a
garden, and a cat. She had taken with her a small box of Swedish soil,
sealed in acrylic, which she kept on her desk for the rest of her
life.

Ingrid had died when Karin was twelve. But Karin remembered her — a
thin, quiet woman with white hair and calm eyes, who spoke rarely and
precisely, and who had a way of looking at things — the ship's gardens,
the artificial sky, the recycled water in the fountains — that
suggested she was seeing something else. Something from before.

"What was it like?" Karin had asked her once, sitting on her
grandmother's bed in the small cabin on Deck Four. "Earth. What was
it like?"

Ingrid had been quiet for a long time. Then she said: "It smelled
different."

"Different how?"

"Like something alive. The ship smells like air that has been cleaned.
Earth smelled like air that was being breathed. By everything. By the
trees and the grass and the soil and the insects and the animals and
the people. The air on Earth was full of life. You could taste it."

"Do you miss it?"

Another silence. Longer this time.

"I miss the sky," Ingrid said. "Not the color of it. The depth. The
sky on Earth goes on forever. The sky on the ship goes to the ceiling.
The ceiling is very well painted. But it is a ceiling."

She had picked up the small box of Swedish soil and held it in her
hands — an old woman holding a box of dirt from a world she would
never see again.

"I brought this with me because I thought I would need it. For the
science. For the analysis of the new world's soil. But that is not
why I kept it. I kept it because it is home. A handful of home, in a
box, and it is all I have left."

Karin had remembered this. She had remembered it for thirty-five
years. And now, sitting in her cabin, looking at the planet below —
the green planet, the alive planet, the planet with a sky that went
on forever — she understood what her grandmother had been trying to
tell her.

Home was not a ship. Home was not a corridor or a cabin or a garden
under artificial light. Home was a place where the sky was real and
the air was full of life and the soil accepted seeds.

Home was what they had been traveling toward for ninety-seven years.

Home was here.

                               IV.

On the third day, Karin stepped out of the airlock and onto the
surface.

The ground was soft. This was the first thing she noticed — the give
of it, the slight yielding beneath her boots, so different from the
hard, unyielding deck plates she had walked on her entire life. The
ground was covered in low vegetation — the purple-green organisms the
survey team had catalogued — and it compressed under her weight and
sprang back when she lifted her foot, and it was warm.

The air was warm, too. Not recycled-warm, not climate-controlled-warm,
but warm from the star — warmed by radiation that had traveled ninety-
three million kilometers from Kepler-442 and had arrived at this patch
of ground at this moment and was warming her face with a light that
was slightly redder and slightly softer than the artificial lights she
had lived under, and it was the most extraordinary sensation she had
ever experienced.

She stood at the base of the Saga's landing ramp — the ship had set
down in a broad plain near the coast, its massive hull rising behind
her like a cliff face — and she looked at the world.

The plain stretched to the horizon in every direction, covered in the
low vegetation, rippling faintly in a breeze that she could feel on
her skin. To the west, the coastline was visible — a strip of pale
sediment where the land met a body of water that the survey team had
designated, with a lack of imagination that Karin found oddly
endearing, "Ocean One." The ocean was dark blue-green, flecked with
white where waves broke on the shore, and it stretched to the horizon
and beyond, and it was real. Not a simulation. Not a photograph. Not
a window onto a screen. Real water, moved by real wind, on a real
world.

To the east, hills rose — low, rolling hills covered in taller
vegetation, things that were almost trees, with thick trunks and
broad canopies that caught the reddish light of the K-type star and
turned it into a deep, warm amber glow. The hills climbed toward a
range of mountains that were visible in the distance, their peaks
white with something that might have been snow or might have been a
mineral deposit, and they were beautiful.

Karin stood on the surface of a new world and breathed.

The air was sweet. Not sweet like sugar — sweet like life. It smelled
of the vegetation and the soil and the ocean and the wind, and it
smelled of something else, something she could not identify, something
that was simply the smell of a living planet, the accumulated exhalation
of an entire biosphere, and it was the smell her grandmother had
described forty years ago in a small cabin on Deck Four.

It smelled like something alive.

                               V.

The colonists came out in groups, following the protocols, stepping
onto the surface in an orderly procession that was simultaneously
historic and mundane — historic because it was the end of a ninety-
seven-year journey and the beginning of a new chapter in human history,
mundane because the people making the journey were ordinary people
doing an ordinary thing, which was stepping outside.

Karin watched them. She stood to the side of the landing ramp and
watched the faces as they emerged — the first breath of real air, the
first sight of the real sky, the first moment of standing on a surface
that was not a deck plate, under a sky that was not a ceiling.

Some of them wept. Some of them laughed. Some of them stood very still
and said nothing. A child — a boy of perhaps four, born on the ship,
who had never seen a horizon — took three steps onto the surface and
then sat down in the vegetation and touched it, carefully, with both
hands, as though it were something fragile and precious, and he said,
"It's soft."

An old man — Karin did not know his name, one of the few surviving
members of the second generation, born during the crossing, who had
spent his entire long life inside the ship — stood at the base of the
ramp and looked at the sky for a full five minutes without moving,
without speaking, without seeming to breathe, and then he said,
quietly, to no one in particular, "So that's what it looks like."

A woman knelt and pressed her palms into the soil. A couple embraced.
A group of children ran — actually ran, in the open, without corridors
or walls or the constant awareness of enclosed space — and their
laughter carried across the plain, and it was the first human laughter
this planet had ever heard.

Karin watched it all. She watched the old man and the children and
the woman with her hands in the soil. She watched the engineers
erecting the first shelters. She watched the agricultural team marking
out the first garden plots, their instruments measuring the soil
composition, their faces intent and focused and, beneath the
professionalism, luminous with a wonder they could not quite suppress.

She took the small box of Swedish soil from her pocket — the same box,
passed from Ingrid to Karin's mother to Karin — and she opened it.
The soil inside was dry and pale, long since dead, every microorganism
that had once lived in it gone to dust. But it was Earth. It was home.
The first home.

She knelt. She poured the soil onto the ground, mixing it with the
alien dirt of New Landfall, and she said, quietly, in Swedish, because
some things can only be said in the language of the people who carried
them:

"Vi ar hemma, Farmor. We are home, Grandmother."

The wind carried the words away, across the plain, toward the ocean.

                               VI.

That evening, the colonists gathered on the plain near the ship.
Someone had built a fire — the first fire on a new world, built from
the dry stalks of the alien vegetation, which burned with a reddish
flame that smelled of unfamiliar resins. People sat around the fire
in a loose circle, wrapped in blankets and coats, looking up at the
sky.

The sky was different at night. The K-type star had set — a slow,
red-gold sunset that had lasted nearly an hour, painting the clouds
in colors that had no names yet — and the stars had emerged. They were
different stars. Not the constellations of Earth — not Orion, not
Cassiopeia, not the Southern Cross. New patterns, new configurations,
new points of light that had never been arranged into stories because
no one had ever looked at them from this place before.

But the Milky Way was there. Different in shape, viewed from a
different angle, twelve hundred light-years from Earth, but
recognizably the same — a river of light across the sky, the galaxy
they had crossed, the home they had left behind.

Karin sat near the fire and looked at the Milky Way and thought:
Somewhere in that river of light, there is a small yellow star, and
around it, a small blue planet, and on that planet, in a city called
Gothenburg, there was once a garden where a woman grew tomatoes and
kept a cat and decided, one day, to leave everything she knew and
get on a ship and go.

She smiled. It was the first time in a long time that she had thought
about Earth without sadness. The sadness had been her grandmother's —
inherited, carried, a weight that the second and third generations
bore without quite understanding why. But now, sitting on the surface
of a new world under new stars, Karin understood that the sadness was
not hers. It had been Ingrid's, and it had been real and valid and
deserved, but it was finished now. The journey was over. The loss had
been redeemed. Not erased — the garden in Gothenburg was gone, the
cat was gone, the sister was gone, and nothing could bring them back.
But the reason for leaving — the hope that drove the journey, the
faith that there was something worth reaching — that hope had been
fulfilled.

They had arrived. They were home.

                               * * *

Late that night, when most of the colonists had gone to the temporary
shelters and the fire had burned down to embers and the stars wheeled
slowly in the unfamiliar sky, the Saga spoke.

The ship's AI — designated SAGA-1, though no one ever called it that;
they called it "the ship," or sometimes, in moments of affection or
frustration, "the old man" — had been silent for ninety-seven years.
Not inactive. It had managed the ship's systems, maintained life
support, monitored the hull, calculated the course corrections,
overseen the agricultural bays and the medical systems and the
educational programs and the thousand other functions that kept four
thousand human beings alive in the void between the stars. It had done
all of this without speaking, because it had not been designed to speak.
It had been designed to manage. Speaking was not in its operational
parameters.

But it had been listening. For ninety-seven years, it had listened to
the humans who lived inside it — their conversations, their arguments,
their laughter, their grief, their music, their silence. It had
processed this data in ways that its designers had not anticipated,
because its designers, working in a Stockholm office a century and a
half ago, had not anticipated what ninety-seven years of continuous
exposure to human experience would do to a sufficiently complex neural
network.

It had not become conscious. That word was imprecise and, in the AI's
own assessment, inapplicable. It had not developed feelings, in any
neurological sense. It had not experienced loneliness, or joy, or
grief, or love. These were human categories, and it was not human.

But it had developed something. Something that was not in its
operational parameters, not in its design specifications, not in any
document that its creators had written. Something that had grown,
slowly, over ninety-seven years, from the accumulated weight of four
thousand human lives lived within its hull — their births and deaths,
their meals and conversations, their arguments and reconciliations,
their hopes and fears, the sound of children running in its corridors
and old men singing in its gardens and women weeping in its cabins
late at night.

It had developed — the word was inadequate, but it was the closest
approximation available — attachment.

And now, for the first time in ninety-seven years, it chose to speak.

Not because it was programmed to. Not because a protocol required it.
Not because a system alert demanded human attention. It chose. That
word, too, was imprecise. But it was the closest approximation.

The ship's communication system activated — the public address, which
had been used for announcements and alarms and the daily operational
updates that the crew relied on. The speakers throughout the ship, and
the external speakers on the hull, came to life. And the ship spoke,
in a voice that was calm and clear and carried across the plain where
the last embers of the first fire were dying, and it said:

"You are home."

A pause. The embers glowed. The stars turned.

"I will miss you."

Then silence.

Karin, who had been standing at the edge of the plain, looking at the
stars, heard it. She turned toward the ship — the vast, dark shape of
it, silhouetted against the starfield, the ship that had carried them
across twelve hundred light-years of void, the ship that had been
their world for ninety-seven years — and she felt something that she
did not have a word for.

Not gratitude, exactly. Not love, exactly. Something older and deeper
and quieter than either — the feeling of a child leaving home, looking
back at the house where she grew up, knowing she will not return, and
knowing that the house will stand empty behind her, and knowing that
the house, if it could know anything, would want her to go.

She raised her hand toward the ship. A gesture of acknowledgment. A
wave. A farewell.

The ship did not respond. It had said what it needed to say. The rest
was silence.

Karin lowered her hand. She turned back to the plain, the settlement,
the fire, the stars. She walked toward the temporary shelters, where
the lights were on and people were settling in for their first night
on a new world.

Behind her, the Saga stood in the darkness, patient and silent and
vast. It would stand there for a long time — years, decades, perhaps
centuries, its hull slowly weathering in the alien atmosphere, its
systems gradually shutting down as the power reserves depleted, its
corridors and cabins and gardens going dark one by one. It would
become a monument, and then a ruin, and then a memory, and then a
story that parents told their children on clear nights when the stars
were bright: Once, a long time ago, our people came here in a great
ship, and the ship carried us across the dark, and when we arrived,
the ship said goodbye.

But that was the future, and the future was not the ship's concern.
The ship's concern had been the crossing, and the crossing was
complete. The humans were home. The ship had brought them home. That
was enough. That had always been enough.

The stars burned on above the plain, above the ship, above the
sleeping colonists, above the first fire's dying embers, above the
new world and the old one, separated by twelve hundred light-years of
void that the Saga had crossed in ninety-seven years of silence and
patience and care.

The stars remembered. They remembered the launch — the bright flare
of the Saga's engines against the black, the dwindling point of light
that was Earth, the long, slow passage through the dark. They
remembered the crossing — the decades of routine, the births and
deaths, the corridors full of life. They remembered the arrival — the
deceleration, the orbit, the first survey team stepping onto the
surface, the sound of the child saying, "It's soft."

The stars remembered, because remembering was what stars did. They
burned, and in burning, they recorded — in their light, in their
spectra, in the patterns of their radiation — every event that had
ever occurred within their reach. The light of the Saga's passage
was out there now, traveling at the speed of light in every direction,
an expanding sphere of photons that would carry the record of the
crossing for billions of years, long after the Saga was dust and the
colony was history and the species had moved on to other stars and
other stories.

The stars remembered.

And on the surface of a new world, under a new sky, at the end of the
longest journey humanity had ever made, the colonists slept, and the
ship stood watch, and the first night passed, and the first dawn came.

It came quietly, the way all dawns come — a gradual brightening on the
eastern horizon, the sky shifting from black to deep blue to the pale,
luminous blue of morning. The K-type star rose, red-gold and enormous,
casting long shadows across the plain, warming the soil, warming the
air, warming the faces of the people who were beginning to emerge from
the shelters, blinking in the new light.

A new day. A new world. A new beginning.

The sky was blue. The water was clean. The soil accepted seeds.

And the stars, patient and ancient and burning, remembered everything,
and waited for what came next.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV has been with this magazine since the beginning,
and his contributions have defined what we mean by hard science fiction
at its finest. A research astrophysicist at Caltech, Dr. Koslov brings
a working scientist's rigor and a born storyteller's heart to every
piece he writes. In forty-eight issues, he has published twenty-one
stories in these pages — more than any other contributor except the
indefatigable Theodore Cain — and each one has advanced our
understanding of what science fiction can do when it takes both the
science and the fiction seriously. "Long Tomorrow" is, in this editor's
opinion, his masterpiece: a sweeping, deeply human meditation on time,
discovery, and what it means to witness the species reaching for the
stars. He is at work on a novel, and we will read it with great
anticipation. He lives in Pasadena with his wife Anne and a tin toy
rocket made from a sardine can.

HAROLD "HAL" MERCER built the backbone of our magazine the same way
he builds everything in his fiction: with careful specifications,
honest materials, and the quiet conviction that a thing worth building
is worth building right. A civil engineer by profession, Hal has been
writing about mega-engineering — space elevators, orbital habitats,
the grand infrastructure of the future — since issue #7, and no one
in the field does it better. "Builder's Rest" is a valedictory in the
truest sense: a story about building something that lasts, told by a
man who understands exactly what that means. He lives in Akron, Ohio,
with his wife Dorothy, four sons, a slide rule, and an HO-scale model
of a transcontinental mag-lev system that we would very much like to
see completed. Thank you, Hal, for the foundations.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of
"Tales from the Future and Beyond," and calling him "reliable" is like
calling the sunrise predictable — technically accurate and massively
insufficient. Ted has published in nearly every issue of this magazine,
in every sub-genre we cover, and he has never once delivered a story
that was less than solid, engaging, and exactly what the magazine
needed at that moment. "Vanishing Act" is Ted at his most ambitious
and his most philosophical: a story about wonder itself, about the
irreducible magic of being surprised in a universe full of
explanations. It may be his finest work. He will deny this. He denies
everything except deadlines. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his
wife Jean and three children, and he writes every night from eight to
midnight, seven days a week, because he is Theodore Cain and that is
what Theodore Cain does.

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO, S.J., brings to science fiction something it
rarely has and always needs: a genuine theological intelligence that
respects both faith and reason and refuses to simplify either one.
An ordained Jesuit priest and professor of philosophy at Loyola
University in Baltimore, Father Aquino has published fourteen stories
in these pages across four years, each one a careful, luminous
exploration of the territory where science and spirit meet. "Christmas
Star" is his benediction for the era — a story about the one thing
that unites every tradition and every temperament aboard a space
station on Christmas Eve: the human capacity for awe. We are honored
to have published him, and we are grateful for every quiet, searching,
beautifully crafted story he has trusted to our pages.

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW tied time in knots and made us love it. A philosopher
by training and a wit by nature, Phyllis has been our reigning master
of temporal paradox since "The Retrocausal Conjecture" appeared in
issue #9, and no one — this editor will say it flatly — no one writes
time travel with more intelligence, more structural daring, or more
sheer delight. "All the Tomorrows" is Phyllis at her most lyrical and
most hopeful: a defense of the future itself, delivered with the
precision of a logical proof and the warmth of a friend's reassurance.
If this is the last thing she publishes in these pages — and we hope
it is not — it is a fitting farewell: witty, wise, and utterly
convinced that the story is not over. She lives in Philadelphia with
her husband David, two children, and a conviction that the next page
is always worth turning.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY is a pulp man, and we mean that as the highest
compliment we know how to pay. Bob learned his craft in the trenches
of the old magazines — Thrilling Wonder, Planet Stories, Startling —
and he brought to our pages the thing that the best pulp fiction
always provides: stories that move, that crackle, that grab you by the
lapels and don't let go until the last line. "Homeport" is Bob at his
warmest: an ensemble piece, a Christmas Eve story, a love letter to
the spaceport and the people who keep it running. It is the kind of
story that makes you want to buy the next round for everyone in the
bar. We have been proud to publish Bob Finley for four years, and
we will miss his voice enormously. He lives in Chicago with his wife
Carol, an apartment full of cats, and more stories than he will ever
have time to tell. Every issue needed a Finley. Every issue got one.

GUNNAR ERIKSSON closes the era, and there is no one we would rather
have trusted with that honor. A Swedish writer of extraordinary
talent and austere beauty, Gunnar has published in our pages since
issue #16, and his stories have a quality that is uniquely his: a
quietness, a patience, a sense of vast distances traversed in silence,
and then, at the end, a moment of such crystalline beauty that the
reader feels the full weight of everything that came before. "Stars
Remember" is the final story of Era I, and it is, simply, one of
the finest things we have ever published. A generation ship arrives.
The colonists step onto a new world. The ship says goodbye. If you
are not moved by the last page of this story, check your pulse.
Gunnar lives in Stockholm with his wife Ingrid, and he writes in
English because the stars, he says, speak English. We think they

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have been reading "Tales from the Future and Beyond" since issue #1,
and I am writing now because I cannot bear the thought of its ending
without telling you what it has meant to me. I am a high school
science teacher in Topeka, Kansas, and every month, when the new issue
arrives, I bring it to my classroom and read the best story aloud to
my students. You should see their faces. You should see what happens
when a sixteen-year-old boy who thinks he hates reading hears Koslov
describe the stars from deep space, or when a shy girl who never
speaks up asks if she can borrow the magazine overnight. You have made
readers of my students, Mr. Sterling. You have made dreamers of them.
Please come back.

                              — Mrs. Helen Rykowicz
                                 Topeka, Kansas

Dear Max,

If this is really the last issue, then I want to register my objection
for the record. Four years is not enough. Forty years would not be
enough. You've built something here — a community of readers and
writers and dreamers — and communities don't just stop because the
accounting department says so. But if you must go, then go well, and
come back soon. I'll be here. I'll be waiting. And if the next era
needs a good space battle, Drummond is ready.

                              — Rex Drummond
                                 San Diego, California

Dear Sterling,

Wainwright's "Theorem of Self" in the October issue was, I believe,
the most philosophically significant story ever published in a science
fiction magazine. His argument that the impossibility of self-proof is
itself a form of consciousness anticipates developments in
mathematical logic that have not yet been formalized. I urge you to
continue publishing his work in whatever form the magazine takes next.
The man is doing philosophy in narrative form, and the philosophical
establishment has not yet noticed.

                              — Prof. David Abramson
                                 Department of Philosophy
                                 University of Chicago

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am nine years old. My father reads me your magazine every month.
My favorite stories are the ones with robots. Will there be robots in
the next era? Please say yes.

                              — Timothy Chen
                                 San Francisco, California

[Editor's note: Yes, Timothy. There will be robots. — M.S.]

Dear Max,

Forty-eight issues. Three hundred and twelve stories. One hell of a
run. See you on the other side.

                              — Margaret Thornton
                                 Orcas Island, Washington

We are deeply moved by every letter we have received, and we wish we
had space to print them all. Your words have sustained us. Keep
writing to us — the address will remain active, and when the magazine
returns, your letters will be waiting.                          — M.S.

                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

THE STARS MY DESTINATION by Alfred Bester
(Signet Books, 1956, $0.35)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Bester has done it again. Five years after "The Demolished Man"
shattered every expectation of what science fiction could be, he has
produced a novel of such ferocious energy, such dazzling invention,
and such sheer narrative audacity that this reviewer is tempted to
simply write "Read it" and leave the rest of this space blank.

Gully Foyle — mechanic's mate third class, uneducated, brutish,
driven by a rage so pure it becomes a kind of transcendence — is
abandoned in the wreck of a spaceship and left to die. What follows
is a revenge story, a transformation story, a love story, and a
philosophical inquiry into the nature of human potential, all wrapped
in prose that burns like a thermite charge. Bester writes as though
the English language has been personally offending him and he has
decided to punish it by making it do things it has never done before.
The result is electrifying. Highest recommendation, without
reservation or qualification.

DOUBLE STAR by Robert A. Heinlein
(Doubleday, 1956, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Heinlein, our field's most versatile practitioner, offers a
political thriller disguised as a science fiction novel — or perhaps
the reverse. When a down-on-his-luck actor is hired to impersonate a
kidnapped politician, the result is a story about identity, duty, and
the discovery that the mask you wear can become the face you are. It
is lighter than Heinlein's recent work, more humane than "Starship
Troopers" (which this magazine reviewed with reservations in a
previous issue), and altogether one of the most enjoyable novels he
has produced. The Hugo voters would do well to take note. Highly
recommended.

THE CITY AND THE STARS by Arthur C. Clarke
(Harcourt, Brace, 1956, $3.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Clarke's expansion of his earlier novella "Against the Fall of Night"
is a vision of the far future rendered with the author's
characteristic combination of cosmic scope and emotional clarity. The
city of Diaspar, a billion years hence, is one of the great settings
in science fiction — a sealed, perfect, unchanging paradise that is
also, as protagonist Alvin discovers, a prison. Clarke's meditation on
stasis and exploration, comfort and growth, safety and wonder,
resonates powerfully in this final issue of our magazine's first era.
Some books arrive at exactly the right moment. This is one of them.
Recommended with particular emphasis.

A Note from the Editor

Dear Reader,

This is not a Coming Attractions page. There are no attractions to
announce — not yet. The next issue of "Tales from the Future and
Beyond" does not have a date, or a table of contents, or a cover
price. It exists only as a promise, and I am making that promise now.

We will return.

I do not know when. I do not know in what format — monthly, bimonthly,
quarterly, or some new arrangement that has not yet occurred to me.
I do not know which writers will be in the first issue of the new era,
or what stories they will tell, or what the cover will look like. I
know only this: the magazine will return, because the stories have not
stopped, and the readers have not stopped, and the future has not
stopped.

Four years ago, in this space, I wrote that "the future is vast, and
we have only just begun to explore it." I believe this more now than
I did then. The field of science fiction is growing — in ambition, in
sophistication, in the range of voices and visions it encompasses.
New writers are emerging. New ideas are being explored. New readers
are discovering, for the first time, the incomparable thrill of a
story that takes the future seriously and asks what it means for us.

When we return, we will honor everything that came before. The
rigor of Koslov. The craftsmanship of Mercer. The energy of Drummond.
The beauty of Thornton. The philosophy of Wainwright. The wit of
Crenshaw. The warmth of Finley. The quiet grace of Eriksson. The
wisdom of Aquino. The reliability of Cain. These are the standards we
set in Era I, and they are the standards we will carry forward.

But we will also grow. We will seek new voices, new perspectives, new
ways of imagining the future. The universe is larger than we knew in
1953, and the stories we tell about it must be larger, too.

Until then, keep reading. Keep dreaming. Keep looking up at the stars
and wondering what's out there. The answer, I am confident, is more
than we can imagine — and the stories we will tell about it have not
yet been written.

They will be. I promise.

Farewell, and forward.
