TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITORS' DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

We will not pretend that this is an ordinary issue of an ordinary
magazine arriving in ordinary times.

As we write this letter in the first week of October, American warships
patrol the Gulf of Tonkin, American advisors train South Vietnamese
soldiers in the use of American weapons, and the United States Congress
has, by near-unanimous vote, handed the President the authority to
escalate a war that most Americans cannot find on a map. The Resolution
passed the Senate 88 to 2. The two dissenting votes belonged to men who
remembered what happens when democracies write blank checks for war.

We are not a political magazine. We are a science fiction magazine. But
science fiction has always been the literature of consequence -- the
genre that asks "and then what?" with more persistence and more honesty
than any other form of storytelling. And the question that hangs over
this autumn of 1964 is precisely that: And then what?

We do not know. No one does. But we believe that the writers gathered in
this issue have earned the right to speculate, because they have been
speculating about consequences -- technological, political, moral,
ecological -- for years, and they have been more right more often than
most of the experts.

Colonel Stanton, who flew combat missions over two wars, has written
what we believe is the most searing military fiction we have ever
published: a story about proxy war, escalation, and the moment when
rational objectives disappear beneath the momentum of violence. It is
not a comfortable story. It is not meant to be.

Dr. Koslov offers something different: a quiet, luminous meditation on
quantum possibility and the lives we did not live. It is a story about
a garden, and it is a story about everything.

Dolores Reyes, whose debut in our pages earlier this year announced a
voice of extraordinary power, returns with a story about language,
colonialism, and the destruction of indigenous knowledge that resonates
far beyond its science-fictional setting.

Theodore Cain, our most dependable contributor, delivers a tale of
memory, wine, and the dangerous gift of perfect recall. Oscar Lennox
constructs a characteristically labyrinthine alternate history in which
the Library of Alexandria survives -- and what survives with it proves
both wondrous and terrible.

Gunnar Eriksson's generation ship story is austere and beautiful and
will, we suspect, make you hear music you have never heard before.

And Franklin Hoyt closes the issue with a story so prescient it
frightens us: a near-future America in which no one believes anything,
and the consequences arrive whether believed in or not.

Seven stories. Seven ways of asking: And then what?

We believe the responsibility of science fiction in times like these is
not to provide answers -- we distrust anyone who claims to have them --
but to insist on the question. To refuse the comfortable numbness of
not-thinking. To imagine consequences with such vividness that the
reader cannot look away.

The national mood is dark this November. We will not deny it. But
darkness is not the same as despair, and the act of imagining the future
-- even a difficult future, even a frightening one -- is itself an act
of faith. It says: there will be a tomorrow. It asks: what kind of
tomorrow do we want?

Read these stories. Argue with them. Write to us about them. The
conversation matters now more than ever.

Yours in uneasy times,

                         ESCALATION PROTOCOLS

                  by Col. James "Buck" Stanton (Ret.)

================================================================================

                               I.

The briefing room smelled like recycled air and flop sweat. Colonel
Martin Hale stood at the display board with a pointer he didn't need,
tapping coordinates that everyone in the room had memorized three
weeks ago.

"Gentlemen," Hale said. "The situation on Kessler IV has deteriorated."

Major Thomas Garrett sat in the second row and did not react. He had
learned long ago that the word "deteriorated" in a military briefing
meant that someone higher up had finally noticed what the men on the
ground had been reporting for months.

"The Directorate forces have pushed through the Valien corridor." Hale
tapped the map. "Three clan territories have fallen in the last eight
days. Our Tegari allies have been pushed back to the ridgeline here,
and here. They are requesting additional support."

Garrett looked at the map. The Tegari positions were marked in blue.
The Directorate-backed Moreshi positions were marked in red. The red
had grown considerably since the last briefing. The blue had not.

"Define 'additional support,'" said Lieutenant Colonel Vance, who sat in
the front row and asked the questions that needed asking.

"The Tegari council has formally requested acceleration of weapons
deliveries, deployment of additional military advisors, and--" Hale
paused. "Authorization for close air support from Advisory Group
assets."

The room was quiet. Garrett watched Vance's shoulders tighten by a
fraction of an inch.

"Our aircraft," Vance said.

"Flown by our pilots," Hale confirmed. "In support of Tegari ground
operations."

"Against Moreshi positions."

"Against Directorate-backed Moreshi positions, yes."

The distinction was important. It was also, Garrett knew, meaningless.
The Moreshi fighters in those positions didn't know or care whether their
weapons had been manufactured on Kerensky Station or shipped from the
Consolidated Republics' arsenal on Vega III. They knew that the weapons
worked. They knew that the humans who had given them the weapons had
also given them training, tactical doctrine, and the implicit promise
that the supply would continue as long as the fighting did.

And now the humans on the other side of the fight -- Garrett's side --
were being asked to do the same thing, only more of it.

Escalation. The word was clean and clinical, like the name of a medical
procedure. It did not describe what Garrett had seen in the Valien
corridor three days ago: the burned villages, the Tegari dead laid out
in rows that went on for a quarter mile, the survivors sitting in the
ash with the particular stillness of people who have passed beyond grief
into something that does not have a name in any human language.

"Questions?" Hale asked.

Garrett had questions. He had a great many questions. He kept them
behind his teeth.


                               II.

The Advisory Group compound sat on a plateau above the city of Tessara,
the Tegari regional capital. It was a collection of prefabricated
buildings surrounded by a perimeter fence that the Tegari guards
patrolled with weapons that had CONSOLIDATED REPUBLICS stenciled on
the stocks. The irony was not lost on Garrett, though he had stopped
finding it amusing some time ago.

He walked from the briefing building to his quarters through the late
afternoon heat. Kessler IV was a warm world -- surface temperatures
averaging thirty-one degrees Celsius in the temperate zones, higher
near the equator where most of the fighting was happening. The
atmosphere was breathable but thin. Garrett had been on-planet for
six months and still got winded climbing stairs.

His quarters were a ten-by-twelve room with a cot, a desk, a footlocker,
and a window that looked out over Tessara. The city spread down the
hillside in tiers of pale stone buildings with flat roofs and narrow
streets. Before the war it had been, by all accounts, a beautiful
place. It was still beautiful, if you didn't look too closely at the
sandbagged intersections and the supply trucks grinding through streets
built for foot traffic.

Garrett sat at his desk and opened the file that Hale had distributed
after the briefing. The classified annexes were worse than the
briefing itself. The Directorate wasn't just backing the Moreshi with
weapons. Intelligence indicated that Directorate military advisors --
their counterparts, the mirror image of Garrett's own Advisory Group --
were now embedded at the battalion level with Moreshi forces. They were
running operations. Planning attacks. Selecting targets.

Which meant that when Garrett's Tegari allies engaged Moreshi forces,
they were engaging units that had been organized, trained, and
directed by Directorate personnel.

Humans fighting humans through alien proxies.

He closed the file and stared at the wall.

The war on Kessler IV had begun, as these things usually did, as
somebody else's war. The Tegari and the Moreshi had been fighting over
the Valien corridor for two generations before humans ever set foot on
the planet. The corridor was rich in rare earth minerals and controlled
the only navigable pass between the northern and southern continental
masses. Both peoples claimed it by ancestral right. Both had grievances
that were legitimate, ancient, and irreconcilable.

The Consolidated Republics had allied with the Tegari because the
Tegari controlled the northern plateau, where the best landing sites
were, and because the Tegari clan council was willing to sign a
mineral rights agreement that gave the Republics favorable terms. The
Directorate had allied with the Moreshi because the Moreshi controlled
the southern ports and because the Directorate needed a foothold on
Kessler IV to counter Republic influence in the sector.

Neither side had allied with their respective clients because they
believed in the justice of the Tegari or Moreshi cause. Neither side
had intervened to resolve the underlying conflict. Both sides had
intervened to win it -- or rather, to prevent the other side from
winning it, which was not the same thing but which produced the same
result: more weapons, more advisors, more escalation.

Garrett had been a soldier for twenty-two years. He had fought in the
Proxima campaign and the Regulan border dispute. He understood the
logic of strategic competition. He understood that the Directorate's
expansion into the Kessler sector threatened Republic interests. He
understood that a Directorate-aligned Kessler IV would shift the
balance of power in ways that the Republic's strategic planners found
unacceptable.

He understood all of this. He had briefed it. He had written reports
supporting it. He had trained Tegari officers in the tactical doctrine
that implemented it.

And he had walked through the Valien corridor three days ago and seen
what it looked like when strategic logic met flesh and bone.


                               III.

The Tegari liaison officer was a clan-captain named Sorath. He was
young for his rank -- the equivalent of a human in his late twenties --
with the lean, angular build common to the highland Tegari and a face
that would have been handsome by human standards if not for the
exhaustion that had settled into it like sediment. His English was
excellent. His eyes were not.

"Major Garrett," Sorath said, standing in the doorway of Garrett's
quarters. "I am told there was a briefing."

"Come in, Captain."

Sorath entered and stood at something approximating attention. The
Tegari had their own military traditions, older than anything on Earth,
but six months of working with the Advisory Group had layered human
military manners on top of them. The result was a hybrid posture that
was neither fully Tegari nor fully human. Garrett had seen this before,
on other worlds, with other allies. The small erosions came first.

"The briefing concerned the Valien situation," Garrett said. "Your
council's request has been forwarded to Republic Command."

"And the answer?"

"Pending."

Sorath's expression did not change, but something shifted behind his
eyes. "Pending," he repeated. "While the Moreshi advance."

"I understand your frustration, Captain."

"With respect, Major, I do not think you do."

The words were quiet and precise and Garrett did not argue with them.
Sorath was right. Garrett's frustration was professional. Sorath's was
existential. It was Sorath's people in those rows in the corridor.
Sorath's villages burning. Sorath's world being ground down between two
powers that had turned a local conflict into a theater of their own
competition.

"I have been authorized to increase weapons shipments by forty
percent," Garrett said. "The accelerated schedule begins next week."

"Weapons," Sorath said. The word carried weight in the particular way
that words carry weight when they are insufficient.

"More advisors are being assigned. I'll have an additional twelve
personnel within the month."

"And the air support?"

"Pending."

Sorath nodded. He stood in silence for a moment, and then he said
something that Garrett would remember for the rest of his life.

"When we began this war, Major, we knew what we were fighting for.
The Valien corridor. Our lands. Our people. The Moreshi knew what they
were fighting for as well. We disagreed, but we understood each other.
Now your people and the Directorate's people have come, and you have
given us better weapons and better tactics and better reasons to keep
fighting, and somewhere in all of this giving, we have lost the thing
we were fighting for. I cannot find it anymore. I do not think the
Moreshi can find it either. But the fighting continues because the
weapons continue, and the weapons continue because the fighting
continues, and I do not know how to stop the wheel."

He paused. "That is my frustration, Major. It is not that you will not
help us. It is that you have helped us too much, and in helping, you
have taken the war from us and made it yours. And your wars do not end."

Garrett said nothing. There was nothing to say.

Sorath left. Garrett sat at his desk in the failing light and listened
to the sound of supply trucks moving through Tessara below.


                               IV.

The next three weeks were a demonstration in the mechanics of
escalation.

Republic Command approved the forty-percent weapons increase on day
two. The shipments began arriving at the Tessara airfield on day five.
Crates of pulse rifles, squad automatic weapons, anti-armor charges,
communications equipment, medical supplies. Garrett supervised the
distribution. The Tegari received the weapons with the efficiency of
long practice and moved them to the forward positions.

On day eight, Directorate intelligence assets detected the increased
shipments. On day ten, the Directorate announced a corresponding
increase in military assistance to the Moreshi. On day twelve, satellite
reconnaissance confirmed that new weapons systems -- heavier than
anything previously deployed -- were arriving at Moreshi positions in the
southern corridor.

On day fifteen, the twelve additional advisors arrived at Tessara.
Garrett assigned them to Tegari units along the ridgeline. They were
young, most of them. Bright-eyed. Eager. They had studied the briefing
materials on the transport and arrived with tactical recommendations
that Garrett filed without comment.

On day eighteen, intelligence reported that the Directorate had deployed
an additional twenty advisors to Moreshi units. The Directorate
advisors, unlike the Republic advisors, were authorized to participate
directly in combat operations.

On day twenty, a Tegari patrol was ambushed in the lower corridor. The
patrol included two of Garrett's new advisors. One was killed. The
other, a lieutenant named Chen, was evacuated with burns over forty
percent of his body. The weapons used in the ambush were of Directorate
manufacture.

On day twenty-one, Garrett sent a flash message to Republic Command
reporting the first Advisory Group combat fatality on Kessler IV.

On day twenty-two, Republic Command authorized close air support for
Tegari ground operations. The authorization was accompanied by Rules of
Engagement that ran to forty-seven pages. Garrett read every page. The
rules were specific, detailed, and carefully constructed to maintain the
fiction that the Consolidated Republics were not at war on Kessler IV.

Garrett folded the document and placed it in his desk drawer. Then he
walked to the window and looked out over Tessara, where the lights were
coming on in the dusk, and the supply trucks were still moving, and
somewhere in the southern corridor the Tegari and the Moreshi were
killing each other with weapons that had been manufactured on worlds
neither people had ever seen.


                               V.

The first air strike was conducted on a Tuesday. Garrett did not fly
the mission. He was not a pilot. He was a ground advisor whose job was
to coordinate between the Tegari force commanders and the Republic air
assets that were now, officially, supporting them.

He stood in the operations center -- a prefabricated building with
reinforced walls and a communications suite that was better equipped
than most things on the planet -- and listened to the pilots' voices
on the comm channel. Two strike aircraft, Republic-piloted, flying
Republic-manufactured close support ships armed with Republic
ordnance, hitting targets that had been identified by Tegari
intelligence and approved by Republic command through a chain of
authorization that ran from Tessara to sector headquarters to Republic
Strategic Command and back again.

The targets were Moreshi artillery positions in the lower corridor.
The Moreshi had been shelling Tegari settlements along the ridgeline
for two weeks. Civilian casualties were mounting. The Tegari council
had demanded action. Republic Command had authorized action. Everyone
in the chain had documented their authorization in writing.

"Raptor Lead, target acquired. Commencing run."

The pilot's voice was calm and professional. Garrett listened. He heard
the tone of weapons release. He heard the pilot confirm impact. He heard
the second pilot confirm the same.

"Raptor Lead, strike complete. Two targets neutralized. Returning to
base."

The operations center staff recorded the data. Garrett noted the time.
The entire engagement had lasted less than four minutes.

He walked outside afterward and stood in the compound yard. The sky was
the dull orange of a Kessler IV sunset, and the air smelled like dust
and engine exhaust. He could see, in the distance, the faint smudge of
smoke rising from the direction of the lower corridor.

Sorath found him there.

"It is done?" the Tegari officer asked.

"It's done."

Sorath looked at the smoke. "How many?"

"We struck artillery positions. The damage assessment will--"

"How many of them died, Major?"

Garrett paused. "The initial assessment indicates approximately thirty
Moreshi fighters at the two positions."

"Thirty," Sorath said. "And how many were Moreshi, and how many were
Directorate?"

"The positions were identified as Moreshi."

"But the Directorate advisors are embedded with Moreshi units. At the
battalion level. Your own intelligence says this."

Garrett said nothing.

"So it is possible," Sorath said quietly, "that Republic aircraft,
flown by Republic pilots, have just killed Directorate personnel."

"That has not been confirmed."

"But it is possible."

"Yes. It is possible."

Sorath was quiet for a long time. The smoke continued to rise in the
distance.

"When I was young," he said, "my father told me that the Moreshi were
our enemies because they took what was ours. A simple thing. Easy to
understand. Now I stand here and watch smoke rise from a place where
people I have never met have been killed by other people I have never
met, using weapons built on worlds I will never see, in furtherance of
a strategy I do not understand, and I am told that this is being done
for me. For my people. In our name." He paused. "This is what help
looks like, Major?"

Garrett had no answer. He watched the smoke.


                               VI.

The escalation continued.

The Directorate confirmed, two days after the air strike, that three
of its military advisors had been killed in the attack on the Moreshi
positions. The confirmation was delivered through diplomatic channels
with language that was correct, precise, and unmistakably threatening.

Republic diplomatic staff responded with language that was equally
correct, equally precise, and which expressed regret for the loss of
Directorate personnel while noting that the strike had been conducted
against legitimate military targets in accordance with the Rules of
Engagement.

Behind the diplomatic language, things moved. The Directorate deployed
anti-aircraft systems to Moreshi positions. The Republic deployed
electronic countermeasures to Tegari positions. The Directorate
increased its advisory personnel to sixty. The Republic matched. The
Directorate shipped heavy armor. The Republic shipped anti-armor
systems.

Each escalation was rational. Each was proportionate. Each was
documented, authorized, and justified by the escalation that preceded
it. The logic was impeccable. The logic was insane.

Garrett watched it happen with the sick clarity of a man watching a
vehicle accident in slow motion. He wrote reports. He filed them
through channels. He used the approved language: "force protection
requirements," "advisory mission parameters," "graduated response
options." The language was designed to describe what was happening
without ever quite saying what was happening.

What was happening was that two human powers were fighting a war on an
alien world, using alien soldiers as their primary combat forces, and
the alien soldiers were dying in numbers that made the original Tegari-
Moreshi conflict look like a border skirmish.

Garrett's advisory team had grown to forty-three personnel. They were
embedded with Tegari units from the ridgeline to the coast. They
trained. They advised. They coordinated air strikes. They called them
"advisory operations." The Tegari called them something else. The
word, in the Tegari language, translated roughly as "the outsiders'
war."

He began hearing things from his advisors in the field. Things that
were not in the briefing materials. Things that made him sit alone in
his quarters at night and stare at the ceiling.

Lieutenant Torres, embedded with a Tegari battalion near the eastern
corridor, reported that her unit had engaged a Moreshi force that
included child soldiers. The children were twelve, maybe thirteen --
young Moreshi armed with Directorate weapons that were designed for
adult hands and too heavy for them to fire accurately, which meant
they sprayed rounds in wild arcs that were, if anything, more dangerous
than aimed fire.

Captain Mbeki, in the southern sector, reported that the Tegari
commander he was advising had ordered the destruction of a Moreshi
village that had been providing support to Moreshi fighters. The
village was civilian. Mbeki had protested. The Tegari commander had
pointed to the weapons the Advisory Group had provided and said, "You
gave us these. You trained us to use them. You do not get to choose
what we use them for."

Warrant Officer Singh, on the ridgeline, reported that Tegari fighters
were painting Republic insignia on their vehicles and equipment --
not because they had been told to, but because they had learned that
Moreshi forces were less likely to attack targets that appeared to be
directly Republic-operated. The tactic worked. It also meant that
every Moreshi fighter on the planet now understood that Republic forces
and Tegari forces were, for all practical purposes, the same thing.

Garrett compiled these reports. He sent them through channels. He used
the proper forms.

Nothing changed.


                               VII.

The breaking point came on a Thursday.

Garrett was in the operations center when the call came in from the
field. A Tegari battalion, supported by three Republic advisors, had
launched an assault on a Moreshi-held town in the central corridor. The
assault had been authorized at the Advisory Group level. It was a
legitimate military operation targeting a logistics hub.

The assault went wrong in the first ten minutes. The Moreshi defenders
were better equipped and better positioned than intelligence had
indicated. Directorate advisors, embedded with the defense force, had
prepared a kill zone. The Tegari assault force walked into it.

Garrett listened to the radio traffic. It was fragmented, chaotic,
overlapping. Voices in Tegari and English, shouting over the sound of
weapons fire. One of his advisors -- Sergeant First Class Reeves --
was on the channel, his voice tight with the controlled calm of a
professional soldier in a very bad situation.

"Overwatch, this is Advisor Seven. We are pinned in the market district.
Taking heavy fire from three sides. I have twelve Tegari casualties,
two critical. Requesting immediate air support at the following
coordinates."

Garrett checked the coordinates against the Rules of Engagement.
The target area was within a populated zone. The Rules required
positive identification of military targets before weapons release in
populated areas. Positive identification required visual confirmation
by a forward observer.

"Advisor Seven, confirm visual identification of military targets at
specified coordinates."

A pause. Weapons fire in the background.

"Overwatch, I can confirm I'm getting shot at from those coordinates.
That's as positive as it gets."

"Advisor Seven, Rules of Engagement require--"

"I know what the Rules require, Overwatch. I have men dying. I have
Tegari soldiers who trusted us dying. I need air support or I need
extraction, and I need one of them in the next five minutes."

Garrett looked at the map. He looked at the Rules. He looked at the
forty-seven pages of carefully constructed legal fiction that was
designed to allow the Consolidated Republics to fight a war while
maintaining that they were not fighting a war.

He authorized the air strike.

The strike aircraft arrived in seven minutes. They struck the positions
from which Reeves's unit was taking fire. The fire stopped. Reeves and
the surviving Tegari fighters withdrew.

The damage assessment arrived four hours later. The strike had
destroyed the Moreshi fighting positions. It had also destroyed a
residential block adjacent to the fighting positions. Initial
estimates indicated between forty and sixty civilian casualties. The
majority were Moreshi noncombatants. There were children among the
dead.

Garrett read the assessment at his desk. He read it twice. Then he
put it down and sat in the silence of his quarters while the supply
trucks moved through Tessara below and the sun went down over a world
that had been at war before humans arrived and would, he understood
now with absolute clarity, be at war long after they left.

He had authorized the strike. He would do it again. Reeves and the
Tegari soldiers would have died otherwise. That was the calculus.
That was the logic.

And the logic was what had brought them here. The logic was what had
killed those children in the residential block. Not malice, not
cruelty, not the fog of war, but logic. The impeccable, documented,
authorized logic of escalation that began with a mineral rights
agreement and a strategic assessment and a reasonable concern about
the balance of power, and that led, step by reasonable step, to a
major in a prefabricated building authorizing an air strike that killed
children in a town whose name he could barely pronounce on a world that
was not his.


                               VIII.

He found Sorath on the compound wall, looking out over the city.
The Tegari officer stood very still, the way his people stood when they
were thinking or grieving, which Garrett had come to understand were
often the same thing.

"You have heard," Garrett said.

"Yes."

"I authorized the strike."

"I know."

They stood together in the darkness. Below them, Tessara's lights
flickered in the thin atmosphere. Somewhere to the south, the corridor
burned.

"Captain Sorath, I want to ask you something, and I want an honest
answer."

"I have always been honest with you, Major."

"Is this war still about the Valien corridor?"

Sorath was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was very
tired.

"I do not know what this war is about anymore, Major. I know what it
was about. I know what your briefing documents say it is about. I know
what the Moreshi say it is about. I know what the Directorate says it
is about. I know what the Republic says it is about. Everyone has
reasons. Everyone has documents. Everyone has logic."

He paused.

"My cousin died in the assault today. He was twenty-three. He was
fighting for a town that neither the Republic nor the Directorate
had heard of six months ago, with a weapon that was manufactured on
a world he could not name, following a tactical plan that was designed
by men he had never met, in a war that has grown so large that the
thing it was originally about -- our home, our land, the place where
my cousin was born -- has become irrelevant. The corridor is
irrelevant. The minerals are irrelevant. What matters now is that the
Republic cannot be seen to lose and the Directorate cannot be seen to
lose, and so the war will continue until one of your sides decides that
the cost of this world exceeds its strategic value, and then you will
leave, and we will be here in the ruins, and we will try to remember
what we were fighting for before you came to help us."

Garrett listened. He did not argue. He did not explain. He did not
reach for the approved language or the strategic rationale or any of
the words that he had been trained to use.

"I'm sorry," he said.

"I know you are," Sorath said. "That is the worst part. You are sorry.
The Directorate advisors are sorry. Everyone is sorry. The sorrow is as
abundant as the weapons. But the weapons keep coming and the sorrow
keeps coming and neither one stops the other."


                               IX.

Garrett wrote the report at 0300 hours. He sat at his desk with the
lamp on and the window dark and he wrote a document that no one in his
chain of command wanted to receive.

He titled it: ASSESSMENT OF ADVISORY GROUP OPERATIONS, KESSLER IV:
AN HONEST ACCOUNTING.

It was not long. Garrett was not a writer. He was a soldier who had
spent twenty-two years learning to use approved language, and now he
stripped that language away and wrote in plain words what he had seen
and what he understood.

He wrote that the advisory mission on Kessler IV had achieved its
stated tactical objectives. Tegari forces were better trained, better
equipped, and better supported than at any point in the conflict.
Republic strategic interests in the Kessler sector were being
maintained. The Directorate's expansion had been checked.

He wrote that the advisory mission on Kessler IV had also, in the
course of achieving those objectives, transformed a local territorial
dispute into a proxy war between two human powers, using an indigenous
population as the primary combatant force. That the war had escalated
beyond any rational proportion to its original causes. That the
escalation was driven not by events on the ground but by the
competitive logic of the two human powers, each of which responded
to the other's escalation with a corresponding escalation, in a
cycle that had no natural termination point. That the indigenous
populations on both sides -- Tegari and Moreshi -- had been reduced
to instruments of a conflict that was no longer theirs.

He wrote that civilian casualties were mounting. That the Rules of
Engagement, however carefully constructed, could not prevent collateral
damage in a conflict zone where military and civilian populations were
intermingled. That the distinction between advisory operations and
combat operations had collapsed in practice, whatever the documents
said. That the Consolidated Republics was, in every meaningful sense,
at war on Kessler IV, and that the refusal to acknowledge this fact
was not a policy but an evasion.

He wrote that the war could not be won. Not by the Republic. Not by
the Directorate. Not by the Tegari or the Moreshi. The war could only
be continued, at increasing cost to all parties, for as long as the
two human powers found it strategically convenient to continue it.

He recommended immediate cessation of escalation. A freeze on weapons
shipments. Withdrawal of advisory personnel to the compound.
Diplomatic engagement with the Directorate toward a mutual withdrawal.
A peace conference, mediated by a neutral party, to address the
underlying Tegari-Moreshi territorial dispute.

He knew what would happen to the report. It would be received. It
would be noted. It would be filed. It would change nothing.

He sent it anyway.


                               X.

The response came in seventy-two hours. It was not from Republic
Command. It was from a deputy assistant secretary in the political
section, and it was two paragraphs long.

The first paragraph thanked Major Garrett for his dedication and his
candor. The second paragraph informed him that his assessment had been
reviewed and that his recommendations were not consistent with current
Republic policy in the Kessler sector. It further informed him that
he was being reassigned to a staff position at sector headquarters,
effective immediately.

The language was polite. The meaning was clear.

Garrett read it, folded it, and placed it in his pocket.

He spent his last day on Kessler IV walking through Tessara. Not in
the compound. Not in the operations center. In the city itself, among
the Tegari civilians who lived in the shadow of a war that had grown
beyond anyone's ability to control it.

He walked through the market, where vendors sold whatever they could
find. He walked past a school where children sat in rows, learning
lessons in a language that Garrett would never speak, on a world that
Garrett had helped to break. He walked to the edge of the plateau and
looked out over the corridor, where smoke still rose in thin columns
from the latest round of fighting.

He found Sorath at the compound gate, waiting for him. The Tegari
officer had heard.

"You are leaving," Sorath said.

"I've been reassigned."

"Because of the report."

"Yes."

Sorath was quiet. Then he held out his hand -- a human gesture he had
learned from the advisors. Garrett took it.

"You tried," Sorath said. "It was not enough. It was never going to be
enough. But you tried, and that is not nothing."

"Your war," Garrett said. "Take it back, if you can."

Sorath smiled. It was the saddest expression Garrett had ever seen on
a face that was not quite human.

"It stopped being our war a long time ago, Major. You know that."

Garrett released his hand and walked to the transport. The engines
were already running. The cargo bay was full of new supplies: weapons,
ammunition, communications equipment, medical kits. Everything an
ally could need.

As the transport lifted off, Garrett looked down at Tessara. The city
grew smaller. The compound. The market. The school. The plateau.
The corridor beyond, with its smoke and its silence.

The pilot banked south, following the route that would take them to the
orbital transfer station. Below, the fighting continued. It would
continue tomorrow, and the day after, and the day after that. The
weapons would continue. The advisors would continue. The escalation
would continue. Step by reasonable step, authorization by
authorization, document by document, until the cost exceeded the
value, and the powers withdrew, and the ruins were left to those who
had lived in them.

Garrett watched Kessler IV shrink beneath him. A world. A war.
A reasonable decision that had led to another reasonable decision that
had led to another, and another, until the accumulation of reasonable
decisions became something monstrous that no one had intended and no
one could stop.

The transport entered the upper atmosphere. The planet fell away. The
stars came out, cold and indifferent.

Garrett closed his eyes.

He did not look back.

                       THE PROBABILITY GARDEN

                        by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                               I.

The garden occupied three-quarters of an acre on the eastern slope of
Mount Lowe, above Pasadena, on land that the California Institute of
Technology had leased to Professor Emeritus Oren Pavelka for a dollar a
year and the understanding that he would not blow anything up. This last
condition was Pavelka's own joke -- he had insisted it be written into
the lease -- and it referred to an incident in 1947 that the university
preferred not to discuss and that Pavelka himself described, when pressed,
as "an unexpected verification of a theoretical limit."

He was seventy-one years old. He had spent forty-three of those years
in the physics department at Caltech, publishing papers on quantum field
theory that were cited by people who understood them and admired by
people who did not. He had contributed, in ways that remained classified,
to the work at Los Alamos during the war, and he had spent the
subsequent two decades trying to reconcile the thing he had helped build
with the universe he had spent his life trying to understand. The
reconciliation had not been achieved. He doubted it would be.

But the garden was helping.

He knelt in the early morning light, his knees on a foam pad that his
doctor had recommended and his pride had initially resisted, and
examined the plant that had come up overnight in plot seven. It was
approximately fifteen centimeters tall, with a stem the color of raw
copper and three leaves that were not quite leaves -- they had the
shape of leaves but the texture of something between silk and mica,
and they caught the light in a way that made them appear to flicker
at the edges, as though they were not entirely committed to being
there.

"Good morning," Pavelka said to the plant. He had taken to talking to
the plants. It was, he acknowledged, unscientific. He did it anyway.

He consulted his notebook. Plot seven had been seeded three months ago
with material from the Kepler-442b sample set: seeds -- or rather,
the functional equivalents of seeds, which were technically spore-
analogs encased in a crystalline protein matrix -- collected by the
second survey expedition and shipped back in nitrogen-sealed containers
that the Caltech biology department had examined, catalogued, and
then, with some reluctance, entrusted to a retired physicist who
wanted to put them in dirt.

The biology department's reluctance was understandable. The samples
were irreplaceable. There were finite quantities of xenobiological
material from each of the eleven worlds that had been surveyed since
the Threshold Drive made interstellar travel possible in 1951, and the
standard protocol was to preserve them under controlled laboratory
conditions for study, not to scatter them in a hillside garden and
see what happened.

But Pavelka had argued -- in the patient, precise, faintly amused
manner that had won him countless faculty debates -- that the entire
point of seeds was to grow, and that studying them in sealed containers
was like studying music by examining a silent piano. The biology
department had eventually yielded, partly because Pavelka's argument
was sound and partly because he was Oren Pavelka and saying no to him
required more stamina than most people possessed.

The garden now contained seeds from nine of the eleven surveyed worlds.
Two sets -- from Gliese 667Cc and the Tau Ceti system -- had not
germinated. The remaining nine had produced plants that were, by any
reasonable standard, impossible.

Not impossible in the sense that they violated known physics. Pavelka
was careful about this distinction. The plants did not violate known
physics. They suggested unknown physics, which was a very different
thing and which was, from Pavelka's perspective, considerably more
interesting.


                               II.

The impossible thing about the garden was this: the plants existed in
superposition.

Pavelka had first noticed it with the Kepler-62f specimens, which he
had planted in plot three during the second month. The seeds germinated
normally -- or what passed for normally with xenobiological material --
and produced shoots that grew at a steady rate and developed in
patterns that were consistent with their planetary origin. But when
Pavelka examined the plants closely, recording his observations in the
meticulous notebooks he had kept since graduate school, he found that
the plants were not quite the same from one observation to the next.

Not growing differently. Not changing in the normal sense. Being
different. A plant that he had recorded on Tuesday as having four leaves
with serrated edges would, on Wednesday, have five leaves with smooth
edges. The stem color would shift. The branching pattern would
rearrange. Once, a flowering structure that had been present at 8:00 AM
was absent at 8:15 AM, replaced by a seed pod that appeared to be
several weeks mature.

Pavelka's first hypothesis was contamination. His second was error.
His third was instrumentation failure. He tested and discarded each one
with the thoroughness that had characterized his professional life,
and when he had eliminated the mundane explanations, he was left with
an explanation that was not mundane at all.

The plants were not growing in a single state. They were growing in
multiple states simultaneously, collapsing into a specific configuration
only when observed, and collapsing into a different configuration with
each observation. They were, in the precise technical sense of quantum
mechanics, in superposition -- not at the subatomic level, where
superposition was well-documented, but at the macroscopic level, where
it was supposed to be impossible.

Pavelka sat in his garden on the morning he confirmed this finding and
felt something he had not felt in twenty years: the vertigo of genuine
surprise.

He was a quantum physicist. He had spent his career studying the
behavior of particles that existed in multiple states until measured.
He had written the standard textbook on quantum decoherence -- the
process by which quantum superposition collapses into classical
reality at macroscopic scales. He had proven, mathematically, that
decoherence made macroscopic superposition effectively impossible under
normal conditions.

And now, in his garden, in the California sunlight, plants from other
worlds were being impossible.

He could have published immediately. The finding would have been the
most significant discovery of the decade, possibly the century. It
would have brought teams of researchers, instrumentation, funding,
and the full apparatus of institutional science descending on his
hillside garden like a swarm of well-credentialed locusts.

He did not publish.

Instead, he made a pot of coffee, carried it to the wooden bench at the
garden's center, and sat there for an hour, looking at his plants and
thinking.


                               III.

His daughter, Marta, visited on Saturdays. She was forty-three, a
structural engineer who designed bridges, and she had her mother's dark
eyes and her father's habit of pausing before she spoke, as though
weighing each word on an invisible scale.

"You look tired, Papa."

"I am seventy-one. I am entitled to look tired."

She poured herself coffee from the thermos he kept by the bench and
sat beside him. The garden spread before them in its rows and plots,
each one marked with a small metal tag indicating the world of origin.
The plants were extraordinary -- colors that did not exist in terrestrial
botany, textures that seemed to belong to different sensory categories
entirely, growth patterns that spiraled and branched in geometries that
Euclid would not have recognized.

"How are they doing?" Marta asked.

"They are doing something remarkable."

"More remarkable than the usual remarkable?"

He smiled. This was their rhythm, the easy teasing that had replaced
the more fraught conversations of her adolescence, when his absences --
at the lab, at the blackboard, in the country of his own mind -- had
been a source of pain that he had noticed too late.

"The plants are in superposition," he said.

Marta set down her coffee. She was not a physicist, but she was an
engineer, and she was Oren Pavelka's daughter, and she knew what the
word meant.

"That's not possible."

"I am aware of this."

"Your own work proves that's not possible."

"My own work proves that it is not possible under normal conditions.
The conditions, it appears, are not normal."

She stared at the garden. The Kepler-442b plant in plot seven flickered
faintly at the edges of its leaves, as though it were a signal
struggling to resolve.

"When you observe them--"

"They collapse. Each observation produces a specific state. But the
state is different each time. Not randomly different. The states
correspond to the different possible growth outcomes of the plant.
Different branching patterns. Different leaf structures. Different
flowering schedules. Each observation selects one possibility from the
set of all possibilities."

"The many-worlds interpretation," Marta said.

"In botanical form." He paused. "These plants grew on worlds where
the environmental conditions -- the quantum decoherence rates, the
interaction between biological systems and their physical substrates --
are different from Earth. On their home worlds, the superposition is
presumably stable. Here, in our environment, the superposition is
marginally unstable. Observation triggers collapse. But the collapse is
temporary. Given time, the plant returns to superposition and awaits
the next observation."

"A garden of Schrodinger's cats."

"Schrodinger's flowers," he corrected. "Which is a considerable
improvement, aesthetically."

They sat in silence for a while. The morning light moved across the
garden, and the plants shifted in it -- not in the way that terrestrial
plants shifted in wind or light, but in the deeper way that Pavelka
had come to recognize: the shimmer of multiplicity, the visual
signature of a system existing in more states than one.

"Why haven't you published?" Marta asked.

It was the question he had been asking himself for three weeks.

"Because I am not sure that publication is the right thing to do."

"Papa. This is the most important discovery since the Threshold Drive."

"Yes. And the Threshold Drive gave us the ability to reach other worlds.
And we reached them. And we surveyed them. And we brought back samples.
And I put the samples in the ground. And now I have a garden that
demonstrates macroscopic quantum superposition, which means that I have
a garden that proves the many-worlds interpretation is not merely a
mathematical formalism but a physical reality. Every possible state is
real. Every possible outcome exists. And when I look at these plants--"

He stopped. He removed his glasses and cleaned them, which was what he
did when he needed a moment.

"When I look at these plants, I see all the lives they could have
lived. All the shapes they could have taken. All the flowers they could
have produced. Each one real. Each one waiting to be observed into
existence. And I wonder, Marta--"

He replaced his glasses.

"I wonder about all the lives I could have lived. All the choices I
made and did not make. Your mother. The work at Los Alamos. The years I
spent at the blackboard instead of watching you grow up. In some other
branch of the wave function, I made different choices. I am a different
man. You are a different woman. The world is a different world."

He looked at his garden.

"If I publish this, it will become a technology. That is what we do
with discoveries. We turn them into technologies. Someone will find a
way to select among the superposed states. To choose which possibility
becomes real. To collapse the wave function deliberately, not randomly.
And then we will have the power to choose our realities, and I have
lived long enough to know what we do with that kind of power."

Marta was quiet for a long time.

"You can't suppress a discovery, Papa."

"I am not suppressing it. I am tending a garden."


                               IV.

The months passed. Pavelka tended his garden.

He kept his notebooks. He recorded his observations with the precision
that had defined his professional life, filling page after page with
measurements, sketches, and the mathematical analysis that was, he
understood, a form of love -- the love of a mind trained to describe
the universe in the language the universe seemed to prefer.

Each morning, he walked among his plots. Each morning, the plants were
different. Each observation collapsed a superposition, and each collapse
revealed a possibility that had been waiting, patient and real, for the
act of seeing to call it forth.

The Kepler-62f specimens produced flowers that existed in six distinct
chromatic states, each one associated with a different pollination
strategy adapted to conditions that did not exist on Earth. The Proxima
Centauri b plants grew root structures that branched in fractal patterns
whose dimensions shifted between observations, as though the roots were
exploring multiple soil compositions simultaneously. The Kepler-442b
plant -- the copper-stemmed specimen in plot seven -- developed a
canopy that, in one observed state, was a broad parasol of translucent
leaves, and in another, was a tight spiral of reflective scales, and
in yet another, was a structure that Pavelka could only describe as
architectural: a lattice of interlocking stems that formed something
resembling a small cathedral.

He drew each state. He catalogued them. He gave them names that were
half-scientific and half-poetic, because he had reached the age where
the boundary between those categories had ceased to matter.

He talked to the plants. He told them about his day. He told them
about his daughter, who visited on Saturdays and worried about him.
He told them about his ex-wife, Elena, who had left him in 1958
because he was "married to the universe," which was, he admitted, a
fair description and a legitimate ground for divorce. He told them
about the years at Los Alamos, which he had never told anyone else,
and about the moment when the first test device detonated and he
understood, in a flash that had nothing to do with the light, that the
universe's willingness to reveal its secrets carried no guarantee
that the secrets would be kind.

The plants listened. Or existed. Or superposed. Pavelka found that he
did not need them to respond. He needed them to be there, in all their
multiple, shimmering, possible selves, as proof that the universe was
larger than any single path through it.


                               V.

On a Tuesday in October, he was kneeling in plot three when he noticed
that the Kepler-62f plant had produced, in one of its superposed
states, a fruit.

It was small -- approximately the size of a plum -- and it hung from a
branch that had not been there the previous day. Its skin was a deep
indigo that shifted toward violet at the edges, and it had a faint
luminescence that was visible even in daylight. When Pavelka leaned
close, he could smell it: a scent that was unlike anything in his
experience, simultaneously sweet and metallic, organic and mineral,
as though the fruit existed at the intersection of categories that
terrestrial biology kept separate.

He did not pick it. He sat back on his heels and looked at it and
felt the familiar vertigo of superposition awareness -- the knowledge
that the fruit he was seeing was one of many fruits, one of many
possibilities, one of many realities nested inside the quantum
architecture of a plant that had traveled between stars.

He thought about the other fruits. The ones he was not seeing. The
ones that existed in the unobserved states, real but uncollapsed,
waiting in the probability space for an eye to select them. Were they
larger? Smaller? A different color? Did they taste of something no
human tongue had ever encountered?

He would never know. To observe one was to foreclose the others. That
was the price of measurement, the toll that reality extracted for the
privilege of being specific. You could have one world or you could have
all worlds, but you could not have both. The act of choosing was the
act of losing, and the loss was permanent.

Pavelka sat in his garden and looked at the fruit and understood, with
a clarity that owed nothing to mathematics, what the garden was trying
to teach him.


                               VI.

Marta found him there on Saturday, sitting on the bench with his
notebook closed on his lap and his eyes on the garden.

"You haven't written anything today," she said, glancing at the
notebook.

"No."

She sat beside him. The garden was in its late afternoon state, the
light angled low from the west, and the alien plants caught the light
and scattered it in ways that made the hillside look like a place from
a dream -- not unreal, but more real, hyperreal, a place where the
usual compromises between possibility and actuality had been
temporarily suspended.

"I've been thinking about your mother," Pavelka said.

Marta waited.

"In 1955, I was offered a position at the University of Copenhagen.
The Bohr Institute. It was the most prestigious offer of my career.
Your mother wanted to go. She had family in Denmark. She wanted to
raise you there, near the sea. I turned it down because the work at
Caltech was too important."

He paused.

"In 1958, your mother left. In 1960, she married a man in Copenhagen
and lived there for the rest of her life, near the sea, as she had
wanted."

"I know, Papa."

"In one branch of the wave function, I accepted the Copenhagen offer.
I went with your mother. We raised you in Denmark. I worked at the
Bohr Institute. I published different papers. I attended different
conferences. I had a different life."

He looked at the garden.

"In that branch, I never built this garden. I never planted these
seeds. I never saw the superposition. Another physicist, years from now,
would have discovered it. Or perhaps not. Perhaps the discovery belonged
to this branch, to this particular sequence of choices: the choice to
stay, the choice to lose your mother, the choice to spend forty years
at the same desk, the choice to retire and put alien seeds in the
ground on a hillside above Pasadena."

"Papa--"

"I am not asking for sympathy. I am describing a physical reality. The
many-worlds interpretation tells us that every choice creates a branch.
Every path not taken is taken, somewhere. Every loss is also a gain,
somewhere. Every gain is also a loss. The wave function does not judge.
It does not prefer one outcome to another. It simply branches, and all
branches are equally real."

He opened his notebook to a page he had been working on for weeks. It
was covered in equations that Marta could follow only in their broadest
outlines, but interspersed with the mathematics were sentences --
written in his small, careful hand -- that were not mathematics at all.

"I have been trying to derive a theorem," he said. "A proof that one
branch is better than another. That the choices that led me here --
to this bench, this garden, this conversation with you -- were the
right choices, in some objective, physical sense."

He closed the notebook.

"The theorem does not exist. I cannot prove that this branch is
privileged. I can only observe it. I can only be in it. The fruit on
the Kepler-62f plant is one fruit among many, and it is the only fruit
I will ever taste, and that is the human condition expressed in quantum
mechanical terms: we are particles that have been observed, and the
observation has selected us, and we cannot know what we would have been
if the measurement had gone differently."

Marta took his hand. Her grip was strong -- an engineer's grip, precise
and load-bearing.

"Is that so bad?" she asked.

He smiled.

"It is the most beautiful and terrible thing I know."


                               VII.

Winter came to the garden, or what passed for winter in Pasadena --
a slight cooling, a softening of the light, an occasional rain that
the alien plants received with apparent indifference. Pavelka continued
his observations. The notebooks filled. The plants continued their
impossible, shimmering existence.

He had a visitor in December. Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a young physicist from
MIT who was doing postdoctoral work at Caltech and who had heard,
through the department grapevine, that the emeritus professor on the
hill was doing something unusual with alien plants.

She was thirty, precise, brilliant, and possessed of the particular
intensity that Pavelka recognized because he had once possessed it
himself: the hunger to understand, the impatience with anything that
stood between the mind and the truth.

He showed her the garden. He showed her his notebooks. He explained
the superposition, the observation-collapse dynamics, the mathematical
framework he had developed to describe what was happening. He did
this calmly, carefully, as though he were delivering a lecture, because
delivering a lecture was the thing he knew how to do when the subject
matter exceeded his emotional capacity.

Tanaka listened. She examined the plants. She reviewed the mathematics.
She was silent for a long time.

"This changes everything," she said.

"Yes."

"You have to publish."

"Do I?"

"Professor Pavelka. This is empirical proof of macroscopic quantum
superposition. This is experimental verification of the many-worlds
interpretation. This is--" She stopped, overwhelmed by the implications.
"This is the most important discovery in the history of physics."

"It is plants," Pavelka said. "Growing in dirt."

"It is proof that every possible state is real."

"Yes. Including the state in which this discovery is not made. Including
the state in which I remain a quiet old man with an unusual garden, and
the plants continue to exist in their superposition, and no one turns
them into a technology, and no one uses the technology to choose
between realities, and no one wars over the power to choose."

Tanaka stared at him.

"You're afraid of what we'll do with it."

"I am afraid of what we always do with it. We are a species that turned
nuclear fission into a bomb before we turned it into a power plant. We
are a species that looked at the atom and saw a weapon before we saw
an energy source. And now we have plants that prove every possibility
is real, and I can already see the trajectory: first the papers, then
the grants, then the applications, then the military applications, then
the classified programs, and somewhere at the end of that trajectory,
someone in a uniform will stand in front of a display board and say,
'Gentlemen, we now have the ability to select which reality becomes
real, and the Directorate does not.' And then--"

He gestured at the garden, where the alien plants shimmered in their
multiple states, beautiful and oblivious.

"And then we will have found a new way to fight the same war we have
always been fighting. A war over which version of the world gets to
exist."

Tanaka was quiet for a very long time. Then she said:

"You can't stop it. If not you, then someone else. The survey
expeditions are still bringing back samples. Other botanists, other
physicists, other gardens. The discovery will be made."

"I know."

"Then why?"

Pavelka looked at his garden. The afternoon light was golden, and the
plants caught it and held it and scattered it and became, for a moment,
a single shimmering field of possibility, every leaf a universe, every
branch a choice, every flower an answer to a question that the universe
was asking itself.

"Because it is possible to know a thing and not use it," he said. "It
is possible to understand a power and not exercise it. It is possible
to stand in a garden and see all the possible worlds and choose, simply,
to be in this one. To tend what is here. To water it. To watch it grow.
To let the superposition be, without collapsing it into an instrument."

He paused.

"That is not a solution. It is not even a strategy. It is an old man,
in a garden, on a hill, choosing to let the flowers be flowers."

He bent down and picked up his watering can.

"It is, perhaps, the smallest and most useless act of resistance I can
imagine. But it is mine."


                               VIII.

Spring came. The garden grew. The superposition continued.

Pavelka did not publish. Tanaka, after a week of internal struggle,
honored his wishes and did not publish either. She visited the garden
on Wednesdays, and she and Pavelka worked together on the mathematical
framework -- not for publication, but for understanding. For the pure,
private pleasure of comprehending something extraordinary.

On a morning in April, Pavelka woke early and walked to the garden
before sunrise. The sky was the deep blue of the hour before dawn, and
the air was cool, and the alien plants were doing something he had
never seen before.

They were glowing.

Not with reflected light -- the sun was not yet up. Not with
bioluminescence, exactly, though the effect was similar. The plants
were emitting a soft, steady radiance that came from within, as though
the superposition itself had become visible: a light composed of all
possible lights, blending and separating and blending again in patterns
that moved with the slow rhythm of breathing.

The garden was luminous. Every plant, from every world, contributing
its own frequency to the whole. The Kepler-62f flowers burned a deep
violet. The Proxima Centauri b roots cast a web of amber light across
the soil. The Kepler-442b plant -- the copper-stemmed cathedral-builder
in plot seven -- shone with a white radiance that was so pure it
seemed to contain within it every other color, the way white light
contains the spectrum.

Pavelka stood at the edge of the garden and wept.

He wept for the beauty of it. He wept for the fragility of it. He wept
for the worlds that these plants had come from, worlds that humans had
visited and surveyed and catalogued and would, in time, colonize and
transform and diminish. He wept for his ex-wife in Copenhagen, whom he
had loved and lost and who existed, in some other branch of the wave
function, beside him still. He wept for his daughter, who had grown up
without enough of his attention and who had become, despite this, a
woman of such strength and generosity that the quantum state containing
her was, he believed, the best of all possible states. He wept for
the years at Los Alamos, and for what those years had produced, and for
the world that had been living in the shadow of that production ever
since.

He wept for all the lives he had not lived, and for the one he had.

And then he dried his eyes, and picked up his watering can, and walked
into the garden, and began the day's work.

The sun rose. The glow faded. The plants returned to their ordinary
impossible selves, shimmering at the edges, existing in all states
and none, waiting for the eye that would select them into
specificity.

Pavelka tended them. He watered. He observed. He recorded. He did not
publish.

The garden grew.

                          BURNING LEXICON

                         by Dolores Reyes

================================================================================

                               I.

The first word she burned was querida, which means beloved, which means
the thing you hold closest, which means the thing that breaks you when
it is taken away.

No. That is not right. She did not burn it. Administrator Colton burned
it. Mora Vasquez stood in the courtyard of the colonial education center
in the city the humans called New Carthage and the Telhari called
Keth-an-sol, which meant the-place-where-the-river-remembers, and she
watched while Administrator Colton fed the scrolls into the furnace one
by one, his face wearing the particular expression of a man who believes
he is performing an act of mercy.

"It's for their own good," Colton said, not to Mora but to the air, to
the justification that he carried with him like a second skin. "They
cannot advance while they cling to this. You understand that, Miss
Vasquez. You of all people understand that."

You of all people. She heard what he meant beneath the words. You who
came from a place where this was done before. You who were shaped by
the aftermath. You who carry in your blood the memory of a language
that was beaten out of your grandmother's mouth in a schoolyard in
Texas in 1920, replaced by English, the language of advancement, the
language of progress, the language that opened doors and closed
worlds.

Mora said nothing. She watched the scrolls burn.

They were beautiful, the Telhari scrolls. Not paper -- the Telhari had
never developed paper, which the colonial administrators took as
evidence of primitive development rather than evidence that the Telhari
had found something better. The scrolls were woven from a fiber that
the Telhari harvested from the root systems of the sol-trees that lined
the river valley, a fiber that was simultaneously textile and living
tissue, still connected, through some biochemical process that human
science had not yet explained, to the trees from which it was drawn.
The fiber was pale gold, and when the Telhari wrote on it, they used a
pigment extracted from the same trees -- a deep blue-black ink that
sank into the fibers and became part of them, not resting on the
surface but integrated into the structure of the material, so that the
text and the medium were, in a literal sense, one thing.

The writing itself was unlike anything in human experience. The Telhari
script was not alphabetic, not logographic, not syllabic. It was
gestural. Each character was a record of a physical movement -- the
sweep of a hand, the turn of a wrist, the extension of fingers -- and
the characters were meant to be read not only with the eyes but with
the body. A Telhari reader, encountering a text, would move. Would
gesture. Would recreate, in their own muscles and joints, the movements
that the writer had encoded. The text was a choreography. The reading
was a performance.

And the performance, Mora had come to understand in the two years she
had spent teaching human language to Telhari children, did something
that human text did not do.

When you read Telhari script aloud -- performing the gestures, voicing
the tonal components that accompanied them -- the world changed. Not
metaphorically. Not in the way that a powerful poem changes the
reader's perception of the world. Actually changed. The air shifted
temperature. Colors intensified or faded. Objects moved. Sound altered.
The script was performative in the most radical sense: it did not
describe reality; it edited it.

This was why Colton was burning it.


                               II.

She had come to Keth-an-sol -- to New Carthage -- two years ago, one
of forty-three teachers recruited by the Colonial Education Bureau to
staff the new schools that the administration was building across the
settled regions of Telhar. The mission was straightforward: teach the
Telhari children Standard English, basic mathematics, colonial history,
and the practical skills they would need to participate in the colonial
economy. In return, the Telhari communities would receive access to
human medicine, technology, and the interstellar trade network that was
reshaping the settled worlds.

It was a trade. It was always described as a trade. The Colonial
Education Bureau's literature was full of words like exchange and mutual
benefit and cultural bridge-building, and Mora had read this literature
on the transport from Earth and felt the particular nausea of
recognition, because she had read this language before, in different
documents, from a different century, describing a different project
that had the same shape and the same purpose and the same result.

She took the job anyway. She told herself it was different. She told
herself that she could be the kind of teacher who honored what the
children brought with them, who learned their language as she taught
them hers, who served as a bridge rather than a bulldozer. She told
herself this, and for a while she believed it, and then Colton arrived.

Administrator Colton was a career colonial officer. He was competent,
orderly, and possessed of a certainty about the rightness of the
colonial project that was, Mora thought, his most dangerous quality.
He did not hate the Telhari. He admired them, in the way that a man
admires a beautiful but impractical building that must be demolished
to make way for something useful. He spoke of them with genuine
affection. He had learned enough of their spoken language to conduct
basic conversations, and he displayed Telhari art in his office --
the woven wall-hangings, the carved wood figures, the things that were
safe, decorative, contained.

What he could not tolerate was the script.

He had seen what it could do. He had been present when a Telhari elder,
in the early weeks of contact, had performed a text-reading as a
demonstration of cultural heritage. The elder had unrolled a scroll,
begun the gestures and vocalizations, and the temperature in the room
had dropped twelve degrees. A glass of water on the table had frozen
solid. The shadows on the wall had rearranged themselves into shapes
that did not correspond to any object in the room.

Colton had watched this with the controlled terror of a man whose
understanding of the universe had just been damaged, and he had
responded the way that frightened men in positions of authority
usually responded: he had decided that the thing that frightened him
was the thing that must be controlled.

The Language Directive -- Colonial Administration Order 2247 -- was
issued four months later. It declared the Telhari written language a
Class One Security Hazard and prohibited its teaching, practice, or
display within colonial jurisdiction. Existing texts were to be
collected and destroyed. Telhari citizens found in possession of texts
were subject to detention and re-education.

The order was implemented with the brisk efficiency of bureaucracy.
Colton's staff went door to door through the Telhari communities,
collecting scrolls with the polite insistence of tax assessors.
Most Telhari complied. They had learned, in two years of colonial
administration, that compliance was easier than resistance and that
the humans controlled the medicine, the technology, and the trade
routes. A few resisted. They were detained. They were re-educated.
The word meant what it always means.

Mora watched. She taught her classes. She taught English grammar and
colonial history and the mathematics of the interstellar economy.
She looked into the faces of Telhari children who were learning to
speak a language that was not theirs and forgetting -- being made to
forget -- a language that could reshape the world, and she felt the
ghost of her grandmother sitting beside her, silent and patient and
waiting.


                               III.

The child's name was Sola. She was eight years old, slight even for a
Telhari child, with the large dark eyes common to her people and hands
that were always moving -- tracing shapes in the air, on the desk, on
any available surface, as though the gestures were a pulse that could
not be stilled.

Mora noticed her in the second week after the Language Directive.

The other children had adapted, as children do, to the new prohibition.
They stopped making the gestures in public. They stopped drawing the
characters in their notebooks. They spoke English with increasing
fluency and learned to answer questions about colonial history in the
approved manner. They were becoming, in the bureau's language,
integrated.

Sola was not becoming integrated. Sola was becoming invisible, which
was different. She sat in the back of the classroom and said nothing
and watched everything and moved her hands beneath the desk in patterns
that Mora recognized, after two years of immersion, as script-gestures.

The child was writing. Silently, under the desk, out of sight. She
was writing in the forbidden language, and the air around her desk was
fractionally cooler than the air in the rest of the room, and the light
that fell on her hands had a quality that Mora could not name -- a
density, a saturation, as though the light itself were paying attention.

Mora said nothing. She continued her lesson. She did not look at
Sola's hands.

After class, she found Sola in the courtyard, sitting beneath one of
the ornamental trees that the colonial administration had planted to
replace the sol-trees that had been cleared for the education center's
construction. The child was still moving her hands.

Mora sat beside her. She said nothing for a while. The courtyard was
quiet. The other children had gone.

"You are writing," Mora said, in Telhari. Her spoken Telhari was
imperfect but functional, and she chose it deliberately -- a small act
of defiance that she could, if questioned, justify as pedagogical
methodology.

Sola looked at her. The child's eyes held the particular wariness of
someone who has learned, very young, that the wrong word in the wrong
ear can bring consequences.

"I am remembering," Sola said.

"What are you remembering?"

"The words of my grandmother. She was a keeper. She knew the old texts.
She taught me before the order came."

Mora felt the ghost beside her stir.

"A keeper," she repeated. "What does a keeper do?"

"A keeper holds the words. When the scrolls are gone, the keeper holds
the words in her body. In her hands. In her voice. The words live in
the keeper until they can be written again."

The child's hands moved, and the air shifted, and for a moment -- just
a moment -- the ornamental tree beside them flickered, and in the
flicker Mora saw, or thought she saw, a different tree: taller, older,
with bark the color of beaten copper and roots that went deep into a
soil that remembered what had grown there before the humans came.

The flicker passed. The ornamental tree was an ornamental tree again.

Sola looked at Mora with eyes that were too old for an eight-year-old
face.

"Will you tell them?" the child asked.

Mora looked at Sola's hands. She looked at the ornamental tree. She
looked at the education center, where the furnace chimney still trailed
a thin line of smoke from the morning's burning.

"No," she said. "I will not tell them."


                               IV.

That night, Mora sat in her quarters and thought about fire.

She thought about the fires at the boarding schools in Oklahoma and
Arizona and New Mexico, where the children's clothes were burned when
they arrived -- the blankets, the moccasins, the beaded shirts --
replaced by uniforms that said: you are no longer what you were. She
thought about the fires in the schoolyards where the children's
notebooks were burned when they were caught writing in Navajo or
Cherokee or Lakota, their hands struck with rulers until the lesson
was clear: your words are not words. She thought about the fire in her
grandmother's memory, which Abuela had carried for sixty years and
which she had passed to Mora in the kitchen of the house in El Paso,
stirring beans and saying, in the Spanish she had refused to give up
and the English she had been forced to adopt, "They took the language
from my mother's mouth, mija. They said it was for her own good. They
always say it is for your own good."

She thought about Colton's furnace.

She thought about Sola's hands.

And then she did the thing that she had been moving toward since the
day she arrived on this world, the thing that her grandmother's ghost
had been waiting for her to do, the thing that was the reason she had
come here even though she had not known it was the reason until now.

She began to plan.


                               V.

The plan was simple in the way that dangerous things are simple. She
would learn the script. She would learn it from Sola, who had learned
it from her grandmother, who had learned it from her grandmother before
her, in a chain of transmission that went back further than human
history on this world, further than human history anywhere. She would
learn it, and she would write it down, and she would hide what she had
written in a place where Colton's officers would not find it.

She would become a keeper.

The lessons began the next week. They were conducted in secret, in the
hour between the end of classes and the evening meal, in a storage room
at the back of the education center that no one used because it was
full of broken furniture and outdated teaching materials. Sola taught.
Mora learned.

It was the hardest thing Mora had ever done.

The Telhari script was not designed for human hands. The gestures
required a range of motion and a precision that the Telhari achieved
naturally but that humans had to practice for hours to approximate.
Mora's wrists ached. Her fingers cramped. She made gestures that were
close but not right, and the difference between close and right was
the difference between a sentence and silence.

"Again," Sola said, with the patient severity of a child who is, in
this domain, the master.

Mora repeated the gesture. Her hand swept down, turned, extended. The
air did not change. Nothing happened.

"Your wrist," Sola said. "It is too stiff. The word cannot move through
a stiff wrist. The word needs to flow. Like water. Like the river."

Mora tried again. And again. And again. On the twelfth attempt, she
felt something -- a resistance in the air, a thickening, as though
the space around her hand had become denser -- and Sola smiled for
the first time since Mora had known her.

"There," the child said. "You felt it. The word is beginning to know
you."

Mora looked at her hand. It tingled. The air around it was fractionally
warmer than the rest of the room.

"What did I write?" she asked.

"You wrote sol," Sola said. "It means many things. River. Memory. The
thing-that-flows-and-does-not-forget."

Mora felt something unlock inside her chest. It was a feeling she
recognized but had not felt in a long time: the feeling of a language
entering the body, not through the ears or the eyes but through the
hands and the muscles and the bones, the way her grandmother's Spanish
had entered her, not as vocabulary but as rhythm, as gesture, as the
shape of the mouth when it forms the words that mean home.

"Teach me more," she said.


                               VI.

The weeks passed. Mora learned.

She learned the basic gestures -- the twenty-seven root movements from
which all Telhari text was composed. She learned how the gestures
combined, how the movement of one hand modified the movement of the
other, how the vocal components -- the tonal accompaniment that the
Telhari produced from deep in the throat -- changed the meaning and
the effect of the gestural text. She learned that the script had
levels: a surface level that communicated meaning in the way that human
text communicated meaning, and a deep level that communicated something
else entirely -- a direct interface between the writer's intention and
the physical structure of reality.

She learned that the deep level was what Colton was afraid of.

At the surface level, the script was a language. Beautiful,
sophisticated, unlike anything in human linguistics, but a language.
At the deep level, the script was a technology. Not a technology in the
human sense -- not a tool, not an instrument, not a device -- but a
technology in the sense that it was a systematic method for producing
specific effects in the physical world. The Telhari had not developed
machines because they had developed something more fundamental: a way
of speaking that the universe listened to.

And the universe, Mora learned, listened very carefully.

On the night she first performed a complete text -- a simple one, a
text that the Telhari taught to children as a first exercise -- the
storage room changed. The broken furniture mended itself. Not all at
once, not dramatically. The legs straightened. The joints tightened.
The cracks in the wood sealed. It happened slowly, over the course of
a minute, as Mora's gestures moved through the air and her voice
carried the tonal accompaniment that Sola had taught her, and when she
finished, the room was no longer full of broken things.

Mora stood in the mended room and shook.

"Now you understand," Sola said, quietly.

"How?" Mora's voice was a whisper. "How is this possible?"

"My grandmother said that the words came first. Before the river.
Before the sol-trees. Before the Telhari. The words were already here,
in the shape of the world, and the first keepers did not invent the
script -- they discovered it. They learned to read what was already
written in the way the rivers flowed and the way the trees grew and
the way the light fell on the water. And then they learned to write
back."

Sola looked at the mended furniture with the calm acceptance of a
child raised in a world where words had weight.

"The humans think we are primitive because we do not have machines. But
we do not need machines. We have words that work."


                               VII.

Mora began to write.

Not on Telhari fiber -- the fiber was gone, burned or confiscated,
the sol-trees that produced it cleared for colonial development. She
wrote on what she had: paper. Human paper, manufactured on Earth,
shipped across the stars, intended for lesson plans and attendance
reports and the bureaucratic documentation of cultural destruction.

The script did not work as well on paper. The words did not sink in,
did not integrate, did not become part of the medium. They sat on the
surface, inert, like a song transcribed into notation -- the structure
was there, but the music was gone. When Mora performed from her paper
transcriptions, the effects were weaker: a slight temperature shift, a
faint change in the light, nothing that would attract attention.

But the words were preserved. That was what mattered. Each evening,
after the lessons with Sola, Mora returned to her quarters and
transcribed what she had learned. The root gestures. The combinations.
The tonal accompaniments. The deep-level texts that the keepers had
maintained for generations. She wrote them in a notation system that
she invented herself -- a hybrid of standard phonetic transcription,
Laban dance notation, and musical scoring that captured, as well as
any flat medium could, the three-dimensional, time-extended,
multi-modal reality of the Telhari script.

She hid the pages in the lining of her suitcase, in the false bottom
of a drawer, in the binding of a textbook. She distributed them, so
that no single discovery would mean the loss of everything.

She was afraid. She was afraid constantly. Colton's security officers
conducted random inspections of staff quarters. If they found the
pages, if they understood what the notation represented, Mora would be
dismissed at minimum, detained at worst. She would lose her position,
her salary, her ability to remain on this world. She would lose Sola.

She continued anyway.

She thought about her grandmother, who had continued to speak Spanish
in the house in El Paso after the schoolyard, after the ruler, after
the lesson that said your language is not a language. Abuela had
continued because the alternative was silence, and silence was a form
of death that did not require the body's cooperation.

Mora wrote. She hid. She taught her classes by day and learned the
forbidden script by night and lived, as she had always lived, in the
space between: between languages, between worlds, between the thing
she was paid to do and the thing she had to do.


                               VIII.

They came for Sola's grandmother on a Wednesday.

Mora was in the classroom when she heard the transport. She went to
the window and saw the colonial security vehicle pulling up to the
Telhari settlement at the edge of town -- the cluster of traditional
dwellings that the administration had not yet replaced with standard
colonial housing because the budget allocation had not been approved.

She watched two officers enter the settlement. She watched them emerge
fifteen minutes later with an elderly Telhari woman walking between
them. The woman was small and straight-backed and she walked with the
particular dignity of someone who had been expecting this and had
decided, in advance, how she would meet it.

Sola was in the classroom. Sola saw.

The child did not cry. She did not make a sound. She sat at her desk
and her hands moved beneath it, writing in the air, and the
temperature in the classroom dropped, and the light changed, and Mora
felt, for the first time, the deep-level script at full power: not
the mended furniture, not the slight temperature shift, but the real
thing, the thing that Colton was afraid of, the thing that had frozen
a glass of water and rearranged shadows.

The windows of the classroom cracked. All of them. Simultaneously.
Fine, web-like fractures that spread across the glass in patterns that
were, Mora realized with a shock of recognition, script. The cracks
were forming characters. The windows were being written on by the
force of a child's grief moving through a language that the universe
listened to.

Mora moved quickly. She went to Sola's desk. She knelt. She took the
child's hands, stilling them.

"Sola. Stop."

The child's eyes were dark and enormous and full of something that Mora
recognized because she had seen it in her grandmother's eyes, in old
photographs, in the faces of the women at the boarding school reunions
that Abuela had taken her to once, when Mora was ten, so that she
would see and remember and understand.

"They took her," Sola said.

"I know."

"She is the last keeper. The last real keeper. I am too young. I know
some of the words, but she knows all of them. All of them, Mora. Every
text. Every song. Every word that has been spoken since the beginning.
And they will take the words from her the way they took the scrolls.
They will put her in a room and they will make her forget."

Mora held the child's hands. She felt the words moving in them, the
deep-level script pulsing like a heartbeat beneath the skin.

"She will not forget," Mora said. "And you will not forget. And I will
not forget. I have it written down, Sola. Not all of it. Not enough.
But some. And we will get more. And we will keep it."

"Paper is not the same."

"No. It is not the same. But it is something. And something is better
than nothing, and nothing is what they want us to have."

Sola looked at her teacher. The cracks in the windows held their
script-patterns, frozen, beautiful, illegible to anyone who did not
know what they were looking at.

"You sound like my grandmother," Sola said.

Mora smiled. "I sound like mine."


                               IX.

She went to Colton that evening.

She went not to argue, not to plead, not to appeal to the mercy that
she knew he possessed in a general way but that did not extend to
the specific situation of an alien language that frightened him. She
went to understand, because understanding was the first step in every
form of resistance that she had ever learned.

Colton was in his office. He was drinking coffee and reviewing
requisition forms. He looked tired. He looked, Mora thought, like a
man who was carrying out a policy that cost him something, though not
enough.

"Miss Vasquez. Sit down."

She sat.

"I assume this is about the elder. Sola's grandmother."

"Grandmother-keeper," Mora said, using the Telhari term. "Nen-ka-sol."

"Yes. She was maintaining prohibited materials. Script materials. In
violation of the Language Directive."

"She is an old woman. She was maintaining her memory."

"Her memory is the prohibited material, Miss Vasquez. That is precisely
the problem. The script is not just on the scrolls. It is in the
people. In their hands, their voices, their bodies. You cannot burn a
memory the way you can burn a scroll."

He paused, and something moved behind his eyes that Mora could not
read.

"We are not monsters, Miss Vasquez. We are administrators. We have been
given responsibility for a population that possesses a capability --
a weapon, though they do not use it as one -- that is incompatible
with colonial security. A language that alters physical reality is not
a cultural artifact. It is a strategic asset. And strategic assets
must be controlled."

"It is not a weapon."

"The windows of your classroom suggest otherwise."

Mora said nothing. He knew about the windows. Of course he knew about
the windows.

"The child will be monitored," Colton said. "For her own safety. And
for the safety of the community. We are not punishing her. We are
protecting everyone."

"You are destroying a language."

"We are managing a transition. The Telhari will learn Standard. They
will participate in the colonial economy. They will have medicine and
technology and trade. In two generations, the script will be a
historical curiosity, studied by linguists, preserved in archives. No
one will be hurt by its passing."

"Everyone will be hurt by its passing."

Colton looked at her with something that was not quite pity and not
quite condescension but occupied the territory between them.

"Miss Vasquez, I have read your file. I know about your family history.
I understand that you see parallels. But the situations are not the
same. The Navajo language does not alter physical reality. The Telhari
script does. That difference matters."

"The difference matters," Mora agreed. "But not in the way you think.
The Navajo language did alter reality. Not the way the Telhari script
does. Not by changing the temperature or cracking windows. But by
carrying a world inside it -- a way of seeing, a way of knowing, a way
of being in relation to the land and the sky and the water and the
people. And when that language was taken, that world was taken with it.
And the world that replaced it was smaller."

She stood.

"You think you are removing a danger, Administrator. You are removing
a world."

She left his office. She walked across the courtyard, past the furnace
that still smelled of ash, past the ornamental trees that were not
sol-trees, past the cracked windows of her classroom, to the storage
room at the back of the education center.

She sat in the dark among the mended furniture and she moved her hands
in the air.

She wrote sol. River. Memory. The-thing-that-flows-and-does-not-forget.

The air warmed. The light shifted. The mended chairs creaked softly,
as though remembering the shape of the people who had once sat in them.

Mora wrote.


                               X.

They released Sola's grandmother three weeks later. The old woman
returned to the settlement walking slowly, diminished, her hands still.
They had not harmed her physically. They had been, in their way,
gentle. They had simply insisted, with the patient repetition of
re-education, that the words were dangerous and the gestures must stop
and the future was English and the past was a beautiful thing that had
no place in the present.

Nen-ka-sol sat in her dwelling and did not speak for three days.

On the fourth day, Mora brought Sola to see her.

The old woman looked at the child. The child looked at the old woman.
Something passed between them that was not language -- or that was
language at a level deeper than any specific system of signs, the
prelinguistic recognition of one keeper by another across the gulf of
what had been done to them.

Nen-ka-sol raised her hands. They trembled. They moved. They formed,
slowly, painfully, the gesture for sol.

The air warmed.

Sola's eyes filled.

Mora knelt beside them and placed her own hands in the space between
the old woman's hands and the child's hands, and she moved, and she
wrote, and the three of them -- the grandmother, the child, the
stranger from across the stars who carried her own grandmother's ghost
in her blood -- wrote together in the forbidden language, and the
air changed, and the light changed, and for a moment the dwelling was
not a dwelling but a grove of sol-trees, copper-barked and ancient,
their roots in the river, their branches in the sky, their sap flowing
with words that had been spoken since before the humans came, since
before the Telhari built their cities, since before the river learned
its name.

The moment passed. The dwelling was a dwelling again. The grove was
gone.

But the words remained. In the old woman's hands. In the child's
hands. In Mora's hands, imperfect and human and reaching.

In the pages hidden in the suitcase, in the drawer, in the textbook.

In the cracks in the classroom windows, where the script was written
in glass and could not be burned.

Mora looked at the old woman and the child and she thought: this is
what they never understand, the administrators, the colonizers, the
men who build furnaces and issue directives and believe that a language
can be destroyed by burning its material form. They never understand
that a language is not a thing. It is a practice. It is a relationship
between a body and a world. And as long as there is a body that
remembers the movements and a world that listens to them, the language
lives.

They will have to kill every body.

They will have to deafen every world.

And even then -- even then -- the words will be waiting, patient and
ancient, in the shape of the rivers and the grain of the wood and the
pattern of the light on the water, for the hands that will find them
again.

Mora held Sola's hand. The child's fingers traced sol in her palm.

River. Memory.

The-thing-that-flows-and-does-not-forget.

                        TOMORROW'S VINTAGE

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The grapes came in late on Thessaly.

Martin Kessler stood at the edge of his vineyard and watched the dawn
come up over the eastern ridge, painting the alien sky in colors that
were almost right -- the blue a shade too deep, the orange at the
horizon a fraction too vivid, as though the planet were trying to
reproduce an Earth sunset from a description rather than from memory.
He had been on Thessaly for eleven years, and the sky still looked like
a painting of a sky rather than the real thing. He supposed it always
would.

The vines were heavy with fruit. That, at least, was real. He walked
the rows, checking the clusters, pressing his thumb against the skins
to gauge the sugar content the way his father had taught him in the
Finger Lakes forty years ago. The grapes were Earth stock -- Pinot Noir,
brought from France to New York to the stars in a journey that would
have made the old Burgundian monks weep with wonder or rage -- but they
had changed. Eleven years in Thessaly's soil had changed them in ways
that no one had predicted and that Kessler was still learning to
understand.

The soil was the thing. Thessaly's soil was rich in compounds that had
no terrestrial analogue -- complex organic molecules produced by the
planet's native microbiology, which had been doing its quiet work in
this dirt for billions of years before the first human transport touched
down. The Colony Agricultural Service had tested the soil exhaustively
before clearing the region for farming, and the tests had come back
favorable: no toxins, no pathogens, excellent mineral content, pH
within acceptable range. The soil was, by every measurable standard,
good dirt.

What the tests had not measured was what the soil did to the grapes.

It was the same thing it did to everything that grew in it. Thessaly's
native microbiology -- the web of fungal networks and bacterial
colonies that permeated the soil to a depth of several meters -- had
a peculiar property: it integrated with the root systems of non-native
plants, forming symbiotic relationships that altered the plant's
chemistry in subtle but significant ways. Thessaly's carrots tasted
slightly different from Earth carrots. Thessaly's wheat produced flour
with an unusual protein structure. Thessaly's tomatoes were, by
universal consensus, the best tomatoes anyone had ever eaten.

And Thessaly's wine did something that no one had expected.

Kessler had discovered it with the first vintage, seven years ago. He
had pressed the grapes, fermented the juice, aged the wine in oak
barrels he had brought from Earth at ruinous expense, and produced
fifty bottles of what he expected would be a drinkable but unremarkable
Pinot Noir. He had opened the first bottle on a Tuesday evening, poured
a glass, and sat on his porch and tasted it.

The wine was extraordinary. Not in the way that great wines are usually
extraordinary -- not in complexity of flavor, not in balance, not in
the interplay of fruit and acid and tannin that wine critics spent
their careers chasing. The wine was extraordinary because when Kessler
drank it, he remembered.

Not vaguely. Not in the soft-focus way that a smell or a song can
trigger a memory. He remembered with absolute, crystalline, total
fidelity. He was sitting on his porch on Thessaly and he was also
standing in his father's vineyard in the Finger Lakes, thirty-five
years old, the sun on the back of his neck, his father beside him,
alive, whole, his hands stained with grape juice, saying, "The soil
talks to the vine, Martin. You just have to learn to listen." The
memory was not a recollection. It was a visitation. His father was
there. The vineyard was there. The smell of the earth and the warmth
of the sun and the sound of his father's voice were there, fully
realized, indistinguishable from the present.

The memory lasted for perhaps thirty seconds. Then it faded, gently,
like a wave retreating from a shore, and Kessler was on his porch on
Thessaly again, with the alien sky above him and the taste of wine on
his tongue and tears on his face.

He sat for a long time after that. Then he poured another glass.


                               II.

He told his neighbor first. Eva Marchetti ran the next farm over --
eighty acres of wheat and vegetables, a practical woman with no
patience for nonsense and a laugh that could be heard across three
fields. She was fifty, Italian-born, had come to Thessaly with her
husband, who had died in the second year of a stroke, and had stayed
because the farm was her life and because, she said, "I did not come
all this way to go back."

Kessler brought her a bottle. Eva opened it with the matter-of-fact
efficiency she brought to everything, poured two glasses, and drank.

She was quiet for a very long time.

When she spoke, her voice was different. Softer. Younger.

"I was in my mother's kitchen," she said. "I was nine years old. She
was making bread. The flour was on her hands and she was singing. I
could smell the bread. I could feel the floor under my feet -- the
cold tile. I could hear my mother singing."

She put down the glass. Her eyes were wet.

"My mother has been dead for twenty years, Martin."

"I know."

"It was real. It was not like a memory. It was real."

"I know."

They sat together on Eva's porch and drank the wine and visited their
pasts, and the pasts visited them, and neither of them spoke about it
in terms that a scientist would have used -- neurotransmitter
modulation, hippocampal activation, memory consolidation enhancement --
because those terms, however accurate, would have diminished what they
were experiencing. They were not having enhanced memories. They were
being given the past. The full, unedited, living past, returned to
them with a fidelity that was impossible and real.

Kessler brought bottles to other neighbors. The results were the same.
Thessaly's wine unlocked perfect recall -- not of everything, but of
the moments that mattered most, the memories that the mind had marked
as significant and then, as minds do, allowed to soften and fade. The
wine reversed the fading. It restored the original.

Word spread. Word, on a colony world, always spreads.

By the end of the first year, Kessler was producing two hundred bottles
per vintage, and the demand exceeded the supply by a factor he couldn't
calculate. Colonists came from across the settlement region. They
brought their own glasses. They sat in Kessler's tasting room -- a
converted barn with wooden benches and a view of the vineyard -- and
they drank, and they wept, and they remembered.

A man who had lost his daughter to a transport accident sat at the bar
and held his glass with both hands and saw his daughter's face, not as
a photograph, not as a reconstruction, but as the living face of a
four-year-old girl who had held up a crayon drawing and said, "Daddy,
look what I made." He sat there for an hour. He did not want to stop
seeing her.

A woman who had left Earth at twenty-two and never returned sat in the
corner and tasted her grandmother's cooking, heard her grandmother's
voice, felt the particular weight of a summer afternoon in a place she
had chosen to leave and could never go back to.

An old man who had fought in the Proxima campaign drank a glass and
then set it down very carefully and walked out of the barn and did not
come back.

Kessler found him later, sitting behind the barn, staring at nothing.

"I can't drink that," the old man said. His voice was level and
controlled in the way that voices are level and controlled when the
alternative is screaming. "I don't want to remember. I left those
memories behind. I buried them. I built a life on top of them. And
that wine digs them up."

Kessler looked at the old man's hands. They were shaking.

"Not everyone's past is a gift, Mr. Kessler. Some of us have pasts
that we survived. We don't want to go back. We can't afford to go
back."

Kessler thought about this for a long time after the old man left.
He thought about it through the second vintage and the third. He
thought about it while the demand for his wine grew beyond anything
he could meet, and while the Colony Agricultural Service sent
researchers to study his soil and his grapes and the peculiar chemistry
that produced the effect, and while the word spread beyond Thessaly to
the other colonies and then to Earth.

He thought about it, and he began to understand that he had created
something that was both a treasure and a weapon, and that the
difference between the two depended entirely on the person holding
the glass.


                               III.

The government man arrived on a Thursday.

His name was Aldridge. He was from the Bureau of Controlled Substances,
which was a division of the Colonial Health Authority, which was a
department of the federal government that administered the colonial
territories. He was thin, precise, and polite in the way that
government men are polite when they are about to tell you something
you do not want to hear.

"Mr. Kessler, I'll come directly to the point. The Bureau has been
studying the reports coming out of Thessaly regarding your wine's
properties. We've conducted our own analysis. The compound responsible
for the memory-enhancement effect has been identified. It's a complex
alkaloid produced by the interaction of the Pinot Noir grape's natural
chemistry with the symbiotic microbiology of Thessaly's soil."

"I know what it is. I grow it."

"Yes. The Bureau has determined that this compound meets the criteria
for classification as a controlled substance under Section 14 of the
Colonial Health Code."

Kessler stared at him. "You're classifying my wine."

"We're classifying the active compound. The wine that contains it will
be subject to production controls, distribution licensing, and
prescriptive-use regulations."

"It's wine."

"It's a psychoactive compound that produces profound neurological
effects. The Bureau has documented cases of adverse reaction. Post-
traumatic stress episodes triggered by involuntary recall. Dissociative
states. At least one case of acute psychological crisis requiring
hospitalization."

Kessler thought of the old man behind the barn. The shaking hands.

"I know about the adverse effects," he said.

"Then you understand the need for regulation."

"I understand the need for caution. I don't understand the need for
the government to tell me how to make wine."

Aldridge had the decency to look uncomfortable. "Mr. Kessler, this
isn't about wine. You know that. This is about a substance that can
force a person to relive their most significant memories with total
fidelity. For most people, that's a beautiful experience. For some
people, it's torture. And for certain categories of people --
intelligence personnel, for instance, or individuals with classified
knowledge -- it presents a security concern."

Kessler felt something cold settle in his stomach.

"A security concern."

"If the wine forces total recall, it forces recall of everything.
Including things that certain individuals have been trained to
compartmentalize. Things that are classified."

"You're telling me the military is worried about my wine."

"I'm telling you that the Bureau's recommendation is being made on
public health grounds. The military's concerns are separate and are
being addressed through separate channels."

"And if I refuse to accept the classification?"

Aldridge's politeness did not waver. "The classification is not
optional, Mr. Kessler. It's being implemented. I'm here as a courtesy,
to explain the process and to ensure your cooperation."

Kessler looked out the window at his vineyard. The vines were heavy
with fruit. The sun was making its way across the alien sky. Somewhere
in that soil, billions of years of microbiology were doing what they
had always done, and the grapes were absorbing it, and the wine would
do what it did, regardless of what any bureau classified it as.

"The grapes don't know they're a controlled substance, Mr. Aldridge."

"No. But the grapes don't have a choice. You do."


                               IV.

He thought about compliance.

He was a practical man. He had been a practical man his entire life --
a farmer's son who had become a farmer, who had traveled to the stars
to farm because the land on Earth was crowded and expensive and because
he had wanted to see if grapes would grow under a different sun. He was
not a rebel. He was not a philosopher. He was a man who understood soil
and weather and the patient chemistry of fermentation, and who wanted
to be left alone to practice his craft.

He thought about compliance, and he thought about what compliance meant.

It meant licensing. It meant inspectors. It meant production quotas
and distribution records and bureaucratic oversight of every bottle
he produced. It meant that the wine -- his wine, grown in his soil,
from his vines, pressed by his hands -- would be treated as a
pharmaceutical product rather than a craft, dispensed by prescription
rather than by the glass, controlled by a government that saw the
memory of a dead daughter's face as a dosage to be regulated.

It meant that Eva Marchetti would need a license to drink wine with
her dinner and remember her mother's kitchen.

It meant that the old man behind the barn would be protected from
his memories, which was perhaps a kindness. And it meant that the man
who lost his daughter would be protected from his memories too, which
was not a kindness at all but a cruelty so refined that the
bureaucracy would not recognize it as one.

He thought about all of this, and then he went out to his vineyard
and walked the rows, pressing his thumb against the skins of the
grapes, feeling the sugar, judging the readiness.

The grapes were ready. They were always ready. Readiness was what
grapes did.


                               V.

He made the wine. He made it the way he always had: by hand, with
the care and attention that his father had taught him, in the oak
barrels he had brought from Earth. He made five hundred bottles. It
was the largest vintage he had ever produced.

He did not apply for a production license. He did not register with
the Bureau. He did not fill out the forms that Aldridge had left with
him, the forms that would have transformed his vineyard from a farm
into a regulated production facility and his wine from a craft into a
controlled substance.

Instead, he gave the wine away.

He loaded the bottles into his truck and drove them to every farm,
every homestead, every settlement in the region. He left bottles on
porches. He handed them to neighbors. He brought them to the community
hall, where colonists gathered on Saturday evenings for the dances and
dinners and arguments that constituted the social life of a colony
world, and he set them on the tables and said, "From my vineyard.
For your memories."

He was not making a political statement. He was not mounting a
resistance. He was giving his neighbors wine. It was, he felt, the
most basic thing a winemaker could do, and the fact that a government
bureau had determined that this basic act was now illegal did not
change its essential nature.

The colonists drank. They remembered. They wept and laughed and sat
in silence with their pasts, and the Saturday evening at the community
hall became something that Kessler had not intended: a communion. A
room full of people sharing, not the wine, but the memories that the
wine released -- trading stories of the things they had seen, the
people they had loved, the places they had left. For one evening, the
colony was not a collection of individual homesteads struggling against
alien soil. It was a community bound by the shared experience of
remembering.

Eva Marchetti sat beside him. She had drunk two glasses and her eyes
were bright with the particular light that came from having visited
a place that existed now only in memory.

"You're going to be in trouble, Martin."

"I know."

"The Bureau will send someone."

"I know."

"What will you tell them?"

Kessler looked at the room. At the colonists with their glasses and
their tears and their memories. At the man who had lost his daughter,
who was sitting alone at a corner table with an empty glass and a
expression of such peaceful grief that it looked almost like joy.

"I'll tell them the truth. That I'm a winemaker. That I make wine.
That wine is meant to be drunk, not regulated. That memory is not a
controlled substance. That the past belongs to the people who lived it,
not to the government that administers the present."

"They won't accept that."

"No. They won't."

He poured himself a glass. He drank. He was in the Finger Lakes. He
was thirty-five. His father was beside him. The sun was on the back
of his neck and the earth was under his feet and his father was saying,
"The soil talks to the vine, Martin. You just have to learn to listen."

The memory faded. He was on Thessaly again. The alien sky. The alien
stars.

But the taste remained.


                               VI.

They came for him on a Monday.

Not Aldridge this time. Three officers from the Colonial Health
Authority, accompanied by a legal representative who carried a
clipboard and a cease-and-desist order and the particular expression
of a person who is doing their job and wishes their job were different.

They confiscated the remaining bottles. They tagged the vineyard as
a controlled-substance production site. They informed Kessler that he
was prohibited from producing, distributing, or possessing wine made
from Thessaly-grown grapes until such time as the Bureau's
classification process was complete and appropriate licenses had been
issued.

Kessler stood in his vineyard and watched them load the bottles into
their transport. The vines hung heavy around him, fruit ripening in
the alien sun, the soil doing what it had done for billions of years,
indifferent to the documents and the officers and the legal apparatus
that had descended on it.

The legal representative handed him the cease-and-desist. "Mr. Kessler,
I want you to understand that this action is being taken for public
health and safety reasons. The classification process is expected to
take six to nine months. Once complete, you will have the opportunity
to apply for a licensed production permit."

"And if the classification stands?"

"Then production will be permitted under regulated conditions.
Distribution will require a prescription from a licensed mental health
professional. Dosage -- that is, serving size -- will be controlled."

"You want people to get a prescription for wine."

"For the active compound in the wine. Yes."

Kessler looked at the officer. The officer was young, earnest, and
genuinely believed in the necessity of what he was doing. This, Kessler
had learned, was how the most damaging things were done: by people who
genuinely believed.

"Son," Kessler said. "My father made wine. His father made wine. His
father before him made wine. They made it from grapes that grew in
soil that was different from every other soil on Earth, and the wine
tasted like the place it came from, and people drank it and remembered
what it meant to be alive. That's what wine does. That's what it's
for."

He gestured at the vineyard. At the soil. At the sky.

"This soil talks to these vines. The vines listen. The wine remembers.
And when people drink it, they remember too. You can classify that.
You can regulate it. You can put it behind a prescription counter. But
you cannot change what it is. It is memory, made liquid. And you cannot
-- you cannot -- control what people remember."

The officer filed his report. The transport left. Kessler stood in his
vineyard and watched it go.

The grapes hung heavy on the vines. The soil did what it did. The sun
made its way across the alien sky, and the shadows lengthened, and
somewhere in the roots of the vines the ancient microbiology of
Thessaly continued its patient work, unaware and unconcerned that it
had been classified, categorized, and controlled by a species that had
arrived yesterday and would be gone tomorrow.

Kessler picked a grape. He put it in his mouth. He tasted the juice,
warm from the sun, sweet with the sugar that the vine had drawn up
from the soil, laced with the compound that the Bureau of Controlled
Substances had identified and catalogued and feared.

He tasted it, and he remembered.

Everything.

                        PHANTOM CONTINENTS

================================================================================

                               I.

Consider the Library of Alexandria. Not the Library that burned -- that
is the Library you know, the Library of your timeline, the great wound
in the memory of the Western world. Consider instead the Library that
did not burn. The Library that survived.

In your history, Julius Caesar's troops set fire to the docks in
48 BC, and the flames spread to the warehouses, and from the
warehouses to the Library, and seven hundred thousand scrolls -- the
accumulated knowledge of the ancient world -- were reduced to ash. This
is the story you were told. This is the divergence point.

In another history -- in the history that concerns us here -- the wind
shifted.

That is all. A change in the wind. The fire burned the docks and the
warehouses but did not reach the Library. Caesar's soldiers, finding
the warehouses destroyed and the port in chaos, withdrew. The Library
endured. And because the Library endured, certain things happened
differently.

This is a story about those differences. It is also a story about a
man who discovered them.


                               II.

His name was Etienne Valmonde, and he was a cartographer in the court
of Philip IV of France, and in the year 1308, he received a commission
that would dismantle his understanding of the world.

Valmonde was forty-three years old, a precise and meticulous man whose
maps were prized for their accuracy and their beauty. He had spent
twenty years surveying the provinces of France, the coastlines of the
Mediterranean, and the interior of the Holy Land (which he had visited
during the final, dispirited Crusade of 1291, mapping the roads that
the retreating armies used). His maps were works of art -- the
coastlines rendered in flowing ink, the mountains shaded with the
delicacy of a miniaturist, the distances calibrated against the best
astronomical observations available. He was, by the standards of his
age, a man of science, though the age did not yet have a word for
what he was.

The commission came from the Royal Library, which had recently acquired,
through a series of diplomatic exchanges with the Caliph of Egypt, a
collection of documents from the Library of Alexandria.

In your timeline, this sentence is impossible. In Valmonde's timeline,
the Library of Alexandria was the oldest and largest repository of
knowledge in the world, still operating after thirteen centuries, still
accumulating, still growing. The Muslim conquest of Egypt in the
seventh century had not destroyed it -- the Caliph Omar, who in your
timeline reportedly ordered the scrolls used as fuel for the city's
bathhouses, had in Valmonde's timeline been dissuaded by his advisors,
who argued that the Library's contents might be useful. (The advisors
were correct. The Library's astronomical and mathematical texts
accelerated Islamic science by several centuries, with consequences
that rippled across the world.)

The documents that arrived in Paris in 1308 were copies -- the
Alexandrian librarians never released originals -- and they were
written in a variety of languages: Greek, Latin, Arabic, Coptic,
Hebrew, and several that the Royal Library's scholars could not
identify. The commission asked Valmonde to examine the geographical
texts and produce translations of any maps or navigational charts.

Valmonde accepted. He settled into a workroom in the Royal Library,
surrounded by crates of documents, and began to read.

What he found changed everything.


                               III.

The maps were unlike anything in the European tradition.

They were drawn on papyrus of exceptional quality -- a Alexandrian
specialty, produced by a technique that had been refined over thirteen
centuries and that produced sheets of remarkable durability and
smoothness. The ink was a deep black that had not faded despite the
documents' age, and the lines were drawn with a precision that
Valmonde found astonishing. These were not the approximations of
medieval European cartography, with its blend of observation and
imagination, its sea monsters and its terrae incognitae. These were
maps of a rigor and specificity that Valmonde had never seen.

The first map he examined was a chart of the Mediterranean that was
more accurate than anything in European possession. The coastlines
corresponded to reality with an exactitude that implied astronomical
methods of measurement that Europe would not develop for two more
centuries. The islands were correctly positioned. The depths of the
sea, indicated by a system of notations that Valmonde had to decipher,
were consistent with the actual bathymetry. It was a map drawn by
people who had access to instruments and methods that Valmonde did not
possess and could not imagine.

But the Mediterranean map was merely precise. The maps that followed
were something else entirely.

The second map showed the western coast of Africa, extending south far
beyond the limits of European knowledge. The coastline was rendered
with the same astonishing accuracy, and it continued -- around a
southern cape, then north and east along a coastline that Valmonde
could not identify. No European had sailed around Africa. The
Portuguese were decades away from attempting it. Yet here was a map
that depicted the entire circuit, complete with notations indicating
harbors, currents, and prevailing winds.

The third map showed a coastline that Valmonde could not place at all.
It lay to the west of Africa, across an expanse of ocean that European
cartographers filled with speculation and monsters. Two vast continental
masses, connected by a narrow isthmus, extending from the far north to
the far south. The coastlines were detailed. The interiors were marked
with mountain ranges, river systems, and notations in a script that
Valmonde could not read.

He stared at this map for a long time. Then he cross-referenced it
against the navigational charts that accompanied it, charts that
included latitude and longitude coordinates calculated by methods that
he did not understand, and he performed his own calculations, and he
arrived at a conclusion that made his hands tremble.

The map depicted a real place. A place across the western ocean. A
place that no European knew existed.

This, in itself, would have been the discovery of a lifetime. But
Valmonde was a thorough man, and he continued to read, and what he
found in the deeper stacks of the Alexandrian collection was stranger
by orders of magnitude.


                               IV.

The fourth map did not depict any place on Earth.

Valmonde arrived at this conclusion after weeks of analysis. The
coastlines did not correspond to any known geography. The planetary
dimensions implied by the latitude-longitude grid were different from
Earth's. The notations -- which he was slowly learning to decipher,
using a bilingual glossary that the Alexandrian librarians had helpfully
included -- referred to astronomical observations that did not match
Earth's sky. Different constellations. A different number of moons.
A sun that was described as "larger and more red" than the one
Valmonde saw each morning.

He sat in his workroom and stared at the map and felt the ground
beneath his assumptions shift.

The Alexandrian collection included, he realized as he read further,
a taxonomy of what the librarians called "parallel geographies." The
concept was articulated in a treatise that Valmonde found at the bottom
of the third crate, written in Greek, and attributed to a scholar
named Heraclides of Pontus, who had worked at the Library in the third
century BC. The treatise proposed, on philosophical and mathematical
grounds, that the universe consisted of an infinite number of parallel
worlds, each differing from the others in specific ways, and that
these worlds were not merely theoretical constructs but actual places
that could, under certain conditions, be accessed.

In your timeline, Heraclides of Pontus was a minor philosopher whose
works were mostly lost. In Valmonde's timeline, Heraclides was the
founder of a school of cosmological inquiry that had been pursuing his
ideas for sixteen hundred years, using the Library of Alexandria as its
institutional base. The school had developed, over the centuries, a
method for detecting the boundaries between parallel worlds -- a method
that involved astronomical observation, mathematical calculation, and
a practice that the treatise described, in language that Valmonde
found deeply unsettling, as "reading the world's edges."

The maps in the deeper stacks were maps of those other worlds.

And the Library -- the great Library of Alexandria, which in your
timeline burned and in Valmonde's timeline endured -- was not merely a
repository of knowledge. It was a door.


                               V.

(A note on the nature of what follows. I am a historian. I trade in
documented fact, sourced evidence, and defensible interpretation. What
Valmonde claimed to discover in the Library of Alexandria is, by the
standards of my discipline, indefensible. I include it because history
is, at its best, an honest accounting of what people believed and did,
even when -- especially when -- what they believed exceeds what we can
explain.

The reader may choose to regard Valmonde's account as allegory,
metaphor, or madness. I ask only that the choice be made after, rather
than before, the account has been read.)


                               VI.

The Royal Library in Paris in 1308 was a modest affair compared to the
Alexandrian original -- a few rooms in the palace, staffed by clerks
and scholars who were learned but provincial. The Alexandrian documents
overwhelmed its resources. Crates went unopened. Translations stalled.
The scholars, confronted with knowledge that exceeded their frameworks,
retreated into the familiar and left the unfamiliar in the stacks.

Valmonde did not retreat. Valmonde went deeper.

He taught himself the Alexandrian mathematical notation. He learned the
cosmological terminology. He traced the citations in Heraclides' treatise
back through the stacks to their sources, and the sources to their
sources, and he followed the chain of inquiry down into the deeper
levels of the collection, where the documents grew older and stranger
and the papyrus was so ancient that it crumbled at the edges when he
touched it.

At the deepest level, he found the atlases.

They were bound in leather that he could not identify -- not cow, not
goat, not sheep, not any animal he knew. The pages were not papyrus
but a material that resembled papyrus the way that a diamond resembles
glass: structurally similar, functionally transcendent. The maps inside
were drawn in an ink that shimmered faintly in the candlelight, as
though the ink itself possessed a light source.

Each atlas was labeled. The labels were in a script that Valmonde had,
by now, learned to read -- the Alexandrian cataloguing system, which
had been in continuous use for thirteen centuries and which assigned
each work a precise location in the Library's classification scheme.
The atlases were classified under a heading that translated, roughly,
as "Geographies of Adjacent Worlds."

Valmonde opened the first atlas.

The map inside showed a world that was almost Earth. The continental
shapes were recognizable -- Europe, Africa, Asia -- but altered. The
Mediterranean was wider. The British Isles were connected to the
continent by a land bridge. A large island sat in the mid-Atlantic
where no island existed in Valmonde's world. The map was annotated with
observations about the island's geology, climate, and inhabitants, and
the observations were dated, and the dates extended back to the third
century BC, and the observations described a civilization that built in
stone and sailed copper-hulled ships and had developed a mathematics
based on the number twelve.

The second atlas showed a world in which the Sahara was a sea. The
third showed a world in which the Indian subcontinent had broken away
from Asia and drifted south, forming a massive island in the southern
ocean. The fourth showed a world in which the ice caps extended to the
fortieth parallel and the habitable zone was a narrow band around the
equator.

Each atlas was accompanied by navigational charts -- not for sailing
from port to port, but for traveling from world to world. The charts
described the "edges" that Heraclides' treatise had mentioned: specific
locations where the boundary between parallel worlds was thin enough to
be crossed. These locations were, according to the charts, fixed in
space but variable in time, opening and closing according to
astronomical cycles that the Alexandrian scholars had mapped with
extraordinary precision.

And the primary location -- the edge that was most stable, most
accessible, most thoroughly documented -- was in the Library of
Alexandria itself.


                               VII.

The deepest stacks.

Valmonde stared at the atlases and understood what they implied. The
Library of Alexandria was not merely a repository. It was a junction.
A place where the boundaries between worlds converged, where the
"edges" that Heraclides had described were permanent rather than
cyclical. The Library had been built on this spot not by accident but
by design. The Ptolemaic kings who founded it -- in Valmonde's
timeline, advised by scholars who had inherited Heraclides' knowledge --
had chosen the location precisely because it was a crossing point.

The Library collected knowledge from many worlds. Not metaphorically.
Actually. The librarians sent expeditions through the edges, into the
adjacent worlds, and the expeditions brought back observations, maps,
texts, and artifacts, and these were catalogued and stored and
integrated into the Library's ever-growing collection.

The Library of Alexandria, in the timeline where it survived, had
become the greatest repository of knowledge not merely on Earth but
across multiple Earths. It was a library of worlds.

And the documents that had arrived in Paris -- the crates that now
filled Valmonde's workroom -- were copies of a fraction of this
collection. Copies that the Alexandrian librarians had sent to the
court of Philip IV, through the Caliph of Egypt, for reasons that
Valmonde was only now beginning to comprehend.

He found the letter at the bottom of the last crate. It was written
in Greek, in a hand that was elegant and precise, and it was addressed
not to the King of France but to "whoever among the Franks has the
wisdom to understand what they have been given."

The letter said:

"The edges are closing. We have observed the pattern for two thousand
years, and the pattern is clear. The junctions are narrowing. The
adjacent worlds are becoming inaccessible. Within three generations,
the crossing points will seal, and the worlds will be separate forever.

"We send these copies so that the knowledge will survive the closing.
So that even when the doors are shut, the maps of the other rooms
will remain.

"Use them wisely. Or do not use them at all. But do not destroy them.
What is destroyed in one world is destroyed in all worlds, and the
loss echoes across every Edge forever."


                               VIII.

Valmonde spent the winter of 1308-1309 in a state of sustained
intellectual crisis.

He was a cartographer. His profession was the accurate representation
of the known world. And now he held in his hands maps of unknown worlds
-- worlds that were real, adjacent, and soon to be permanently
inaccessible. He held the knowledge that the universe was not a single
room but a house with many rooms, and that the doors between the rooms
were closing, and that the maps of those rooms were the last record of
their existence.

He could do several things with this knowledge. He could present it to
the King, who would not understand it. He could present it to the
Church, which would condemn it. He could present it to the scholars of
the Sorbonne, who would debate it for decades and arrive at no
conclusion. He could publish it, and be called a madman. He could
suppress it, and be complicit in the loss.

Or he could go to Alexandria.

The idea was absurd. The journey from Paris to Alexandria was two
thousand miles over hostile and uncertain territory. The Crusades had
ended. The Holy Land was in Muslim hands. The relationship between
Christendom and the Caliphate was one of mutual suspicion punctuated
by occasional commerce. A French cartographer traveling to Egypt to
visit a library would be regarded, by every authority along the route,
as either a spy or a lunatic.

Valmonde went anyway.

He left Paris in March of 1309, traveling as a merchant -- a plausible
cover, since the trade in maps and navigational instruments was
lucrative and international. He crossed the Mediterranean on a Venetian
galley. He reached Alexandria in June.

The Library was there. Of course it was there. It had been there for
sixteen hundred years. It occupied a complex of buildings near the
harbor -- the original Ptolemaic structure expanded and rebuilt many
times, now a vast campus of colonnaded halls, archives, reading rooms,
scriptoria, and the residential quarters where scholars from across
the known world (and, Valmonde now understood, beyond it) lived and
worked.

He presented himself as a scholar and was admitted. The Alexandrian
librarians were, by long tradition, hospitable to visiting scholars
regardless of origin or religion. They assigned him a reading room.
They gave him access to the catalogues.

He asked about the deepest stacks.

The librarian who received his request was an old man with sharp eyes
and a stillness about him that reminded Valmonde of deep water.

"You have read the materials we sent to your king," the librarian said.
It was not a question.

"I have."

"You understand what they describe."

"I believe I do."

"And you wish to see the edges."

Valmonde was quiet for a moment. "I wish to see the truth."

The old librarian studied him with an expression that contained, Valmonde
thought, both compassion and warning.

"The truth," the librarian said, "is that the edges exist, and that
they are closing, and that we have spent two thousand years exploring
the adjacent worlds and cataloguing what we found, and that the
catalogue is the most comprehensive record of reality ever assembled,
and that within a generation, the record will be all that remains."

He paused.

"The truth is also this: that every expedition we have sent through
the edges has returned with knowledge, and that every piece of
knowledge, once possessed, has been used. Not always wisely. Not always
well. The adjacent worlds are not abstractions, Cartographer. They are
places where people live. Our expeditions have changed those places,
sometimes for the better, sometimes not. Knowledge is not innocent. The
act of mapping a place is the first step toward claiming it."

"I am a cartographer," Valmonde said. "I know this."

"Do you? Then you know that the maps you saw in Paris -- the maps of
the western continents, the maps of the adjacent Earths -- have already
done their work. The knowledge that those continents exist, whether
in this world or an adjacent one, has entered the mind of a
cartographer of the court of France. And the court of France will act
on that knowledge. Not immediately. Not directly. But the seed is
planted. The western continents will be sought. They will be found.
They will be claimed."

The librarian's eyes were very old.

"We have seen this pattern before. In other timelines. In other
branches of the divergence. The Library sends knowledge out into the
world, and the world uses it, and the use is not always kind. We have
debated this for centuries. Whether the preservation of knowledge
justifies the consequences of its dissemination. We have not resolved
the debate. We do not expect to."

"Then why do you send the copies?"

"Because the alternative is to hoard the knowledge, and hoarded
knowledge dies when the hoarder dies. The edges are closing. When
they close, this Library -- this junction, this crossing point -- will
become an ordinary building full of extraordinary documents. The
documents will survive only if copies exist elsewhere. And copies can
only exist elsewhere if we send them out, knowing that they will be
used, knowing that the use may cause harm, knowing that the
preservation of knowledge and the prevention of harm are goals that
cannot both be fully achieved."

He rose.

"Come. I will show you the deepest stacks."


                               IX.

The deepest stacks were underground.

They descended through corridors carved from the living rock beneath
the Library, the walls lined with shelves that held documents in
containers of every material Valmonde could identify and several he
could not. The air was cool and dry and carried a faint charge, a
prickling on the skin that intensified as they descended.

The librarian led. Valmonde followed. The corridors branched and
branched again, and Valmonde realized that the underground portion
of the Library was larger than the surface buildings, extending in
every direction, a labyrinth of knowledge that mirrored the labyrinth
of worlds it described.

At the lowest level, the corridors opened into a chamber.

The chamber was circular, perhaps fifty meters in diameter, with a
domed ceiling that was covered in a mosaic depicting the night sky --
not the night sky as seen from Alexandria, Valmonde realized after a
moment's study, but the night sky as seen from multiple locations,
multiple worlds, superimposed in layers that created a composite image
of dizzying complexity.

In the center of the chamber was the edge.

It did not look like much. A shimmer in the air. A place where the
quality of the light changed -- where it became thinner, or thicker,
or acquired a quality that language could not capture because language
had been developed in a single world and the edge existed between
worlds. Valmonde stared at it and felt his mind refuse and then accept
and then refuse again, cycling between recognition and incomprehension.

"This is the primary junction," the librarian said. "It has been
open since before the Library was built. It is the reason the Library
was built. For two thousand years, our scholars have stepped through
this edge into adjacent worlds, explored them, mapped them, and
returned. They have walked on continents that do not exist in this
timeline. They have seen civilizations that arose from different
divergence points. They have documented the breadth of possibility."

He paused.

"And the edge is closing. You can see it, if you look carefully. It
was wider when I was young. It is narrower now. In twenty years,
perhaps thirty, it will close entirely. And the adjacent worlds will
become what they are in every timeline where the Library burned:
theoretical. Abstract. Lost."

Valmonde looked at the edge. He looked at the shimmer in the air that
was all that remained of a door between worlds.

"May I--"

"No. Not safely. The narrowing makes transit unpredictable. You might
arrive in an adjacent world. You might arrive in the space between
worlds, which is not a space at all. We have lost three scholars in
the last decade to failed transits. The risk is no longer acceptable."

Valmonde stood in the chamber beneath the Library of Alexandria and
looked at the edge -- the closing door, the narrowing gap between
worlds -- and felt, for the first time in his life, the full weight
of loss that comes with the knowledge of what exists and the
inability to reach it.

The maps he had studied in Paris. The atlases of adjacent Earths. The
continents that did not exist in his world but existed in others. The
civilizations, the geographies, the possibilities. All of it was real.
All of it was there, on the other side of a shimmer in the air that
was growing thinner by the year.

"This is why you sent the copies," he said.

"Yes. The maps will outlast the edges. The knowledge of the adjacent
worlds will survive as documents, as records, as the testimony of
scholars who walked there and wrote down what they saw. It will
survive the way all knowledge survives when the primary source is
lost: imperfectly. Incompletely. As a map survives the territory it
describes."

The librarian looked at Valmonde with eyes that held two thousand years
of accumulated grief.

"You are a cartographer, Etienne Valmonde. You know that a map is not
the territory. But you also know that when the territory is gone, the
map is all that remains. And the map, however imperfect, is better
than nothing."


                               X.

Valmonde returned to Paris in the autumn of 1309. He carried with him
copies of the atlases -- the atlases of adjacent Earths, the
navigational charts of the edges, the treatise of Heraclides, the
letter from the librarians. He carried them in a chest that he guarded
with his life across two thousand miles of road and sea.

He presented the materials to the Royal Library. The scholars examined
them. They were impressed by the maps of the Mediterranean and the
African coast, which they recognized as superior to anything in
European possession. They filed the rest -- the atlases of adjacent
worlds, the treatises on the edges, the navigational charts of reality
-- as curiosities, works of speculative philosophy, the fantasies of
Eastern scholars with too much time and too much imagination.

Valmonde protested. He was ignored. He protested more forcefully. He
was patronized. He protested with the intensity of a man who had seen
the edge with his own eyes and who knew that the documents he was
holding were not fantasies but records, not speculation but testimony,
not imagination but cartography of the most literal kind.

He was, eventually, dismissed from his position. A cartographer who
insisted that he had seen a door between worlds was not a cartographer
who could be trusted to map the provinces of France.

He spent the remaining years of his life in a small house in Chartres,
where he compiled his account of the Alexandrian collection and the
edge he had seen in the chamber beneath the Library. He titled the
account "Phantom Continents: A Record of the Adjacent Worlds and the
Closing of the Edges." He completed it in 1314. He died in 1316.

The manuscript was placed in the archives of the cathedral at Chartres,
where it remained, unread, for six hundred and fifty years.


                               XI.

I found it in 1960.

I was in Chartres on sabbatical, researching the medieval cartographic
tradition, and the cathedral archivist, learning of my interest,
mentioned a curious document that had been in the collection since the
fourteenth century. I examined it expecting a minor curiosity. What I
found was Valmonde's account.

I have spent the last four years studying it. I have verified, to the
extent that verification is possible, the historical details of
Valmonde's biography, his commission from the Royal Library, and his
journey to Alexandria. The maps he describes -- the ones that were filed
and preserved by the Royal Library -- are extant and are indeed
superior to any European cartography of the period. The atlases of
adjacent worlds, if they were ever in the Royal Library's possession,
are not there now. They have been lost, or destroyed, or filed in some
uncatalogued corner where they await discovery by a scholar more
persistent or more fortunate than I.

I have also traveled to Alexandria. The Library -- the physical Library,
the buildings that Valmonde described -- is gone. It was destroyed in
the fifteenth century, not by fire but by neglect, the Ottoman
administration having deemed its maintenance too costly for a
provincial city of declining importance. The underground chambers, if
they existed, are buried beneath the modern city.

The edges, if they existed, are closed.

I am a historian. I deal in evidence and interpretation. I cannot prove
that Valmonde's account is true. I cannot prove that the Library of
Alexandria, in a timeline where it survived, became a junction between
parallel worlds. I cannot prove that maps of adjacent Earths existed,
that scholars walked between worlds, that the edges were real.

But I can prove that Valmonde believed it. I can prove that his account
is internally consistent, rigorously detailed, and free of the
hallmarks of fabrication that a historian learns to identify. I can
prove that the maps he brought back from Alexandria were real and were
centuries ahead of European knowledge. And I can note that the western
continents he described -- the two great landmasses connected by an
isthmus, lying across the ocean from Africa -- were discovered by
European navigators less than two centuries after Valmonde returned
from Alexandria with maps of places that, he was told, might exist
in this world or in an adjacent one.

The reader may draw conclusions. The historian presents the evidence
and withdraws.

But I will add one thing, not as a historian but as a man who has stood
in the ruins of the Library of Alexandria and felt the air shimmer --
just for a moment, just at the edge of perception, in a way that might
have been heat-haze or might have been something else.

The loss is real. Whatever the edges were, whatever the adjacent worlds
contained, whatever knowledge the Library accumulated across two
thousand years and multiple realities -- it is gone. The edges are
closed. The doors are shut. The maps are lost. And we are left in a
single room of a house that once had many rooms, and we can only guess
at what the other rooms contained.

This is the condition of knowledge. We know what we have found. We
mourn what we have lost. And we draw maps of the territory that
remains, knowing that the territory is always larger than the map,
and that the map, however incomplete, is all we have.

Phantom continents. Adjacent worlds. The Library that survived.

The wind that shifted, or did not shift.

The fire that burned, or did not burn.

The door that closed.

                             NIGHTWATCH

                         by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The ship had no name.

It had possessed one, once. The original manifest, stored in the deep
archive where no one looked anymore, recorded the vessel as the
Stjarnseglaren -- the Star Sailor -- registered out of the European
Orbital Authority in the year 2311. But names require someone to speak
them, and for the better part of two centuries no one aboard had spoken
the ship's name or thought to ask what it was. They called it the ship.
Some of the older residents called it home, though the word carried no
warmth when they said it.

Maren Lindh was twenty-three years old and had never seen a horizon.

She had seen images of horizons, of course. The archive contained
photographs from Earth -- the world of origin, the world of departure,
the world that existed now only as a concept taught to children who
could not grasp it and did not try. The photographs showed landscapes
of bewildering openness: plains, oceans, deserts, skies that went on
and on without termination. Maren had looked at these images as a
child and felt nothing. They were pictures of an impossible place. A
place where the walls ended and the air kept going.

She lived on Deck Seven, Section Fourteen, in a compartment that
measured four meters by three meters by two and a half meters. She knew
its dimensions exactly because she had measured them once, for no
reason she could articulate, using a maintenance tape from the tool
locker. The act of measuring had felt important, though she could not
have said why. She had written the numbers on a piece of recycled
paper and pinned it to her wall, where it remained -- the only
decoration in the compartment. The only decoration in any compartment
on Deck Seven.

Her work was air filtration. She monitored the scrubbers in Section
Fourteen, replaced their filters on the prescribed schedule, logged
the replacement in the maintenance system, and moved to the next
scrubber. There were forty-seven scrubbers in her section. A full
cycle took eleven days. On the twelfth day she began again.

This was life aboard the ship: the performance of necessary tasks in
their necessary sequence, repeated until the sequence renewed itself,
the way a clock hand sweeps around its face and arrives where it
began, and sweeps again.

Maren did not question this. No one did. Questioning required a sense
that things could be otherwise, and that sense had been absent from
the ship for longer than anyone could remember.


                               II.

The ship was four hundred and twelve years into a voyage of one
thousand and six years.

The original passengers -- three thousand colonists selected by the
European Authority through a process of genetic screening,
psychological evaluation, and political compromise -- had known where
they were going. They had studied the destination star, Kepler-442,
and the habitable world that orbited it. They had memorized its
atmospheric composition, its gravity, its seasonal cycles. They had
trained for the world they would never reach, understanding that the
training was not for them but for their descendants, who would inherit
both the knowledge and the obligation.

Those first-generation colonists had been, by all accounts, remarkable
people. The archive recorded their names, their specializations, their
personal statements. Some had written at length about their reasons
for volunteering -- the idealism, the adventure, the desire to
participate in something larger than a single lifetime. Their words,
when Maren encountered them in her occasional and desultory browsing
of the archive, seemed to come from an alien species. Not because the
language was different, but because the emotional register was
unrecognizable. These people had felt things that Maren could not
name.

The second generation had inherited the mission and, to a diminished
but still functional degree, the purpose. They taught their children
the destination protocols. They maintained the educational programs.
They celebrated Departure Day and Arrival Eve, holidays that marked
the beginning and projected end of the voyage.

The third generation maintained the forms but began to lose the
feeling. The fourth generation lost the forms as well.

By the eighth generation -- Maren's generation -- the voyage was a
fact of existence as unremarkable as gravity. They were on a ship.
The ship was going somewhere. The going would continue for a span of
time so vast that it defeated comprehension. In the meantime, the
scrubbers needed their filters changed and the hydroponic bays needed
their nutrient cycles monitored and the hull sensors needed their
calibration checks, and the doing of these things constituted a life.

Not a good life. Not a bad life. A life.

The population had stabilized at approximately twenty-two hundred. Not
through any policy -- the population management protocols established
by the first generation had lapsed in the fifth -- but through a kind
of demographic equilibrium that the ship's systems had settled into
the way water settles into a basin. People were born, people lived,
people died, and the number remained roughly the same, oscillating
within a narrow band that no one tracked because no one cared to know.


                               III.

The sound began on a Tuesday.

Or what the ship's chronometer designated as Tuesday. The days of the
week had survived the centuries unchanged -- an inheritance so deeply
embedded in the operating system that no one had thought to question
it, and which persisted like a fossil in digital amber, carrying the
memory of a world that had organized its time around the rotation of
a planet that was now unimaginably far away.

Maren was replacing the filter in Scrubber 14-27 when she heard it.
Not heard, precisely. Felt. A vibration in the air that was different
from the vibrations she knew -- the steady hum of the life support
systems, the periodic clank of the thermal regulators cycling, the
distant throb of the engines that she had been told was the engines
but that she suspected was simply the pulse of the ship itself, its
mechanical heartbeat.

This was different. It rose and fell. It had -- she searched for a
word and could not find one. It had shape.

She set down the filter cartridge and stood still, her head tilted,
listening. The sound lasted perhaps ten seconds. Then it stopped.

She waited. The ship hummed its familiar hum. The thermal regulators
clanked. The engines throbbed. The sound did not return.

Maren picked up the filter cartridge and completed the replacement.
She logged it in the maintenance system. She moved to Scrubber 14-28.

But she thought about the sound for the rest of the day, and when she
lay in her compartment that night, staring at the ceiling that was
one hundred and eighteen centimeters from her face, she tried to
reproduce it. She opened her mouth and let air pass over her vocal
cords, shaping it with her lips and tongue, trying to find the
contour of what she had heard.

What emerged was a rough, tuneless exhalation. Nothing like the sound.
But the act of trying -- the act of shaping air into something that
was not speech and not silence but something in between -- produced a
sensation she had never experienced before. A tension in her chest
that was not painful. A prickling behind her eyes that was not tears.

She did not know what to call it. She had no vocabulary for it. The
ship's language, pared down over centuries to the functional minimum
required for the coordination of tasks, did not contain the words she
needed.

She lay in the dark and breathed and did not sleep for a long time.


                               IV.

The sound came again three days later. This time Maren was in the
corridor outside the communal eating hall, and the sound was louder,
or she was closer to its source. It lasted longer -- perhaps thirty
seconds -- and she was able to discern more of its structure. It
rose in a series of steps, paused, descended by a different path,
paused again, and then rose once more to a point higher than before.
There was repetition in it, but not exact repetition. Each return
was a variation. Each ascent found a slightly different route.

She stood in the corridor and let the sound pass through her and
felt the tension in her chest again, stronger now, and something
else -- a sensation of spaciousness, as though the corridor had
expanded, as though the walls had drawn back and revealed a volume
of air she had not known was there.

The sound stopped. The walls returned to their normal positions. The
corridor was four meters wide, as it had always been.

Maren walked toward the source.

She found it on Deck Six, in one of the abandoned storage bays that
had been emptied generations ago when the supplies they contained
were consumed and not replaced. The bay was large -- ten meters by
twelve, with a high ceiling designed to accommodate stacked cargo
containers. It was empty now except for dust and the residual smell
of plastics that had long since been recycled.

In the center of the bay, a girl sat on the floor.

She was young -- sixteen, perhaps seventeen. She sat cross-legged with
her back straight and her eyes closed, and she was making the sound
with her mouth. Not with words. With sustained tones that she shaped
and shifted and layered one upon another in a way that should not
have been possible from a single throat but somehow was, the
resonance of the empty bay lending the tones a depth and complexity
that amplified them beyond their origin.

Maren stood in the doorway and did not move.

The girl's name, she would learn later, was Solveig. Solveig Dahl.
She was seventeen years old and she worked in the hydroponic bays on
Deck Five, tending the nutrient cycles that kept the food crops
alive. She had no particular distinction. She had no particular
history. She was, in every measurable respect, an ordinary inhabitant
of the ship.

Except that she was doing something that no one on the ship had done
in living memory. She was doing something that had no function, served
no system, maintained no process. She was producing sound for the
sake of the sound itself, and the sound was -- Maren searched again
for the word and again failed to find it, but the word that came
closest, the word that the deep archive might have offered if she had
known to look, was beautiful.


                               V.

Maren did not speak to Solveig that first time. She listened from the
doorway until the sound ceased, and then she withdrew before the girl
opened her eyes. She returned to her section and replaced three more
filters and ate her evening meal in the communal hall and lay in her
compartment and stared at the ceiling and tried again to reproduce
what she had heard.

This time, something shifted. A tone emerged from her throat that had
a quality she recognized -- not the same as Solveig's sound, but
adjacent to it, the way two corridors on the same deck might run
parallel without meeting. She held the tone and felt it vibrate in
her sternum, in her sinuses, in the bones of her skull. She let it
change. She let it rise.

The compartment was too small. The sound hit the walls and came back
flattened, compressed, stripped of the spaciousness she had felt in
the storage bay. She stopped.

But she had done it. She had made something. Not a word. Not a
report. Not a maintenance log entry. Something.

The next day she went back to the storage bay on Deck Six. Solveig
was there again, sitting in the same position, her eyes closed, her
sounds filling the empty space like water filling a container -- not
all at once but gradually, finding every corner, every recess, every
pocket of air.

This time, Maren entered the bay. She walked to within three meters
of Solveig and sat down on the floor, cross-legged, mirroring the
girl's posture. She closed her eyes.

Solveig's sound washed over her. Maren listened for a long time --
ten minutes, twenty, she lost track -- and then she opened her mouth
and added her own tone.

It was rough. It was uncertain. It wavered and cracked and did not
know where to go. But it existed, and it occupied the same air as
Solveig's sound, and for a moment -- just a moment -- the two sounds
found each other. They aligned. They produced something that was
neither Solveig's creation nor Maren's but a third thing that belonged
to both of them and to neither, a thing that existed only in the space
between.

Solveig opened her eyes. She looked at Maren. Her expression was one
that Maren had never seen on another human face -- not surprise, not
pleasure, not recognition, but something that contained elements of
all three and transcended them. A fullness. An arrival.

They did not speak. They did not need to. The sound had said what
needed to be said.


                               VI.

Within a week, three more people came.

Maren did not recruit them. Solveig did not recruit them. The sound
recruited them. It traveled through the ventilation ducts and along
the corridors and through the thin walls that separated compartment
from compartment, and the people who heard it and felt the tension in
their chests and the prickling behind their eyes followed it to its
source, the way -- Maren thought, though she did not have the
reference to complete the thought -- the way water follows gravity.
The way roots follow moisture. The way something alive moves toward
what it needs.

The three who came were: Peder, a hull maintenance technician, age
forty-one, a silent man with large hands who sat in the corner of the
bay and listened for three days before he produced his first sound, a
deep bass note that vibrated the floor; Astrid, a food distribution
coordinator, age twenty-nine, who arrived crying and could not explain
why and who, when she finally opened her mouth, produced a sound so
high and clear that it seemed to come from somewhere above the ceiling;
and Old Rolf, whose actual name was Rolf Magnusson and who was
sixty-eight years old and the oldest person anyone in Section Fourteen
knew, a retired water recycling specialist who walked with a cane and
who sat against the wall and did not make sounds but listened with his
eyes closed and an expression on his face that none of them had seen
before -- an expression that, if any of them had possessed the word,
they might have called peace.

They came in the evenings, after their work shifts ended, and they
sat in the storage bay and made sounds together. They had no theory
of what they were doing. They had no tradition to draw from, no
instruction manuals, no teachers. The archive contained records of
something called music -- the word surfaced in texts from the early
generations -- but none of them had accessed those records and none
of them connected what they were doing to a historical practice. They
were inventing it. They were discovering it the way the first humans
who had ever sung had discovered it: through the body, through the
breath, through the vibration of air against membrane, through the
mysterious capacity of organized sound to produce emotional states
that unorganized sound could not.

And the emotional states were the revolution.

For the first time in memory, the people in that storage bay were
feeling things they could not name. The tension in the chest. The
prickling behind the eyes. The sense of spaciousness. The fullness.
The arrival. These sensations had no function. They maintained no
system. They contributed nothing to the continued operation of the
ship. And yet they were -- the word came to Maren one night as she
lay in her compartment, and when it came, it came with the force of
a discovery, a revelation, a door opening onto a room she had not
known existed -- they were necessary.

Not necessary the way air filtration was necessary, or food
production, or hull integrity. Necessary the way -- she struggled
again with the limits of her vocabulary and found that the limits
were themselves the problem, that the language she had inherited was
a tool designed for maintenance and coordination and was no more
capable of expressing what she felt than a wrench was capable of
writing a poem.

She needed new words. Or she needed the old words back.


                               VII.

The trouble began, as trouble often does, with a report.

Henrik Voss was the Section Fourteen coordinator, a man of fifty
whose authority derived not from any formal election or appointment
but from the fact that he had coordinated the section's maintenance
schedules for twenty years and no one had objected. He was competent,
colorless, and deeply invested in the smooth continuation of routines
that had not changed in his lifetime and that he saw no reason to
change in anyone else's.

The report came from a sensor monitoring station on Deck Six. The
storage bay's atmospheric readings were anomalous. Carbon dioxide
levels elevated. Temperature slightly above baseline. Occupancy
indicators showing five to seven persons present in a space designated
as unoccupied.

Henrik investigated. He stood in the doorway of the storage bay on a
Thursday evening and observed five people sitting on the floor with
their eyes closed, producing sounds.

He watched for four minutes. His face showed nothing. Then he turned
and left.

The next morning, Maren received a message on her work terminal:
"Report to Section Coordinator. 0800."

She went. Henrik sat behind his desk -- a desk identical to every
other desk on the ship, extruded from the same polymer, in the same
configuration, indistinguishable -- and looked at her with an
expression she could not read.

"What is happening in Storage Bay 6-14?" he asked.

Maren considered the question. She did not have an answer that would
make sense in the language available to her. She did not have a word
for what they were doing. She had not yet discovered the word music
in the archive, and even if she had, the word would have meant nothing
to Henrik.

"We make sounds," she said.

Henrik waited for elaboration. None came.

"For what purpose?" he asked.

This was the question that Maren could not answer, because the concept
of purpose on the ship was synonymous with function, and function was
synonymous with the maintenance of systems. Everything that happened
on the ship happened because it kept the ship running. Air filtration
had a purpose. Food production had a purpose. Hull maintenance had a
purpose. What was the purpose of organized sound?

"There is no purpose," Maren said, and knew immediately that this was
both the truest thing she had ever said and the most dangerous.

Henrik's expression did not change. "Activities without purpose
consume resources," he said. "Air, heat, light, the physical energy
of the participants. Resources are finite. Allocation must be
justified."

"Yes," Maren said.

"Can you justify the allocation?"

"No," Maren said.

Henrik nodded. "Then it must stop."

Maren left his office and went to Scrubber 14-31 and replaced its
filter and logged the replacement and moved to Scrubber 14-32, and
while she worked, she felt something she had never felt before -- a
resistance. A refusal. Not dramatic, not heroic, not the stuff of
the stories that the first generation had carried with them from
Earth and that had been forgotten along with everything else that was
not functional. A quiet refusal. A weight in her chest that said: No.


                               VIII.

She went to the storage bay that evening. They all did. No one had
told the others about Henrik's order, but they came anyway, drawn
by the same gravity that had brought them the first time.

Solveig was already there, already singing -- for that was the word
Maren had finally found in the archive, buried in a cultural history
database that had not been accessed in one hundred and sixty years.
Singing. The production of musical tones by the human voice. Related
entries: song, melody, harmony, choir, concert, lullaby, hymn, dirge.
Each word a door opening onto a room that opened onto another room
that opened onto a vast architecture of human experience that had
been sealed and forgotten and was now, sound by sound, tone by tone,
being unsealed.

Maren sat and added her voice. Peder added his. Astrid added hers.
Old Rolf sat against the wall and listened and wept, which was
another thing that had not happened on the ship in a very long time.

The next morning, Maren received another message: "Report to Section
Coordinator. 0800."

She went. Henrik's face was the same.

"The activity in Storage Bay 6-14 has continued," he said.

"Yes," Maren said.

"I instructed that it stop."

"Yes."

"And yet it has continued."

"Yes."

Henrik was silent for a long time. In the silence, Maren heard the
hum of the ship, the clank of the thermal regulators, the throb of
the engines. The sounds of function. The sounds of a machine
performing its intended operations.

"I do not understand," Henrik said, and Maren realized that this
admission cost him something. That it was, in its way, a kind of
courage. Henrik was a man who understood the ship, and the ship was
all he had ever been asked to understand, and now something was
happening on the ship that the ship's logic could not account for.

"I do not understand either," Maren said. "But it is necessary."

"You said it had no purpose."

"It has no purpose. It is necessary."

Henrik looked at her as though she had spoken in a language he did
not know. Which, in a sense, she had.

"You may continue," he said, quietly, "until I receive further
instruction."

Maren did not ask from whom further instruction might come. There was
no one above Henrik except other section coordinators, and above them,
no one at all. The ship had no captain. The captaincy had lapsed in
the sixth generation when the last person who wanted the role died
and no one volunteered to replace them. The ship ran itself, maintained
by its inhabitants the way a body is maintained by its cells -- each
performing its function, none directing the whole.


                               IX.

The sound spread.

Not quickly. The ship was large and its inhabitants were not, by
temperament or habit, curious. But sound travels, and this sound
traveled with a persistence that mere air vibration could not account
for. People heard it and were changed by hearing it -- not
dramatically, not instantly, but in the slow, accumulating way that
water changes stone.

A woman on Deck Eight, a sanitation system monitor named Elin, heard
the sound through a ventilation duct while she was performing a
routine inspection. She stopped. She pressed her ear against the
duct wall. She listened for twenty minutes. She told no one, but
that night she lay in her compartment and hummed -- a single note,
sustained, trembling, fragile as a thread of spider silk stretched
across a corridor -- and the note made her feel something, and the
feeling made her cry, and the crying frightened her, and the fear
made her want to hum again.

A man on Deck Four, a nutrient chemist named Lars, heard a distorted
version of the sound transmitted through the ship's structural members
-- a ghost of a ghost of a melody, reduced by transmission to a
rhythm more than a tone. He began tapping the rhythm on his workbench.
He tapped it while he measured nutrient concentrations. He tapped it
while he calibrated pH sensors. He tapped it without knowing he was
tapping it, the way the heart beats without being told.

A child on Deck Nine, a girl of six named Britt, heard her mother
humming and asked what the sound was. The mother -- who had heard
it from a colleague who had heard it from someone who had visited
Deck Six -- did not know what to call it. She called it "the
Deck Six thing." Britt asked to hear more. The mother hummed again.
Britt hummed with her. The mother felt something and stopped. Britt
did not stop.

Within a month, the sound had reached every deck. Not as a unified
phenomenon -- there was no broadcasting system, no organized effort
to spread it -- but as a contagion, leaping from person to person
through the ancient and irrepressible human mechanisms of imitation
and emotional resonance. People hummed in corridors. People tapped
rhythms on work surfaces. People gathered in small groups in their
compartments and made sounds together, tentatively, clumsily, not
knowing what they were doing or why they were doing it but unable
to stop.

And with the sound came the feelings. And with the feelings came the
questions.


                               X.

The questions were dangerous.

Not because anyone forbade them -- there was no authority on the ship
with the power or the inclination to forbid questions. But because
the ship's culture had, over centuries, evolved to make questioning
unnecessary. If life consisted of the maintenance of systems, and
the systems functioned as they were designed to function, what was
there to question? One did not ask a scrubber why it scrubbed. One
did not ask a filter why it filtered. One performed one's function
and moved to the next function and the next, and the sequence was
the answer to every question that could be asked.

But the feelings that the sound produced were not part of any sequence.
They did not fit into the maintenance schedule. They could not be
logged or calibrated or replaced on a prescribed cycle. They existed
outside the system, and their existence implied that the system was
not everything. That there was a space outside the system. That the
space was vast. That the system, which had seemed to fill the entire
world, was in fact a small thing inside a larger thing, the way the
ship itself was a small thing inside the vastness of interstellar
space.

And once you sensed the space outside the system, you began to wonder
what else it contained.

Maren found herself, in the weeks that followed, returning to the
archive. Not the maintenance archive, which contained the technical
specifications she consulted daily, but the cultural archive -- the
deep storage where the first generation had deposited everything they
thought their descendants might need. Literature. History. Art.
Philosophy. Music -- recordings of it, thousands of hours, stored in
formats that the ship's systems could still decode.

She listened to the first recording on a Wednesday evening, alone
in her compartment, through a set of audio transducers she had
requisitioned from the maintenance supply as "replacement components
for atmospheric monitoring equipment," which was not precisely a lie
but was not precisely the truth either.

The recording was of a single human voice, unaccompanied, singing
in a language she did not understand. The archive metadata identified
it as "Kulning, traditional Swedish herding call, recorded 2089,
Dalarna province."

The voice was a woman's voice, high and clear and piercingly lonely,
rising into registers that seemed to exceed the capacity of the human
throat, calling out across distances that Maren's mind translated into
the distances she knew -- the length of a corridor, the span of a
deck, the depth of the ship from hull to hull. But the distances the
voice was calling across were not corridors or decks. They were
mountains and valleys and open sky, and the voice was calling to
animals that Maren had never seen, across a landscape she could not
imagine, in a country that was part of a world that was so far away
that the light that had left it when the ship departed had not yet
arrived at the destination the ship was heading toward.

Maren listened, and the tears came, and she did not stop them, and
when the recording ended, she played it again. And again. And again.
Until the voice became part of her, the way the hum of the ship was
part of her, the way the rhythm of the scrubber cycle was part of
her -- but different. Alive in a way that the ship's sounds were not
alive. Calling to something in her that had been waiting, in the
dark, for four hundred years.


                               XI.

The gathering in Storage Bay 6-14 grew. Ten people. Twenty. Thirty.
They came from different decks, different sections, different shifts.
They sat on the floor of the empty bay and they sang. Some had
listened to the archive recordings and brought fragments of melody
back with them, half-remembered, half-invented, imperfectly
transmitted the way all culture is imperfectly transmitted, changed
in the carrying. Others invented their own sounds, drew them from
their own bodies, discovered what their voices could do through
experiment and accident and the strange, unaccountable promptings of
whatever it is in human beings that makes them want to sing.

The sounds they made were not, by any historical standard, accomplished.
They had no training, no tradition, no theory of harmony or rhythm or
form. They were beginners in the most absolute sense: people
encountering an entire dimension of human experience for the first
time, with no guide and no precedent.

And yet.

There were moments -- unpredictable, unrepeatable, lasting sometimes
only a few seconds -- when the sounds aligned. When the individual
voices found each other in the shared air of the storage bay and
produced something that was more than the sum of their parts.
Something that made the bay feel larger than its dimensions. Something
that made the ship feel smaller than the space it traveled through.
Something that connected the singer to the singer and the singer to
the sound and the sound to the silence and the silence to the vast,
cold, star-filled dark beyond the hull.

In those moments, Maren felt something she could only describe as
recognition. Not of a place she had been but of a place she was
meant for. Not memory but premonition. Not the past but the future.
Not Earth, which she had never known, but the destination -- the
world at the end of the voyage, the world her ancestors had chosen,
the world that was still six hundred years away but that existed,
in those moments of alignment, as a presence, a promise, a reason.

This was what the first generation had known and the intervening
generations had lost: that the voyage had a destination. That the
destination was real. That the work of maintenance was not an end in
itself but a means to an end, and the end was arrival, and arrival
meant a horizon, an open sky, air that went on and on without
termination, a world where the walls ended and the space began.

The sound gave them back the future.


                               XII.

Not everyone welcomed it.

Henrik Voss attended one session and left after six minutes, his face
unreadable. He did not issue further orders regarding the storage bay.
He did not attend again. But Maren noticed that he began humming in
his office -- a tuneless, rhythmless, barely audible hum that he
seemed unaware of, a sound that escaped him the way air escapes a
seal that has developed an imperceptible flaw.

Others were less quietly ambivalent. A hull technician named Soren
stood in the doorway of the storage bay one evening and watched the
singers with an expression that Maren recognized as fear. Not fear
of the singers. Fear of the feeling that the singing produced. Fear
of the space that the feeling opened up. Fear of the questions that
the space contained.

"This will break something," Soren said. He said it quietly, to no
one in particular, and then he left.

Maren thought about this. She thought he might be right. The ship's
culture -- the stripped-down, functional, maintenance-oriented way of
life that had evolved over centuries -- was not an accident. It was
an adaptation. A response to the impossible psychological challenge
of multi-generational travel: the fact that the voyage was too long
for any individual or generation to comprehend, and that the only
sustainable response was to stop trying to comprehend it and simply
do the work. The culture of maintenance was a survival mechanism.
It had kept the ship running for four hundred years. It had kept the
population stable, the systems functional, the social order calm.

And now the singing was disrupting it. Not violently. Not
destructively. But the way a seed disrupts soil: by cracking it open,
by pushing through it, by transforming it into something that can
sustain growth.

The question was whether growth was what the ship needed, or whether
it needed what it had always had: endurance.


                               XIII.

Old Rolf died on a Sunday.

He died in the storage bay, during the evening gathering, sitting
against the wall in his usual position with his eyes closed and his
cane across his lap. The singers sang and Rolf listened and at some
point during the session he stopped listening and started dying, and
the transition was so quiet that no one noticed until the singing
ended and Maren went to touch his shoulder and found him still.

He was sixty-eight years old. His heart had stopped. The cause of
death, when the medical system recorded it, was listed as cardiac
arrest, age-related, unremarkable. People died on the ship. Their
bodies were recycled. Their compartments were reassigned. Their names
were logged in the archive and forgotten.

But this death was not forgotten. This death was the first death that
the singers had experienced as singers, and they discovered that
singing changed the experience of death the way it changed the
experience of everything else. They sat with Rolf's body in the
storage bay and they sang -- not planned, not rehearsed, not
intentional in any way that could be articulated, but necessary,
deeply and undeniably necessary -- and the sound they produced was
different from any sound they had made before. It was lower. Slower.
It moved through the bay like something heavy and ancient, something
that had weight and substance, something that the walls and floor
and ceiling received and held.

A dirge. The word surfaced in Maren's mind from her archive
explorations. A song of mourning. A song sung for the dead.

They had reinvented grief. Or rather, they had rediscovered it. The
ship's inhabitants had been dying for centuries without grief, their
deaths processed with the same mechanical efficiency as a failed
component -- noted, logged, replaced. But grief was not the absence
of efficiency. Grief was the presence of value. To grieve was to
say: this life mattered. This person was not a component. This loss
is not a maintenance issue.

Old Rolf was recycled, as all the dead were recycled, his body
returned to the ship's biological systems to be reprocessed into
nutrients and raw materials. But before the recycling, the singers
carried him through the corridors of Deck Six, singing the dirge
they had invented, and the people who saw the procession stopped
and stared and some of them felt the tension in their chests and
the prickling behind their eyes, and some of them joined the
procession, and some of them turned away.

And after the recycling, Maren went to the archive and created a new
file. She titled it "Rolf Magnusson, Water Recycling Specialist,
Deck Seven, Section Fourteen." And in the file she wrote everything
she knew about him -- not his maintenance record, which the system
already contained, but him. His quietness. His cane. The way he sat
against the wall. The expression on his face when he listened. The
peace.

It was the first biography written on the ship in two hundred years.
It was also, though Maren did not know it, the first act of history.


                               XIV.

The months passed. The singing continued. The ship continued.

The storage bay gatherings became a fixture of life on the ship --
not universally attended, not universally approved, but present, the
way a new organ is present in a body that is learning to accommodate
it. Some people sang. Some people listened. Some people refused to do
either but found that they could not stop the sound from reaching
them through the walls and ducts and structural members of the ship,
and they lived with it the way they lived with the hum of the life
support systems: as a background condition of existence.

And things changed.

The changes were small. A maintenance technician on Deck Three began
painting. She used nutrient dyes from the hydroponic bays -- green,
amber, deep red -- and she painted on the walls of her compartment.
Geometric patterns at first, then curves, then shapes that were not
quite representational but not quite abstract, shapes that suggested
something without stating it. Other technicians on her corridor
stopped to look. Some asked her to paint their walls too.

A food distribution coordinator on Deck Eight began telling stories.
Not reading from the archive -- inventing them. Short, simple
narratives about people on the ship, fictional people in fictional
situations, but recognizable, the way a reflection in water is
recognizable even though it is not the thing itself. People gathered
to listen. They asked for more stories. They began telling their own.

A group of children on Deck Nine invented a game. It had no practical
purpose. It involved running and hiding and a complex set of rules
that the children revised daily and that bore no relationship to any
system maintenance protocol. The children laughed while they played.
The sound of children laughing traveled through the corridors and
the adults who heard it stopped what they were doing and felt
something -- something they could not name, something that was not
in the maintenance manual, something that had been absent from the
ship for so long that its return felt like a first arrival.

Maren watched these changes and understood them and feared them and
welcomed them and could not separate the fear from the welcome. The
ship was waking up. The ship's inhabitants were becoming, after
centuries of functional dormancy, human again -- not in the biological
sense, which they had never lost, but in the cultural sense, the
sense that encompassed art and story and play and grief and all the
other useless, essential things that human beings do when they are
not merely surviving but living.

And she knew that the waking would cost something. That consciousness
always costs something. That the price of feeling is the capacity
to feel pain, and the price of connection is the capacity for loss,
and the price of knowing where you are going is the knowledge of how
far you have yet to go.

Six hundred years. Six hundred years of voyage remaining. Six hundred
years of corridor and compartment and recycled air and the same
forty-seven scrubbers in the same sequence on the same eleven-day
cycle.

But now there was singing. Now there was painting and storytelling
and children laughing and the sound of a woman's voice rising in
an empty bay, calling across distances that were not corridors
or decks but something larger, something that had no walls, something
that went on and on.

Maren stood at the viewport on Deck Two -- the only viewport on
the ship, a small circle of reinforced glass that the first
generation had installed and that subsequent generations had ignored
because there was nothing to see. She looked out. The stars were
there, as they had always been. Faint, distant, innumerable. Among
them, indistinguishable from the rest, was the destination star. The
star they were traveling toward. The star that Maren's descendants,
six hundred years hence, would orbit and descend from and set foot
on the world of and build upon and plant in and die in.

She could not see it. She could not identify it. She would never
reach it.

But she knew it was there. And knowing was enough. Knowing was the
beginning of everything. Knowing was the first note of a song that
would take six hundred years to finish.

She stood at the viewport and looked at the stars and hummed.

The ship sailed on.

[THE END]

================================================================================

                       NOBODY BELIEVES ANYTHING

                         by Franklin Hoyt

================================================================================

                               I.

The editor's name was Margaret Osei and she had been in the business
long enough to know when a story was true, the way a carpenter knows
when a joint is square: not by measuring but by feel, by the click
of alignment, by the absence of the tiny wrongnesses that accumulate
when something has been forced into a shape it doesn't want to hold.

The story on her desk was true. She knew it the way she knew her own
name.

The problem was that it didn't matter.

She sat in the offices of the Washington Herald-Examiner on a Tuesday
in March and read through the documents again. Three hundred and
twelve pages of internal correspondence from the Department of
Environmental Stewardship, obtained by a source she had cultivated
for two years. The correspondence detailed, in the flat bureaucratic
prose that Margaret had learned to read the way a radiologist reads
X-rays, a systematic campaign to suppress data regarding nitrate
contamination in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Not dramatic
contamination. Not a single catastrophic event. The slow, steady,
decade-long accumulation of agricultural runoff that was, according
to the Department's own scientists, approaching a tipping point
beyond which the bay's ecosystem would enter irreversible collapse.

The scientists used the word "irreversible" three times in the
correspondence. They used the word "catastrophic" twice. They used
the phrase "point of no return" once, in a memo from Dr. Helen
Vasquez, the Department's chief aquatic ecologist, to her supervisor,
Deputy Secretary Kenneth Marsh, dated fourteen months ago.

Deputy Secretary Marsh had responded to Dr. Vasquez's memo with a
one-paragraph reply instructing her to "recalibrate her models using
the revised baseline parameters" that his office had developed in
consultation with "stakeholder representatives." Margaret knew, from
other documents in the cache, that the stakeholder representatives
were lobbyists for the Mid-Atlantic Agricultural Cooperative, the
single largest source of nitrate runoff in the watershed.

The story was clear. The documentation was solid. The science was
unambiguous. The public interest was overwhelming. A major American
estuary -- the largest in the country, a body of water that
supported a multi-billion-dollar fishing industry and provided
drinking water to millions of people -- was being poisoned, and
the agency charged with protecting it was covering up the evidence
at the behest of the industry doing the poisoning.

Twenty years ago, Margaret thought, this would have brought down a
deputy secretary. Ten years ago, it would have led to congressional
hearings. Five years ago, it would have at least generated a news
cycle.

Now?

She looked at the documents and felt the familiar weight settle onto
her shoulders: the weight of knowing something that no one would
believe.


                               II.

The problem was not new, but it had metastasized.

Margaret Osei was fifty-one years old and had been a journalist for
twenty-eight of those years, beginning as a cops reporter for the
Baltimore Sun in 1984 and working her way through the Philadelphia
Inquirer, the Associated Press Washington bureau, and finally the
Herald-Examiner, where she had been the environmental beat reporter
for the last nine years. She had won two Pulitzer nominations. She
had broken stories that had led to criminal prosecutions, regulatory
reforms, and the resignation of a sitting senator. She was very
good at her job.

But her job had changed. Not the work itself -- the work of finding
sources, obtaining documents, verifying facts, building narratives
that could withstand legal scrutiny -- that was the same. What had
changed was the environment into which the work was released. The
atmosphere. The medium through which information traveled from
reporter to reader.

The medium had become opaque.

It had happened gradually, the way the nitrate contamination had
happened gradually, the way all the worst things happen: not in a
single dramatic event that could be pointed to and named and resisted,
but in a slow accretion of small damages that individually seemed
manageable and collectively proved fatal.

The first damage was the fragmentation. The three networks, the major
newspapers, the wire services -- the institutions that had once
constituted a shared informational commons, a space in which Americans
of different political persuasions at least agreed on the basic facts
of the world they inhabited -- had splintered into a thousand channels,
each serving a self-selected audience, each confirming the audience's
existing beliefs, each treating the other channels not as competitors
but as enemies.

The second damage was the acceleration. The news cycle, which had once
been measured in days, then hours, then minutes, had collapsed into a
continuous present in which every story competed with every other story
for a shrinking window of attention, and the stories that won the
competition were not the most important or the most true but the most
stimulating, the most outrage-inducing, the most compatible with the
emotional needs of the audience.

The third damage was the counterfeiting. The tools for fabricating
convincing false information -- doctored photographs, synthetic
video, algorithmically generated text -- had become so cheap and so
sophisticated that the distinction between authentic and counterfeit
was no longer a matter of technical analysis but of trust, and trust
was precisely what had been destroyed.

The fourth damage -- the deepest, the most irreversible -- was the
exhaustion. The American public, battered by decades of competing
claims and counterclaims, of scandals that led nowhere and revelations
that changed nothing, of promises broken and institutions corrupted
and trust betrayed, had arrived at a state of epistemic fatigue so
profound that it resembled, in its practical effects, a kind of
collective unconsciousness. Not ignorance -- Americans were more
informed than ever, in the sense that more information was available
to them through more channels than at any point in human history.
But information without trust is noise, and the noise had become so
loud that the signal could no longer be heard.

Nobody believed anything.

Not the government. Not the media. Not science. Not each other.

Margaret sat at her desk with three hundred and twelve pages of
verified documentation proving that the Chesapeake Bay was dying,
and she knew -- with the same bone-deep certainty with which she
knew the story was true -- that it would not matter.


                               III.

She published anyway. That was the job.

The story ran on a Sunday, above the fold, under the headline
"CHESAPEAKE IN CRISIS: EPA SUPPRESSED DECADE OF CONTAMINATION DATA."
It was accompanied by a selection of the most damning documents,
redacted to protect the source, and by a sidebar in which Dr. Vasquez
-- who had agreed to speak on the record after months of negotiation,
at considerable risk to her career -- explained the science in terms
that a general reader could understand.

"We are looking at the functional death of the Chesapeake Bay within
fifteen to twenty years," Dr. Vasquez said. "Not a dramatic event.
Not a mass die-off that makes the evening news. A slow, progressive
loss of dissolved oxygen that will kill the bay from the bottom up.
The crabs will go first. Then the oysters. Then the rockfish. Then
the grasses. Then everything else. And once it's gone, it's gone.
You don't bring back a dead estuary."

The story was three thousand words long. Margaret had spent four
months writing it. Every fact had been verified by at least two
independent sources. The documents had been authenticated by a
forensic information specialist. The science had been reviewed by
three independent ecologists, all of whom confirmed Dr. Vasquez's
conclusions.

It was, by any professional standard, an exemplary piece of
investigative journalism.

The response began within hours.


                               IV.

The first wave was silence. The story appeared on the Herald-
Examiner's website at midnight Saturday, timed for maximum Sunday
readership, and for the first six hours, nothing happened. No
comments, no shares, no pickups by other outlets. Margaret had
expected this -- Sunday mornings were slow -- but the silence had
a quality she didn't like. It felt deliberate. As though the
information ecosystem had looked at the story and decided, through
some collective unconscious process, to pretend it didn't exist.

The second wave was noise. At approximately 10:00 AM, the story
broke through some threshold of visibility and began to circulate.
Within two hours, it had been shared forty thousand times. Within
four hours, a hundred and twenty thousand. Margaret watched the
numbers climb on her analytics dashboard and felt nothing. She had
learned that shares were not the same as reads, reads were not the
same as comprehension, and comprehension was not the same as belief.

The third wave was the counterattack.

It came from multiple directions simultaneously, with a coordination
that was either orchestrated or emergent -- Margaret could never
determine which, and she had come to suspect that the distinction
no longer mattered.

From the right: the story was a hoax, fabricated by environmental
extremists to justify government overreach. The documents were
forgeries. Dr. Vasquez was a political operative with ties to radical
environmental organizations. The Herald-Examiner was a mouthpiece for
the regulatory state. The real story was not the contamination of the
bay but the contamination of the press by activists posing as
journalists.

From the left: the story didn't go far enough. The contamination was
not merely the result of agricultural runoff but of a deliberate
corporate strategy to externalize costs onto public resources. The
Herald-Examiner was complicit in this strategy because it had accepted
advertising revenue from agricultural companies and because its
coverage of environmental issues was, historically, insufficiently
radical. The real story was not the bay but capitalism itself, and
any reporting that failed to name capitalism as the root cause was
not journalism but propaganda.

From the center: the story was probably true in its broad outlines
but the details were uncertain, the science was contested, the
documents might have been taken out of context, and in any case,
there were reasonable people on both sides, and the responsible
approach was to wait for more information before drawing conclusions.

From the fringes: the story was a distraction from the real crisis,
which was [insert preferred crisis here: the surveillance state, the
coming economic collapse, the secret government weather-modification
program, the alien presence that the government was concealing, the
imminent rapture]. Anyone who paid attention to the Chesapeake Bay
when [preferred crisis] was the actual threat was either a dupe or
a collaborator.

Margaret read the responses with the grim, methodical attention of
a pathologist performing an autopsy. She was not looking for agreement
or disagreement. She was looking for engagement -- for evidence that
anyone, anywhere, was actually processing the information she had
reported and drawing conclusions based on its content rather than on
their prior commitments.

She found very little.


                               V.

The Department of Environmental Stewardship issued a statement on
Monday afternoon. Margaret read it with the specialized literacy of
a reporter who had been decoding government communications for
decades, and she admired its craftsmanship even as she deplored its
purpose.

The statement did not deny the existence of the documents. It did not
confirm them either. It acknowledged that "data management practices
within the Department are under continuous review" and that "the
Department is committed to the highest standards of scientific
integrity." It noted that "the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem is complex
and dynamic" and that "models of ecosystem behavior are subject to
ongoing refinement." It expressed "confidence in the Department's
career scientists" while simultaneously distancing the Department
from any specific scientist's conclusions. It promised "a thorough
internal review" that would "report its findings at the appropriate
time."

The statement was, in short, a masterpiece of saying nothing while
appearing to say everything, of acknowledging a crisis while
simultaneously defusing it, of promising action while guaranteeing
inaction.

Margaret had seen a hundred such statements. They were the dialect
of institutional survival, spoken fluently by every government
agency, every corporation, every organization that had learned
that the most effective response to a damaging revelation was not
denial -- denial was confrontational, denial invited scrutiny --
but absorption. You absorbed the story. You surrounded it with
qualifications, with context, with competing narratives, with
promises of review. You didn't fight the information; you drowned
it in more information, the way you might extinguish a fire not by
smothering it but by flooding the room.

The statement worked. By Tuesday, the story had been absorbed into
the general noise of the news cycle. It was still there --
technically, digitally, retrievable by anyone who searched for it --
but it had lost its salience, its urgency, its capacity to compel
attention or action. It had become one data point among millions,
one signal in an ocean of noise, one small true thing in a world
that had lost the ability to distinguish truth from its absence.


                               VI.

Margaret went to the Chesapeake Bay.

She drove from Washington on a Wednesday morning in early April,
taking Route 50 east through Annapolis and across the Bay Bridge
to the Eastern Shore. She had no professional reason to go. The
story had been filed, published, and forgotten. She went because
she needed to see the thing she had written about, the way a
doctor who has diagnosed a terminal illness sometimes needs to sit
with the patient.

The bay was beautiful. That was the cruelest part. The water
stretched to the horizon under a sky of luminous, rain-washed blue.
Gulls wheeled above the surface. A skipjack moved slowly northward
under a white sail. The shoreline was green with the first growth
of spring, the marshes coming alive with cordgrass and cattails.

An uninformed observer would have seen paradise. Margaret, informed,
saw a patient in the early stages of a disease that had not yet
produced visible symptoms but was already, in the chemistry of the
water and the biology of the sediment, irreversibly advanced.

She drove to a boat ramp near Tilghman Island and stood at the
water's edge. The bay lapped at the concrete. It was the color of
strong tea -- tannin-stained, turbid with suspended sediment and
algal bloom. Margaret knew that the dissolved oxygen level in the
deeper water was, according to Dr. Vasquez's data, approximately
forty percent below the threshold required to support benthic
organisms. The crabs were already stressed. The oyster beds were
already declining. The submerged grasses that provided habitat for
juvenile fish were already thinning, their photosynthesis choked
by the algal blooms that the excess nitrate fertilized.

None of this was visible. The catastrophe was invisible. That was
the fundamental problem -- not just with this story but with the
entire category of slow-moving environmental disaster that Margaret
had spent her career trying to make people see. The human perceptual
system was designed to detect sudden changes: a predator charging,
a cliff edge approaching, a fire spreading. It was not designed to
detect gradual changes: the slow acidification of water, the
incremental loss of topsoil, the year-by-year decline of a species
population. By the time the change became visible, it was too late.
The tipping point had already been crossed. The irreversible had
already become irreversed.

And now, layered on top of this perceptual limitation, was the
epistemic crisis. Even if people could perceive the change, they
would not believe it. Even if they believed it, they would not
agree on its cause. Even if they agreed on its cause, they would
not agree on the response. And while the arguments raged, the
nitrate flowed and the oxygen declined and the bay died, quietly,
invisibly, unbelieved.

Margaret stood at the water's edge and watched the skipjack sail
north and thought about the watermen who still worked the bay, the
families who had crabbed and oystered these waters for generations,
who knew the bay's health the way a farmer knows the health of soil:
by smell, by color, by the weight of the catch. They believed. They
didn't need documents or scientific models or investigative journalism
to tell them what they hauled up in their nets every day. The crabs
were smaller. The oysters were fewer. The water was wrong.

But no one listened to them either.


                               VII.

She went back to Washington and tried again.

Not the same story -- the same story was dead, absorbed, composted
into the topsoil of the news cycle. A new story. A different angle.
Margaret had learned, over the years, that the key to environmental
reporting was not to report the environment -- people didn't care
about the environment, not really, not enough -- but to report the
human consequences. The bay was dying: that was an abstraction. The
people who depended on the bay were losing their livelihoods: that
was a story.

She drove back to the Eastern Shore and spent two weeks interviewing
watermen, restaurant owners, marina operators, fishing guides --
the people whose lives were built on the bay's health and who were
watching that health decline in real time, in their nets and their
cash registers and their children's decisions to leave for Baltimore
or Washington rather than continue a family tradition that no longer
paid the bills.

She interviewed Bobby Davenport, a third-generation crabber from
Smith Island, who told her that his catch was down sixty percent
from his father's time and that he was supplementing his income
by driving a delivery truck three days a week. "The crabs know
something's wrong," Bobby said. "They're moving north, looking for
cooler water, cleaner water. I'm running out to where my granddaddy
never had to go, and I'm bringing back half of what he'd bring
back from right here by the island."

She interviewed Maria Gonzalez, who owned a seafood restaurant in
Oxford that had been in her husband's family for forty years.
"People come for the crab cakes," Maria said. "They come for the
view, the boats, the waterman thing. But the crab meat comes from
Louisiana now, most of it. I can't get enough local crab to fill
my orders. I can't afford it when I can get it. And I can't tell
my customers, because they're paying for the fantasy. They want
to believe they're eating Chesapeake Bay blue crab. So I let them
believe it."

She interviewed Tommy Park, a fishing guide who took tourists out
for rockfish. "I know where the fish are," Tommy said. "I've been
on this water thirty years. But there are fewer fish every year,
and they're smaller, and they're stressed. You can see it in their
gills -- they're working harder to breathe. The water's not right.
Anybody who spends time on the water knows the water's not right.
But if I say that to my clients, they look at me like I'm trying to
sell them something. Like I'm running a scam. That's what it's come
to. You tell people the truth and they think it's a scam."

Margaret wrote the story. Two thousand words. Human faces, human
voices, human consequences. She gave it everything she had --
twenty-eight years of craft, of knowing how to shape information
into narrative, how to make the abstract concrete, how to compel
attention and empathy and, if she was very good and very lucky,
action.


                               VIII.

The story ran on a Thursday. Two thousand words, above the fold,
with photographs by Luis Medina that were as eloquent as anything
Margaret had written: Bobby Davenport hauling a half-empty pot
from grey-green water, his face a map of erosion; Maria Gonzalez
standing in her restaurant kitchen with a box of Louisiana crab
meat, her expression a complicated blend of guilt and defiance;
Tommy Park on the bow of his boat, pointing at something in the
water that the camera couldn't see.

Margaret waited for the response.

The response was sympathetic. That was new, and for a brief,
intoxicating moment, Margaret allowed herself to feel hope.

The story was shared widely. The comments were, by the debased
standards of online discourse, relatively civil. People expressed
concern for the watermen. People expressed outrage at the
government's inaction. People expressed a desire to help.

The desire to help lasted approximately seventy-two hours.

On Sunday, a celebrity's marriage collapsed in public and
spectacular fashion. On Monday, a senator from a western state
made a provocative statement about immigration that was calibrated,
with surgical precision, to dominate the news cycle. On Tuesday,
a tech company announced a new product that would, its CEO
promised, "revolutionize the way we experience reality."

By Wednesday, the Chesapeake Bay was gone. Not literally. Literally,
it was still there, still beautiful, still dying. But informationally,
it was gone. Displaced. Overwritten. The public's attention had moved
on, the way a searchlight moves on, illuminating one patch of
darkness and then another, never resting long enough on any one
patch to see what it actually contains.

Margaret sat at her desk and stared at her analytics dashboard.
The story's traffic had declined by ninety-four percent in six
days. She closed the dashboard and opened a new document and sat
for a long time, her fingers on the keyboard, and did not type.


                               IX.

She went to see Dr. Vasquez.

Helen Vasquez had been placed on administrative leave four days
after Margaret's original story ran -- not fired, which would have
created a narrative, but suspended with pay pending the results of
the "thorough internal review" that the Department had promised.
She was at home in her apartment in Silver Spring, a small, tidy
place filled with books and framed photographs of fieldwork -- Helen
knee-deep in marsh water, Helen on a research vessel, Helen holding
up a water sample with the expression of a woman who has found what
she was looking for and wishes she hadn't.

"I knew what would happen," Helen said. She was sitting at her
kitchen table with a mug of coffee that she had not drunk. "I knew
before I agreed to go on the record. My colleagues told me. My
lawyer told me. My husband told me. Everyone told me the same
thing: it won't matter."

"Then why did you do it?" Margaret asked.

Helen looked at her coffee. "Because it's true," she said. "Because
the bay is dying and someone needed to say so on the record. Because
I'm a scientist and science is the practice of saying what is true
regardless of whether anyone wants to hear it."

She paused.

"But also because I thought -- I still thought, despite everything,
despite knowing better -- that truth had power. That if you could
document the evidence, present it clearly, make it available to the
public, the public would respond. That people would read the data
and understand the data and act on the data. Because that's how it's
supposed to work. That's the theory. Information leads to knowledge,
knowledge leads to understanding, understanding leads to action."

"And instead?"

Helen smiled. It was not a happy smile.

"And instead, the information enters the atmosphere and is
immediately metabolized by a system that converts everything --
truth, lies, opinion, propaganda, science, nonsense -- into content.
And content has no truth value. Content is just... material. Stuff
that flows through the pipes. And the pipes don't care what's in
them."

Margaret nodded. She had arrived at the same conclusion, by a
different route, years ago.

"So what do we do?" she asked.

Helen looked at her for a long time.

"We keep saying it," she said. "We say it knowing that no one will
believe us. We say it knowing that it won't change anything. We say
it because it's true, and because saying true things is what we do,
and because if we stop saying true things, then the only things left
in the atmosphere will be the untrue things, and that would be worse.
That would be the end."

"Would anyone notice?"

"No," Helen said. "That's the point. That's exactly the point. No
one would notice. The bay would die and no one would notice until
the crabs were gone and the water stank and the fishing industry
collapsed, and then people would say, 'Why didn't anyone warn us?'
And we would say, 'We did. We warned you. We documented it and
published it and testified about it and put it on the record.' And
they would say, 'Well, I didn't see it.' And they would be telling
the truth. They didn't see it. Not because it wasn't visible but
because seeing requires believing that what you see is real, and
they had lost that capacity. They had lost it the way the bay lost
its oxygen: slowly, invisibly, irreversibly."


                               X.

The summer came. The bay bloomed.

Not the good kind of bloom -- not the flowering of aquatic grasses,
the return of life to depleted waters. The bad kind. Algal bloom.
Vast, green, spreading mats of cyanobacteria that fed on the excess
nitrate and consumed the dissolved oxygen and left the deeper water
as lifeless as the surface of the moon.

Margaret reported it. She reported it with photographs -- satellite
images showing the bloom's extent, which covered nearly forty
percent of the bay's surface area, a record. She reported it with
data -- dissolved oxygen readings from monitoring stations that
showed levels consistent with Dr. Vasquez's worst-case projections.
She reported it with human stories -- watermen who couldn't work,
beach communities that couldn't swim, a seafood industry that was
quietly sourcing its product from everywhere except the Chesapeake
Bay.

The story ran. The story was shared. The story was absorbed.

The Department of Environmental Stewardship issued a statement
acknowledging that "algal bloom conditions have been observed in
portions of the Chesapeake Bay" and noting that "such blooms are a
natural and periodic feature of estuarine ecosystems." The statement
promised "continued monitoring" and "adaptive management
strategies."

A trade group representing the agricultural industry issued a
statement questioning the link between nitrate runoff and algal
blooms, citing "alternative hypotheses" including natural nutrient
cycling, climate variability, and "changes in bay hydrodynamics."
The statement was accompanied by a report produced by a consulting
firm retained by the trade group, which reached conclusions
diametrically opposed to those of every independent scientist
Margaret had consulted.

A coalition of environmental organizations issued a statement
calling for emergency action, including mandatory reductions in
agricultural runoff, restoration of wetland buffers, and the
immediate removal of Deputy Secretary Marsh. The statement was
passionate, well-documented, and addressed to an audience that
already agreed with it.

The three statements -- the government's, the industry's, and the
environmentalists' -- entered the information ecosystem and
immediately neutralized each other, like matter meeting antimatter.
They produced a burst of energy -- online arguments, op-eds,
television segments in which representatives of each position
shouted at each other with performative intensity -- and then they
annihilated, leaving behind a residue of confusion and exhaustion
that was functionally indistinguishable from the confusion and
exhaustion that had preceded them.

The bay kept dying. Nobody believed anything.


                               XI.

Margaret thought about quitting.

She thought about it in the specific, practical way of a person who
was not prone to dramatic gestures but who had arrived, through the
accumulation of evidence, at a conclusion she could no longer avoid.
She thought about what she would do instead -- teach, perhaps, at
one of the journalism schools that still existed, passing on skills
to students who would enter a profession that was, she increasingly
suspected, no longer functional. Or write books -- long-form work
that could take the time the news cycle wouldn't allow, that could
build an argument across hundreds of pages rather than thousands of
words, that could reach the reader who still existed somewhere out
there, the reader who was willing to sit with a complex truth and
let it work on them.

But even as she thought about it, she knew she wouldn't do it.
She knew it the way Bobby Davenport knew that crabbing was
dying and went out in his boat anyway, the way Helen Vasquez knew
that nobody would listen and spoke on the record anyway, the way
Tommy Park knew the fish were declining and took his clients out
on the water anyway. Because the work was the work. Because the
work had value whether or not anyone recognized it. Because the
alternative to doing the work was not doing the work, and not doing
the work was surrender, and surrender was not in Margaret's
vocabulary.

She sat at her desk in the offices of the Washington Herald-
Examiner, which was itself a dying institution -- its circulation
declining, its advertising revenue collapsing, its newsroom
shrinking through attrition and buyouts, its physical building
showing the same slow, accumulative decay as the bay itself -- and
she opened a new document and began to write.


                               XII.

The autumn came. The bloom receded, as blooms do, leaving behind
a bay that was measurably worse than it had been the year before.
The monitoring data showed it. The watermen's catches showed it.
The empty restaurant tables on the Eastern Shore showed it.

Margaret wrote another story. And another. And another. A series,
now -- a sustained, methodical documentation of a catastrophe in
progress, published at monthly intervals, each installment building
on the last, each adding another layer of evidence, another human
voice, another data point in a case that was, by any rational
standard, beyond dispute.

The stories were good. Margaret knew they were good the way a
carpenter knows when a joint is square. They were factual. They
were human. They were true.

And they changed nothing.

The bay died a little more each month. The government reviewed and
monitored and adapted. The industry questioned and funded and lobbied.
The environmentalists protested and litigated and fundraised. The
public scrolled and clicked and shared and moved on.

Margaret kept writing. She kept writing because it was true, and
because saying true things was what she did, and because the
alternative was silence, and silence was complicity, and complicity
was surrender.

And there, in the gap between the truth and its reception, in the
space between the signal and the noise, in the distance between what
she knew and what anyone was willing to believe, Margaret Osei
practiced her craft. She wrote clearly. She verified thoroughly.
She told the truth. She committed acts of journalism in a society
that had lost the capacity to metabolize journalism, the way the
bay had lost the capacity to metabolize nitrogen, and the parallel
was exact and terrible and she could not stop thinking about it.

The bay was choking on abundance. Too much nitrogen, too much algae,
too much growth, not enough oxygen.

The country was choking on abundance. Too much information, too much
content, too much noise, not enough truth.

Both systems were dying of excess. Both were dying in plain sight.
Neither death would be believed until it was complete.


                               XIII.

One evening in November, Margaret drove to the bay.

She parked at the same boat ramp near Tilghman Island where she
had stood in April. The light was different now -- lower, colder,
the autumn sun declining toward the tree line, casting long shadows
across the water. The air smelled of salt and decay. The marshes
were brown with the year's dying.

The bay was still beautiful. That was still the cruelest part.

Margaret stood at the water's edge and looked out at the vast,
flat, tannin-dark expanse and thought about all the stories it
contained. The stories of the watermen and the scientists and the
politicians and the lobbyists. The stories of the crabs and the
oysters and the rockfish and the grasses. The stories of the nitrate
molecules, each one a tiny, invisible messenger carrying the
consequence of a decision made somewhere upstream -- a farmer's
choice to apply another round of fertilizer, a regulator's choice
to look the other way, a legislator's choice to accept a campaign
contribution, a consumer's choice to buy the cheaper food.

All of those stories were true. All of them were documented.
All of them were available to anyone who cared to look.

Nobody looked. Nobody believed.

The bay lapped at the boat ramp. A heron stood in the shallows,
motionless, watching the water with the absolute patience of a
creature that does not need to believe in fish to catch them. The
heron was not troubled by epistemology. The heron did not read the
news. The heron stood in the water and waited and when a fish
appeared, the heron struck, and the fish was real whether anyone
believed in it or not.

Margaret watched the heron and felt something shift inside her.
Not hope -- she was too experienced for hope. Not resignation --
she was too stubborn for resignation. Something else. Something
that did not have a name in the vocabulary of journalism but that
she recognized from the vocabulary of her Ghanaian grandmother, who
had told her, when she was a child: "Speak the truth even if your
voice shakes, even if no one is listening, even if the truth itself
seems to have forgotten its own name. The truth does not need to be
believed to be true. It only needs to be spoken."

Margaret stood at the water's edge and the bay lapped at the
concrete and the heron caught a fish and the sun declined and the
shadows lengthened and somewhere in the deep water, in the dark
where the oxygen was failing, the bay continued its slow dying,
and Margaret continued her slow telling, and neither the dying
nor the telling required anyone's belief, and both were true, and
both continued.


                               XIV.

She drove back to Washington.

She went to the office. She sat at her desk. She opened a new
document. She began to write.

The headline would read: "CHESAPEAKE BAY: A YEAR OF DYING."

It would be the capstone of her series. It would synthesize a
year's worth of reporting into a comprehensive, devastating,
meticulously documented account of an ecosystem in collapse and a
political system unable or unwilling to respond. It would be the
best thing she had ever written.

She knew this because she could feel it in her fingers, in the
precise, unhurried rhythm of her typing, in the clarity of the
sentences as they emerged, each one placed with the care of a mason
setting stone. She was not writing for the news cycle. She was not
writing for the analytics dashboard. She was not writing for the
Department of Environmental Stewardship or the agricultural industry
or the environmental coalition or any of the other institutions
that would absorb her story and metabolize it into their respective
narratives.

She was writing for the record.

The record was the only thing that survived. The record was what
remained when the news cycle had moved on and the attention had
scattered and the arguments had exhausted themselves and the noise
had dissipated. The record was what a future historian would find
when they went looking for what had happened to the Chesapeake Bay,
the way a geologist finds the record of an ancient catastrophe in
the composition of a sediment layer.

Margaret Osei, reporter, wrote for the record.

She wrote: "The Chesapeake Bay is dying. This is not a prediction.
This is not an opinion. This is not a political position. This is a
documented, verified, scientifically established fact, supported by
a decade of data, confirmed by the government's own scientists, and
visible to anyone who spends time on the water. The bay is dying.
It is dying because we are killing it. We are killing it with
nitrogen runoff from agricultural operations that we have chosen not
to regulate. We are killing it slowly, invisibly, and, if current
trends continue, irreversibly."

She wrote and the words accumulated on the screen and the story took
shape, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, the way the
contamination had accumulated in the bay, molecule by molecule, year
by year.

Outside her window, Washington continued. The traffic moved. The
government governed. The lobbyists lobbied. The media mediated.
The citizens, such as they were, went about the business of their
lives, which did not include thinking about the Chesapeake Bay,
which was too slow to be urgent and too diffuse to be dramatic and
too complex to be reduced to a headline and too true to be believed.

Margaret wrote. The bay died. Nobody believed anything. The truth
persisted anyway, the way the water persisted, the way the nitrogen
persisted, the way the heron persisted, standing in the shallows,
patient, watchful, indifferent to belief, waiting for the fish.

The fish was there. The fish was always there. Whether anyone
believed in it or not.

[THE END]

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

COL. JAMES "BUCK" STANTON (RET.) flew P-51 Mustangs over Europe and
commanded a fighter wing in Korea before retiring to his ranch outside
Fredericksburg, Texas, where he has been writing military science
fiction of uncommon honesty since 1953. His stories have appeared in
these pages since Issue #6, and his work is distinguished by the
authority of a man who has actually experienced the things he writes
about. "Escalation Protocols" is, he tells us, "the story I've been
trying to write since the briefings started coming in from Southeast
Asia." He lives with his wife Martha, two horses, and a dog named
Pershing.

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a physicist at Caltech and has been a
contributor to these pages since our third issue. His fiction has
won three Hugo nominations and the enduring admiration of readers
who appreciate science fiction that takes science seriously. "The
Probability Garden" represents something of a departure for Koslov
-- a story more lyrical and contemplative than his usual rigorous
hard SF -- and we think it is among his finest work. He is currently
at work on a novel about gravitational wave detection that he
describes as "a love story disguised as physics, or possibly the
reverse."

DOLORES REYES made her debut in these pages with "The Colony of
Forgetting" in Issue #53, and "Burning Lexicon" is her third
appearance. Born in El Paso and now dividing her time between Texas
and Mexico City, Reyes writes about the spaces between cultures,
languages, and worlds with a lyrical intensity that is entirely her
own. Her work draws equally from the traditions of American science
fiction and Latin American literary fiction, and she sees no boundary
between them. She is at work on a novel and a collection of stories
that she describes as "love letters to every border I have ever
crossed."

THEODORE CAIN has appeared in more issues of this magazine than any
other writer, and we remain grateful for his reliability, his
versatility, and his quiet craftsmanship. "Tomorrow's Vintage" is
one of his periodic returns to the subject of wine and time, two
things he considers "essentially identical." He works as a technical
writer for General Motors in Dearborn, Michigan, writes every evening
from eight to midnight, and maintains a small wine collection that
he insists is "research." He lives with his wife Jean and their
three children.

OSCAR LENNOX teaches history at Boston University and writes alternate
histories of such erudition and inventiveness that his academic
colleagues have been known to check his footnotes before remembering
that his stories are fiction. "Phantom Continents" is his most
ambitious work to date -- a story that spans two thousand years of
alternate history and multiple possible realities. He lives in
Brookline, Massachusetts, with his wife Patricia and an apartment
full of maps, timelines, and books organized by a system that only
he understands.

GUNNAR ERIKSSON lives in Stockholm, where he works as a literary
translator and writes, in English, the austere and beautiful science
fiction that has made him one of the most distinctive voices in the
genre. His generation ship stories, beginning with "The Long Watch"
in Issue #16, have established a tradition of their own -- stories
of vast distances, deep solitude, and the stubborn persistence of
hope in the dark. "Nightwatch" continues this tradition with what
we believe is his most profound and moving meditation on the subject.
He lives with his wife, the painter Ingrid Bergstrom, and reports
that Stockholm in November provides all the darkness and isolation
a writer of deep-space fiction could require.

FRANKLIN HOYT is a former journalist, a graduate of Howard University,
and the most fearlessly political writer in science fiction. His
stories have appeared in these pages since Issue #14, and each one
has been a provocation -- not in the cheap sense of provocation for
its own sake, but in the essential sense of compelling the reader
to confront uncomfortable truths about power, institutions, and the
distance between American ideals and American practice. "Nobody
Believes Anything" is perhaps his most unsettling story, and we
suspect it may also prove his most prophetic. He lives in Washington,
D.C., with his wife Barbara, a civil rights attorney, and their
three children.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Max and Diana,

I have just finished reading Issue #53 and I must write immediately
regarding Cassandra Voss's "The Ambassador's Gambit." It is, without
qualification, the finest piece of diplomatic science fiction I have
ever encountered. As a retired Foreign Service officer who spent
thirty years negotiating with governments that operated on assumptions
fundamentally different from our own, I can tell you that Voss
captures the texture of cross-cultural diplomacy with an accuracy
that borders on the uncanny. The scene in which Ambassador Chen
realizes that her negotiating counterpart's concept of "agreement"
bears no relation to her own is something I experienced, in various
forms, at least a dozen times in my career. More Voss, please.

                              -- Arthur Rutledge

                                 Chevy Chase, Maryland

Dear Editors,

Theodore Cain's "The Seed Vault" in Issue #52 was a solid piece of
work, as we have come to expect from Cain, but I must take issue
with his description of cryogenic seed storage protocols on page 47.
The temperatures he specifies (-120C) would be adequate for short-
term preservation but wholly insufficient for the thousand-year
storage period his narrative requires. The Svalbard Global Seed
Vault (which, I note, does not yet exist but which several
agricultural research institutions have proposed) would need to
maintain temperatures at or below -180C to ensure genetic viability
across such timescales. I have enclosed a paper from the Journal of
Agricultural Science that Mr. Cain may find useful for future stories
in this vein.

Dear Diana and Max,

I am a fourteen-year-old reader from Trenton, New Jersey, and I
want to say that Dolores Reyes's "The Colony of Forgetting" in
Issue #53 is the best story I have ever read in any magazine. My
parents are from Puerto Rico and sometimes I feel like I am
living between two worlds, and Ms. Reyes's story made me feel
like someone else understands that feeling. I want to be a writer
when I grow up and I want to write stories like hers. Can you
tell me how she learned to write like that?

                              -- Carmen Delgado
                                 Trenton, New Jersey

[Editor's note: We have forwarded your letter to Ms. Reyes, who
was deeply moved by it. She asks us to tell you: "Read everything.
Write every day. And never let anyone tell you that the space
between two worlds is empty. It is the fullest place there is."
We expect to hear from you again, Miss Delgado. -- D.F.]

Dear Sirs and Madam,

I have subscribed to your magazine since Issue #1 and I must say
that while I have generally admired the direction you have taken
since Mrs. Foxworth joined the editorial staff, I find myself
increasingly mystified by some of your story selections. What
happened to straightforward adventure? What happened to space
battles and alien encounters and the sheer excitement that drew
me to science fiction in the first place? I read Colonel Stanton
and I know where I am. I read Koslov and I know where I am. But
some of these newer writers -- I won't name names -- seem more
interested in impressing English professors than in entertaining
readers. I don't need my science fiction to be literature. I need
it to be fun.

                              -- Gerald Hickman
                                 Omaha, Nebraska

[Editor's note: Mr. Hickman, we respect your loyalty and your
candor, and we would gently suggest that the distinction between
literature and fun is less firm than you suppose. But we take
your point, and we promise that Colonel Stanton will continue to
appear in our pages for as long as he continues to write. In the
meantime, we hope you will give our newer voices a fair hearing.
They may surprise you. -- M.S.]

Dear Editors,

Gunnar Eriksson's "The Meridian" in Issue #51 reduced me to tears
on a crowded subway train, which is not a dignified experience for
a grown man but which I consider the highest possible compliment
to Mr. Eriksson's art. That final image of the watchkeeper standing
at the viewport, knowing he will never see the destination but
maintaining his vigil anyway -- I have not been able to stop
thinking about it. It is the most beautiful evocation of duty and
loneliness I have encountered in any literature, not just science
fiction.

                              -- Thomas Engel
                                 Brooklyn, New York

================================================================================

THE WHOLE MAN by John Brunner
(Ballantine Books, 1964, $0.50)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Brunner has given us, in this compact and penetrating novel, a
portrait of a telepath that is as far from the gleaming supermen of
pulp tradition as it is possible to travel without leaving the genre
entirely. Gerald Dowall is deformed, impoverished, and socially
marginal -- a cripple in the most literal sense -- and his telepathic
gift does not rescue him from his circumstances so much as add a new
dimension of complexity to an already difficult existence. Brunner
writes with a social realist's eye for the textures of poverty and
exclusion, and his treatment of telepathy as a psychological burden
rather than a superpower is both refreshing and moving. The novel's
structure -- a series of linked episodes rather than a conventional
narrative arc -- may frustrate readers who require a driving plot,
but those who are willing to sit with the book on its own terms will
find themselves in the company of a deeply intelligent and deeply
humane writer. Recommended.

MARTIAN TIME-SLIP by Philip K. Dick
(Ballantine Books, 1964, $0.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

I have been reading Mr. Dick's novels with increasing fascination and
increasing unease for the better part of a decade, and "Martian Time-
Slip" is, I believe, his finest work to date. Set on a colonized Mars
that bears less resemblance to the Red Planet of scientific exploration
than to the small, struggling communities of the American West, it
tells the story of a repairman, a schizophrenic child, and a union
boss, and the strange entanglement of their perceptions of time and
reality. Dick is not interested in the Mars of rockets and ray guns;
he is interested in the Mars of loneliness, mental illness, and the
slow erosion of consensus reality -- themes that resonate far beyond
their science-fictional setting. His prose is deceptively simple,
his plotting intuitive rather than logical, and his vision of a world
in which reality itself is unreliable has a prophetic quality that I
find both thrilling and deeply troubling. Essential reading.

NOVA EXPRESS by William S. Burroughs
(Grove Press, 1964, $1.95)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Burroughs's latest novel -- the third in his loose "Nova Trilogy"
-- will be received by science fiction readers with bewilderment,
outrage, or exhilaration, depending on their tolerance for radical
formal experimentation. Assembled through Burroughs's "cut-up"
technique, in which existing texts are literally sliced apart and
reassembled, "Nova Express" reads less like a conventional novel than
like a transmission received from a dimension where narrative logic
has been abolished. And yet -- and this is the crucial point --
something emerges from the chaos. A story, of sorts, about viral
invaders who control humanity through language itself, and a
resistance movement that fights them by disrupting the mechanisms
of linguistic control. It is, in its strange and fractured way, one
of the most purely science-fictional novels written by a literary
author, and it suggests possibilities for the genre that most genre
writers have not yet imagined. Not for everyone. But for those who
are ready for it, genuinely revolutionary. Recommended with caveats.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
        Next Issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #55 -- January 1965

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue, which will
be on newsstands in late December:

"THE TREATY OF LESSER WORLDS" by Cassandra Voss -- When a minor
diplomatic crisis between two alien civilizations threatens to
escalate into something far larger, a human mediator discovers that
the real conflict is not between the two civilizations but within
the institution she represents. Voss at her most politically
incisive.

"THE ASSEMBLY" by Theodore Cain -- Workers on a deep-space
construction platform face an impossible deadline, a malfunctioning
fabrication system, and a corporate management team that has never
built anything in its life. Cain does what he does best: writes
about competent people solving real problems under pressure.

"THE PROSTHETIC HEART" by Elaine Prescott -- A woman whose failing
heart is replaced with an artificial organ discovers that the device
is gradually influencing her emotional responses. A stunning debut
from a new writer who brings an engineer's precision and a poet's
sensibility to the question of where the human body ends and the
machine begins. We predict great things.

"THE INTERPRETER'S SILENCE" by Dolores Reyes -- A first-contact
linguist discovers that the alien language she is learning is
changing her in ways she cannot describe in any human tongue. Reyes
continues to explore the borderlands of language, identity, and
consciousness with her characteristic lyrical intensity.

"THE NIGHT GARDEN" by Dr. Vincent Koslov -- A botanist on a
generation ship discovers that the ship's arboretum is evolving
in unexpected directions, producing plants that bear no relation
to any terrestrial species. Koslov in a contemplative mood, blending
hard science with something approaching the mystical.

Plus: a new story by a writer whose name we are not yet at liberty
to reveal, letters from our readers, book reviews, and more.
