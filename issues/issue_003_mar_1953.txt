                    TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
                           by Maxwell Sterling
================================================================================

Dear Readers,

There is a word that haunts the corridors of every laboratory, every
engineering office, every government bureau where the future is being
assembled piece by careful piece. That word is "cost."

We speak of it in dollars and cents, of course. The cost of a rocket
motor. The cost of a cyclotron. The cost of the concrete and steel
that will one day form the bones of a city on another world. But
there is another ledger, one that is never audited and rarely
discussed, and it is in that ledger that the true price of progress
is recorded.

What does it cost a woman to spend her career tending machines that
will not bear fruit in her lifetime? What does it cost a society to
reduce its citizens to numbers in a vast and indifferent calculus?
What does it cost the orphans of a dead world to plant seeds they may
never see sprout? These are the questions that keep your editor awake
at night, and they are the questions that animate the stories in this,
our March issue.

Harold Mercer gives us a Mars that is not conquered but courted, one
patient percentage point at a time. Franklin Hoyt turns his cold eye
on the machinery of loyalty and finds it grinding human bones. Rex
Drummond, that irrepressible rogue, sends us to the asteroids for a
tale of revolution born from salvage. Theodore Cain asks what happens
when the machine we built to serve us has learned to dream. Agnes
Whitfield walks us through the ashes of a world that paid the
ultimate price for progress and finds, against all odds, something
green. And Cordell Beaumont takes us to a jungle moon where the cost
of celebration is more terrible than we could imagine.

Progress is not free. It never has been. The question — the only
question that matters — is whether we are willing to pay what it
demands, and whether we will have the wisdom to know when the price
is too high.

I believe we will. But belief, like progress, must be tested.

Yours from the future,
Maxwell Sterling

                       "THE GREENING OF ACIDALIA"
                        by Harold "Hal" Mercer
================================================================================

   I.

The number was 0.0031.

Katya Sorokin had been staring at it for eleven minutes, watching it
hover on the main display of Atmospheric Processing Station Nine like
a hummingbird that could not decide whether to land. The number
represented the percentage increase in free oxygen content across the
Acidalia Planitia basin for the month of October, 2187. It was, by
any reasonable engineering standard, excellent. It was three-tenths of
a thousandth of a percent above the projected baseline, and it meant
that the atmospheric processors were performing within nominal
parameters, which was all anyone had a right to expect from machines
that were trying to teach a dead planet to breathe.

She wrote the number in the logbook with a pencil. She had been
writing numbers in this logbook, or in its predecessors, for
twenty-two years. The pencils were manufactured on-site from Martian
graphite. The logbooks were shipped from Earth at considerable
expense, because no one on Mars had yet devised a paper mill that
could produce stock of sufficient quality for archival records, and
Katya Sorokin did not trust digital storage. Digital storage failed.
Pencil and paper endured.

"You're smiling," said Yuri, her shift supervisor, from the adjacent
console. He was a young man — twenty-eight, which on Mars counted as
barely formed — with the kind of earnest face that made Katya want to
give him homework.

"I'm not smiling."

"You are. Your left cheek does the thing."

"The number is good, Yuri. The number is very good."

"The number is always good. That's why it's boring."

She did not dignify this with a response. Yuri was a competent
technician but he had been born on Mars, which meant he had never
known a world where the air was not something you manufactured. He
could not appreciate what 0.0031 meant. He did not understand that
every tenth of a thousandth of a percent was a small, quiet miracle,
a whisper from the regolith that said: I can change. Given time, I
can become something else.

Station Nine sat on the western edge of the Acidalia basin, one of
fourteen primary atmospheric processing installations that formed
what the engineering corps called the Garland — a rough circle of
machines, each one a cathedral of pipes and compressors and
electrolysis chambers, drawing carbon dioxide from the thin Martian
atmosphere, cracking it, storing the carbon, and releasing the oxygen
back into the sky. The process was not fast. It was not dramatic. It
was, in point of fact, the slowest and most tedious form of
engineering that human beings had ever attempted, and Katya loved it
the way a gardener loves a perennial that blooms once a decade.

She had come to Mars at thirty-one, a chemical engineer from
Novosibirsk with a doctoral thesis on high-altitude atmospheric
chemistry and a stubbornness that her mother had once described as
"geologic." She had expected to stay five years. The five years had
become ten, the ten had become twenty, and now, at fifty-three, she
could not imagine living anywhere else. Earth was a place she
remembered the way one remembers a dream — vivid in spots, vague at
the edges, and ultimately beside the point.

The point was the number. The point was always the number.

Her days had a rhythm to them, as regular and predictable as the
processors themselves. She rose at 0530, Mars Standard Time, in her
quarters on the station's residential level — a small room, sparsely
furnished, with a window that faced east toward the basin's interior.
She showered in water recycled from the station's atmospheric
condensers, dressed in the standard-issue coveralls that all
engineering staff wore, and ate breakfast in the communal mess: a
bowl of hydroponically grown oatmeal, reconstituted fruit, and
coffee that was grown in the station's greenhouse and was, by any
objective standard, terrible, but which Katya drank anyway because
ritual mattered more than flavor.

By 0630 she was at her console in the main operations center,
pulling the overnight data from all fourteen stations in the
Garland. The data came in as a stream of numbers — atmospheric
composition readings, temperature profiles, wind speed and
direction, humidity levels, barometric pressure, solar radiation
intensity — and Katya read them the way a physician reads a patient's
vitals, looking for patterns, anomalies, anything that suggested the
vast system she oversaw was behaving in ways she had not anticipated.
She cross-referenced each reading against the historical database,
which contained fifty-one years of daily observations — over
eighteen thousand data points for each of the fourteen stations —
and she noted any deviations, however small, in her logbook.

The mid-morning hours were reserved for maintenance. Katya
personally inspected a different section of Station Nine each day,
rotating through the facility on a fourteen-day cycle that ensured
every component received her direct attention at least twice a month.
She checked seals, calibrated instruments, tested emergency systems,
and talked to the equipment the way some people talk to their plants
— quietly, encouragingly, with the implicit understanding that
machines, like living things, performed better when someone paid
attention to them.

Afternoons were for analysis and correspondence. She reviewed
reports from the other thirteen stations, communicated with the
engineering corps headquarters in Olympus City, filed her weekly
status updates with the Meridian Planetary Development Corporation
on Earth, and — in whatever time remained — read the latest
publications in atmospheric chemistry, materials science, and
planetary engineering, keeping herself current in a field that moved
slowly enough to reward patience but quickly enough to punish
complacency.

Evenings were her own. She spent them in her quarters, reading —
novels, mostly, imported from Earth on the same ships that brought
the logbooks. She had a particular fondness for Russian literature,
which she attributed to her upbringing, and for detective fiction,
which she attributed to her profession. Engineering, she had once
told Yuri, was detective work: the universe had committed a crime
against habitability, and it was the engineer's job to find the
evidence and build the case for a different verdict.

This was her life. It was quiet, methodical, and, to most outside
observers, profoundly unexciting. Katya would not have traded it
for anything on either planet.


   II.

The audit team arrived on a Tuesday, which Katya considered an
inauspicious sign. Nothing good had ever happened to her on a
Tuesday. She had been divorced on a Tuesday. She had lost the tip of
her left ring finger to a pressure valve on a Tuesday. And now, on a
Tuesday in November, three people from the Meridian Planetary
Development Corporation stepped off the shuttle at Acidalia Station
with briefcases and the particular expression of people who had come
to deliver bad news and were determined to call it good.

Their leader was a man named Garrett Lyle. He was perhaps forty-five,
with the broad shoulders and deep tan of someone who spent most of
his time on Earth and was very pleased about it. He shook Katya's
hand with both of his and told her that he had been "following her
work with tremendous admiration," which was the corporate way of
saying he had read her file on the shuttle.

"We're here to help," he said.

"I wasn't aware we needed help," Katya said.

"Everyone needs help, Chief Engineer. That's what makes us a
civilization."

The other two members of the team were a woman named Dr. Priya Shan,
who was introduced as a "terraforming acceleration specialist," and a
young man named Colton Briggs, whose title was "implementation
consultant," which Katya understood to mean that he was the one who
would actually do whatever it was they had come to do.

She gave them the standard tour. Fourteen hours of it, across three
days, because Station Nine was not a building but an ecosystem — a
sprawling complex of reactors, compressors, catalytic chambers,
filtration arrays, thermal regulators, condensation traps, and
monitoring stations spread across eleven square kilometers of Martian
hardpan. She showed them the primary electrolysis banks, where
carbon dioxide was split into carbon monoxide and free oxygen at a
rate of six hundred cubic meters per hour. She showed them the
secondary catalytic chambers, where the carbon monoxide was further
reduced to elemental carbon and stored in pressurized graphite blocks
that would one day — in fifty years, or a hundred, or two hundred —
be used as building material. She showed them the tertiary
filtration arrays, where trace gases were captured and sorted and
either stored or vented, depending on their utility. She showed them
everything, because she believed that if they could see what she saw
— the beauty of it, the patience of it, the sheer magnificent
stubbornness of machines teaching a planet to breathe — they would
understand.

Garrett Lyle nodded politely throughout. Dr. Shan took notes on a
tablet. Colton Briggs looked at his shoes.

On the evening of the second day, Katya found Dr. Shan alone in the
station's observation dome — a transparent blister on the roof of the
main building that offered a three-hundred-sixty-degree view of the
basin. The Martian sky was dark, the stars hard and bright without
the softening veil of a real atmosphere, and the thin crescent of
Phobos was rising in the east, a small, misshapen comma of light
against the black.

"It's extraordinary," Dr. Shan said. She was not looking at her
tablet. She was looking at the sky.

"It is."

"I grew up in Bangalore. I've never seen stars like this. The
atmosphere back home — even on a clear night, you can't see
more than a few hundred. Here..."

"Here you can see everything," Katya said. "Everything that light
has to show you. It's one of the compensations."

"For what?"

"For the rest of it. The dust. The cold. The radiation. The fact
that you can't walk outside without a suit. The fact that the
nearest tree is a hundred million kilometers away." She paused.
"You learn to take your beauty where you find it."

Dr. Shan was quiet for a moment. "How do you know the processors
are working? Really working, I mean? How do you know this isn't
just — maintenance? Keeping machines running for the sake of
keeping machines running?"

It was the most honest question anyone on the audit team had asked,
and Katya respected it. She pointed toward the western horizon,
where the atmospheric processors of Station Nine were invisible in
the dark but where, if you knew what to look for, you could see a
faint discoloration in the sky — a thickening, a haze, barely
distinguishable from the natural dust.

"That haze," Katya said. "Twenty years ago, it wasn't there. The
sky was thinner, clearer. The haze is oxygen and water vapor, in
quantities too small to measure with the naked eye but large enough
to change the color of a sunset. We are building an atmosphere,
Dr. Shan. One molecule at a time. It is the slowest construction
project in human history, and it is working."

Dr. Shan looked at the haze. She did not say anything. But something
changed in her expression — a softening, a shift, as if a question
she had not known she was carrying had just been answered.

On the fourth day, they presented their proposal.


   III.

The meeting took place in the station's main conference room, which
was a repurposed storage module with a table made from recycled
carbon composite and chairs that had been manufactured on Mars and
were therefore slightly uncomfortable in a way that was difficult to
articulate. Katya sat at one end of the table. Garrett Lyle sat at
the other. Dr. Shan stood beside a projection screen. Yuri sat
beside Katya, because she had asked him to attend and because she
wanted a witness.

"The Acidalia Garland has been in operation for fifty-one years,"
Dr. Shan began. She had a pleasant voice, the kind that was trained
for presentations. "In that time, the atmospheric oxygen content of
the Acidalia basin has increased from effectively zero to
approximately one point seven percent of Earth-normal partial
pressure. This is consistent with the original project timeline,
which projected full atmospheric viability in approximately three
hundred and twenty years from project initiation."

She paused. Katya waited. She knew what was coming the way an old
sailor knows a storm.

"Meridian Planetary Development has recently completed a five-year
research program into accelerated atmospheric processing," Dr. Shan
continued. "The program, designated Project Quicksilver, employs a
novel catalytic approach using engineered microorganisms — modified
cyanobacteria — to supplement the mechanical electrolysis process.
Preliminary models suggest that the integration of Quicksilver
organisms into the existing atmospheric processing infrastructure
could reduce the total terraforming timeline from three hundred and
twenty years to approximately seventy-five."

She let the number hang in the air. Seventy-five years. It was a
magic number, a political number. It was a number that meant the
people who approved the funding might live to see the result, which
was the only kind of number that corporations understood.

"That's preliminary modeling," Katya said.

"It is."

"Based on laboratory conditions."

"Based on extensive laboratory and limited field testing on analog
environments, yes."

"Limited field testing. How limited?"

Dr. Shan glanced at Garrett Lyle. He smiled. "Eighteen months of
field deployment on a two-hectare test plot in the Hellas basin," she
said.

"Two hectares." Katya did not inflect the words as a question. She
wanted them to hear the size of the number. "The Acidalia basin is
two point seven million square kilometers."

"We understand the scale differential, Chief Engineer," Garrett Lyle
said. "That's why we're proposing a phased integration, not an
overnight conversion."

"And what happens to the existing mechanical infrastructure during
this phased integration?"

"The mechanical systems would continue to operate in parallel during
the initial deployment phase. Over time, as the biological systems
demonstrate viability, the mechanical systems would be scaled back
and eventually decommissioned."

"Decommissioned."

"Phased out. Retired. Whatever terminology you prefer."

"I prefer 'destroyed,' because that is what will happen if you
introduce untested biological agents into a mechanical atmospheric
processing system that has been calibrated over five decades."

The room went quiet. Yuri shifted in his chair. Dr. Shan looked at
her tablet. Garrett Lyle maintained his smile, but it hardened at the
edges, the way smiles do when they stop being social and start being
tactical.

"Chief Engineer Sorokin," he said, "no one is proposing the
destruction of anything. We are proposing an enhancement. A way to
achieve the goal that you have spent your career working toward, only
faster."

"Faster is not better."

"With respect, that depends on your perspective. From the perspective
of Meridian Planetary Development, which has invested approximately
fourteen billion credits in the Acidalia project over five decades,
faster is considerably better. From the perspective of the nine
hundred thousand people living in Martian settlements who would like
to walk outside without a pressure suit before their grandchildren
die of old age, faster is better. From the perspective of — "

"From the perspective of the planet," Katya said, "faster is
irrelevant. The planet does not care about your timeline. The planet
does not care about your investment. The planet is a chemical system
of extraordinary complexity, and it will change at the rate it is
willing to change, and no amount of engineered bacteria will alter
that fundamental truth."

"The data suggests otherwise."

"The data suggests that you can grow cyanobacteria on two hectares of
Hellas regolith for eighteen months without immediately catastrophic
results. That is not the same as demonstrating long-term viability at
continental scale. It is not even close."

Garrett Lyle leaned back in his chair. "What would you need to see,
Chief Engineer? What data would convince you?"

Katya considered this. It was, she recognized, a fair question, and
she owed it a fair answer.

"Twenty years," she said. "A minimum of twenty years of field data
on a test plot of at least fifty square kilometers, with full
atmospheric monitoring, soil chemistry analysis, and biological
containment protocols. If, after twenty years, the data shows stable
oxygen production without degradation of the existing atmospheric
chemistry or contamination of the mechanical processing systems, I
would consider a limited phased integration."

"Twenty years."

"At minimum."

"That's not a timeline, Chief Engineer. That's a rejection."

"It is an engineering assessment, Mr. Lyle. The fact that you cannot
distinguish between the two is precisely the problem."


   IV.

They did not leave. Katya had hoped they would — had hoped that her
intransigence would send them back to Earth with their briefcases and
their models and their magic bacteria — but corporations did not
retreat. They maneuvered.

Garrett Lyle spent the next two weeks talking to everyone at Station
Nine except Katya. He talked to the junior engineers, the
maintenance crews, the life-support technicians, the cafeteria
staff. He was charming and attentive and he remembered everyone's
name, which Katya found unforgivable. He talked about the future in
the way that people who have never built anything talk about the
future — as a destination, not a process. He said things like "Don't
you want to see green fields in your lifetime?" and "Imagine what
Mars could be in fifty years instead of three hundred," and the
young people nodded, because the young always nod when someone tells
them the future can be accelerated.

Dr. Shan, meanwhile, was conducting what she called "compatibility
assessments" — running simulations on how the Quicksilver organisms
would interact with Station Nine's existing chemical processes. She
was meticulous about it, Katya had to admit. The simulations were
well-designed and the methodology was sound, as far as laboratory
methodology went. The problem was not the methodology. The problem
was the assumption embedded in the methodology, which was that a
planet could be modeled.

You could model a reactor. You could model a filtration system. You
could model a catalytic chamber. You could not model a planet. A
planet was not a system. A planet was a billion systems, interlocking
and interdependent and chaotic in the mathematical sense, and any
model that claimed to predict planetary-scale atmospheric behavior
over decades was not a model but a prayer dressed up in equations.

Katya knew this. She had spent twenty-two years learning it, one
data point at a time, from a planet that did not care what her models
predicted.

On the fourteenth day of the audit team's visit, Yuri came to her
office.

"They're going to go over your head," he said.

"I know."

"Lyle has been talking to Corporate. He says the board is going to
authorize a Quicksilver deployment with or without your approval."

"I know that too."

"So what are you going to do?"

Katya looked at her logbook. The last entry read: 0.0029. It was
slightly below the previous month, which was within normal variation
and not a cause for concern. But it was below, and she had stared at
it for longer than she should have, looking for meaning in a number
that was simply a number.

"I'm going to do what I always do," she said. "I'm going to take
readings."


   V.

The readings took her three days. She drove a crawler across the
basin, stopping at each of the fourteen stations in the Garland,
pulling atmospheric samples, testing soil chemistry, checking
equipment calibration. She had done this before — she did it every
quarter — but this time she did it with a thoroughness that bordered
on obsession, checking and rechecking every measurement, cross-
referencing every data point against the fifty-one-year historical
record.

The crawler was a twenty-year-old Meridian Model 7, a pressurized
six-wheeled vehicle designed for extended surface operations. Its
tires were made from a synthetic rubber compound that had been
reformulated specifically for Martian regolith, which was abrasive
enough to shred conventional rubber in a matter of weeks. Its cabin
was cramped — room for two, three if they were friendly — with a
fold-down bunk, a water recycler, a food warmer, and a small
laboratory bench with the basic analytical equipment Katya needed
for field testing: a portable spectrometer, a soil chemistry kit, a
set of calibrated atmospheric sensors, and a microscope that she had
bought with her own money because the standard-issue model was, in
her professional opinion, inadequate.

She drove alone. Yuri had offered to come, but Katya had declined.
This was work she needed to do by herself, in the silence of the
basin, with no company but the hum of the crawler's electric motors
and the thin whisper of the Martian wind against the hull. She
needed to think, and thinking, for Katya, required the particular
quality of solitude that only Mars could provide — a solitude so
vast, so absolute, that it made the inside of your own head feel
crowded by comparison.

Station by station, she worked her way around the Garland. At each
stop she followed the same protocol: park the crawler, suit up,
exit through the airlock, walk to the sampling grid, pull six
atmospheric samples from the standardized collection points, take
six soil cores from the companion positions, record ambient
temperature, pressure, wind speed, and humidity, photograph the
site from four cardinal directions, return to the crawler, process
the samples, log the data, compare against historical baselines.

It was meticulous, repetitive, unglamorous work. It was the work she
had been doing for twenty-two years. It was the work she loved.

What she found was not dramatic. It was not the kind of thing that
would make a headline or change a board meeting. It was the kind of
thing that only an engineer who had spent two decades on Mars would
notice, and it was this: the soil chemistry at the southern edge of
the basin was changing.

Not the atmospheric chemistry. The soil.

Over the past eighteen months — roughly coinciding, Katya noted with
a cold feeling in her stomach, with the period of the Quicksilver
field test in Hellas basin, three thousand kilometers to the south —
the iron oxide composition of the regolith at Stations Twelve,
Thirteen, and Fourteen had shifted. The shift was tiny. It was within
the margin of instrument error. But it was consistent across all
three stations and it was in a direction that should not have been
possible without biological activity.

Something was growing in the soil.

Not the Quicksilver organisms — they had not been deployed here, not
officially, not yet. But something. Some microorganism, perhaps
native, perhaps a contaminant from one of the settlements, perhaps
something else entirely, was metabolizing the iron oxide in the
regolith and producing trace amounts of magnetite.

Katya sat in the crawler at Station Fourteen and looked at the
numbers and felt the hair on the back of her neck stand up, not from
fear but from wonder.

She ran the analysis again. And again. She recalibrated the
spectrometer and ran it a fourth time. The results were consistent.
The iron oxide to magnetite conversion was real. It was happening
at trace levels — parts per billion, barely above the detection
threshold — but it was happening, and it was happening in a pattern
that was inconsistent with purely chemical processes and consistent
with biological mediation.

She put the sample under her microscope — the good one, the one she
had bought herself — and adjusted the magnification to its maximum
setting. The regolith looked like regolith: a jumble of oxidized
mineral grains, the characteristic rust-red of Martian soil. But
there, at the edges of the grains, in the interstices where
moisture might accumulate during the brief Martian summer, she saw
something that made her hands tremble. A discoloration. A faint
greenish tinge, barely visible, that clung to the mineral surfaces
like a whisper.

If it was what she thought it was — and she was not prepared to say
that it was, not yet, not without much more testing — but if it was,
then everything she had believed about Mars, everything the entire
scientific community had believed about Mars, was wrong. Mars was
not dead. Mars had never been dead. Mars had been sleeping, waiting,
gathering its strength in the crevices and interstices of its own
geology, and now, after billions of years, something was stirring.

The planet was changing on its own.

Not fast. Not dramatically. Not in any way that would satisfy
Garrett Lyle or the Meridian Planetary Development Corporation or
the nine hundred thousand people who wanted green fields in their
lifetime. But it was changing, the way all real change happens —
slowly, quietly, in the places no one was looking, by mechanisms no
one had predicted.

And if they flooded the basin with engineered cyanobacteria, if
they smothered the regolith with billions of modified organisms
designed to produce oxygen at maximum efficiency, they would never
know what this was. They would never know what Mars was trying to
become on its own terms. They would overwrite it, the way you
overwrite a palimpsest, and whatever was written underneath would be
lost forever.


   VI.

She presented her findings at the next meeting. She brought soil
samples. She brought spectrographic analyses. She brought eighteen
months of data, carefully plotted on charts she had drawn by hand
because she wanted the audit team to see the data as she saw it —
not as pixels on a screen but as marks on paper, made by a human
hand, representing something real.

"This is interesting," Dr. Shan said, and Katya could tell she meant
it.

"This is a microorganism," Katya said. "Possibly native. Possibly a
contaminant. We don't know, because we haven't had time to
characterize it. But it is present at three stations along the
southern edge of the basin, and it is metabolizing iron oxide in a
way that suggests biological nitrogen fixation is occurring at trace
levels in the regolith."

"If there's native biology," Dr. Shan said slowly, "that changes the
contamination protocols significantly."

"It changes everything significantly. If Mars has native
microorganisms — even at trace levels, even in just one basin — then
introducing engineered organisms without a full characterization and
impact assessment would be biological contamination on a planetary
scale. It would violate the Outer Space Treaty, the Mars Protocol,
and approximately fourteen other international agreements that
Meridian Planetary Development has signed."

Garrett Lyle's smile had disappeared entirely. "Let's not get ahead
of ourselves. You said this could be a contaminant from one of the
settlements."

"I said possibly. I don't know. And neither do you. And until we do
know — until we have characterized this organism and determined its
origin and assessed its relationship to the existing Martian
environment — deploying Quicksilver would be reckless."

"Or it could be a contaminant, in which case it's irrelevant."

"Nothing that is alive is irrelevant, Mr. Lyle."

The room was quiet for a long time. Dr. Shan was looking at the soil
samples with an expression that Katya recognized, because she had
worn it herself many times. It was the expression of a scientist who
has just realized that the question is bigger than the answer she was
sent to provide.

"She's right," Dr. Shan said finally. "We can't deploy without
characterization. If there's even a possibility of native biology,
the legal and scientific implications are — "

"I understand the implications," Garrett Lyle said. "How long would
characterization take?"

Katya and Dr. Shan looked at each other. For the first time since
the audit team had arrived, Katya saw something in the other woman's
eyes that she recognized: the patience of someone who understood that
some questions could not be rushed.

"Five years," Dr. Shan said. "At minimum."

"Five years to look at dirt."

"Five years to determine whether we are alone on this planet,"
Katya said. "Which, if you think about it, is the most important
question human beings have ever asked."

Garrett Lyle looked at the soil samples. He looked at the charts. He
looked at the number on the main display, which today read 0.0033,
which was very good, which was a small quiet miracle that no one in a
boardroom on Earth would ever understand.

"I'll have to consult with Corporate," he said.

"Of course," Katya said.


   VII.

Corporate took three months to respond, which was fast by corporate
standards. The response was a compromise, which was what Katya had
expected. Quicksilver would be suspended pending biological
characterization of the anomalous soil readings. A new research team
would be dispatched to Acidalia to conduct the characterization. The
mechanical atmospheric processing systems would continue to operate
at current capacity. The timeline for the characterization study was
set at five years, with annual review.

It was not a victory. Katya did not believe in victories. It was a
reprieve — five years of doing what she had always done, tending the
machines, reading the numbers, coaxing a planet toward something it
might or might not want to become.

On the day the audit team departed, Dr. Shan stopped by Katya's
office. She was carrying a small sealed container.

"I took a soil sample from Station Fourteen," she said. "For my own
analysis. I hope that's acceptable."

"It's your job," Katya said.

"For what it's worth, I think you're right. Not about Quicksilver
necessarily — I still believe the technology is sound. But about the
pace of it. About the importance of knowing what we're working with
before we change it."

"Thank you."

"Can I ask you something?"

"Of course."

"You've been here twenty-two years. The project won't be completed in
your lifetime. It probably won't be completed in your grandchildren's
lifetime. How do you — " She stopped, searching for the word. "How
do you sustain it? The commitment? The patience?"

Katya looked out the window of her office. The window faced east,
toward the center of the basin, where the Martian sky was the color
of rust and the horizon was a thin, sharp line against the dark. The
atmospheric processors were not visible from here — they were too far
away, spread across too much terrain — but she could see their
contrails, thin wisps of vapor rising from the electrolysis vents,
barely distinguishable from the dust.

"Do you know what 0.0031 percent means?" she asked.

"It's your monthly oxygen increase."

"It's a breath. One breath, from a planet that has been holding its
breath for three billion years. And every month, I get to be the one
who hears it. Every month, I get to write it down and say: there.
The planet breathed. It's not much. But it's real. And I would
rather have one real breath than a thousand simulated ones."

Dr. Shan nodded. She did not say anything else. She shook Katya's
hand and walked to the shuttle and flew back to Earth, carrying a
small container of Martian soil and, Katya hoped, a small measure of
understanding.


   VIII.

Six months later, the characterization team arrived. They were good
scientists — careful, methodical, unhurried. They set up their
laboratory at Station Fourteen and began the slow, painstaking work
of analyzing the anomalous soil readings. Katya visited them once a
week, not to supervise but to watch. She liked watching scientists
work. She liked the way they held the samples, gently, the way you
hold something that might be alive.

The numbers continued. 0.0030. 0.0032. 0.0028. 0.0034. Up and down,
in the narrow band of normal variation, the planet breathing in and
breathing out, one month at a time.

Katya wrote each number in the logbook with a pencil. She did not
smile. Her left cheek did not do the thing. She simply wrote the
numbers down, because that was her job, and because the numbers were
real, and because sometimes the most radical act of engineering is
the decision to keep going.

On the last day of the fiscal year, Yuri brought her a cup of coffee
— real coffee, imported from Earth at absurd expense — and asked her
if she had made a resolution.

"I don't make resolutions," she said.

"Everyone makes resolutions."

"Not engineers. Engineers make projections."

"Fine. What's your projection?"

She looked at the main display. The number read 0.0031. It was the
same number she had stared at eleven months ago, when the audit team
was still a rumor and the future was something that happened one
percentage point at a time. It was a good number. It was, by any
reasonable engineering standard, excellent.

"Same as always," she said. "One more breath."

She wrote it down.

================================================================================
                          "LOYALTY SUITE"
                         by Franklin Hoyt
================================================================================

The card arrived on a Wednesday, which should not have mattered
except that David Polk had always associated Wednesdays with a
particular species of dread — the heavy, marrow-deep dread of the
midweek, when the weekend was too far away to offer comfort and the
previous weekend too distant to provide sustenance. Wednesdays were,
in David's estimation, the day on which bad things chose to announce
themselves, and the card was no exception.

It was made of cream-colored stock, heavy and slightly textured, with
the seal of the Bureau of Civic Fidelity embossed in navy blue at
the top. Below the seal, in neat sans-serif type, were three lines:

         DAVID ALAN POLK
         CITIZEN ID: 7734-4401-8829
         LOYALTY SCORE: 842

David stared at the number. Then he put the card down on the kitchen
table, poured himself a second cup of coffee, and stared at it some
more.

His Loyalty Score was not 842. His Loyalty Score was 580. He knew
this with absolute certainty because he checked it every week on the
Bureau's public portal, the way all citizens checked their scores,
the way you checked your pulse or your bank balance or the weather —
compulsively, anxiously, aware that the number governed everything
and that everything depended on the number.

A score of 580 was adequate. It placed David in the middle of the
Civic Standard band, which entitled him to his current employment
(middle management at a regional logistics firm), his current
housing (a two-bedroom apartment in a B-class residential zone), his
current transportation privileges (municipal transit plus weekend
car-share access), and his current social standing (unremarkable).
A 580 was the score of a man who went to work, paid his taxes,
attended the quarterly Civic Affirmation meetings, and otherwise
attracted no attention whatsoever. It was, David had often reflected,
the score of a man who had made a career of being invisible.

A score of 842 was something else entirely.

842 was the Elite Civic band. 842 meant priority housing in an
A-class zone. It meant a private vehicle. It meant access to the
restricted shops where they sold real fruit and imported coffee and
clothing made from natural fibers. It meant invitations to the
civic receptions that David had only ever read about in the
approved newsletters. It meant, in the blunt vocabulary of the
system, that David Polk was a person of exceptional civic virtue
whose loyalty to the Republic was beyond question.

David Polk was not a person of exceptional civic virtue. David Polk
was a man who kept his head down, did as he was told, and nursed a
small, secret garden of doubts that he tended in the privacy of his
own skull, where no scanner could reach and no algorithm could
harvest.

There had been a mistake. That much was obvious. A clerical error, a
data entry transposition, a glitch in the vast and inscrutable
machinery of the Bureau of Civic Fidelity. Someone had fat-fingered
a number, and David Polk had been elevated from adequate to
exceptional through the simple alchemy of bureaucratic incompetence.

The correct thing to do was to report the error. David knew this
immediately and with total clarity. The Civic Conduct Code was
explicit on the subject: any citizen who became aware of an error in
their official records was obligated to notify the relevant bureau
within seventy-two hours. Failure to do so was classified as a
Category Three civic infraction, punishable by a score reduction of
up to fifty points. The system depended on the honesty of its
participants. The Republic depended on the system. Therefore,
honesty was not merely a personal virtue but a civic obligation, a
structural necessity, a load-bearing wall in the architecture of the
state.

David picked up the card. He turned it over. On the back, in
smaller type, was the Bureau's contact information: a phone number,
an address, and a portal URL. Below that, in italics, was the
Bureau's motto: FIDELITY IS FREEDOM.

He finished his coffee. He put on his coat. He went to work.


                           * * *

The Bureau of Civic Fidelity occupied a building on Seventh Avenue
that had once, in the old dispensation, been a department store.
The display windows had been bricked over and the facade clad in
gray limestone, giving it the look of a mausoleum that had been
repurposed for administrative use. David arrived at 8:47 on Thursday
morning, having taken a personal day from work — which would cost him
two points, or would have cost him two points if his score had been
580, but at 842 personal days were unlimited and unpenalized, a fact
he discovered when the automated attendance system at his office
waved him through without comment.

The lobby of the Bureau was vast and cold, floored in marble that
had been polished to a malicious shine. There was a reception desk
staffed by a woman whose expression suggested that she had been
carved from the same marble as the floor. Behind her, a wall of
directories listed the Bureau's departments in alphabetical order,
from ADJUDICATION to ZONE COMPLIANCE. David scanned the list for
anything that looked like it might handle corrections or
adjustments. He found:

   APPEALS — Room 4-12
   ASSESSMENT — Room 2-07
   CORRECTIONS (UPWARD) — Room 3-15
   REVIEW — Room 5-01

There was no listing for CORRECTIONS (DOWNWARD). David read the
list again, carefully. CORRECTIONS (UPWARD) was there, clear as
day, between COMPLIANCE MONITORING and CREDENTIAL VERIFICATION.
But there was no corresponding entry for downward corrections.

He approached the reception desk.

"I need to report an error in my Loyalty Score," he said.

The woman looked at him with an expression of such perfect
indifference that it could only have been achieved through years of
practice. "Nature of the error?"

"My score has been recorded as too high."

The woman's expression did not change. David had the impression that
it could not change, that it had been fixed at the factory and was
not user-adjustable.

"Too high," she repeated.

"Yes. My score should be 580. My card says 842."

"You wish to file an appeal for a score reduction."

"I wish to correct an error."

"Score reductions are processed through Appeals, Room 4-12. Take the
elevator to the fourth floor, turn left, follow the corridor to the
end."

"Thank you."

"You're welcome, citizen."

David took the elevator to the fourth floor, turned left, and
followed the corridor to the end, where he found Room 4-12. The
door was closed. On the door was a sign that read:

         APPEALS
         Hours: Monday, Wednesday, Friday
         9:00 AM — 12:00 PM

It was Thursday.

David stood in the corridor for a moment, feeling the particular
frustration of a man who has cleared his schedule to deal with a
problem and has been defeated by a schedule. He walked back to the
elevator, rode it down to the lobby, and approached the reception
desk again.

"Appeals is only open three days a week," he said.

"That is correct."

"Is there another department that can process a score correction?"

"Score corrections are processed through Corrections, Room 3-15."

"Corrections only handles upward corrections."

"That is correct."

"So downward corrections are handled through Appeals."

"That is correct."

"Which is closed today."

"That is also correct."

David considered his options. He could come back on Friday. He
could call the Bureau's phone number. He could submit a request
through the portal. He chose the phone number, because he wanted to
hear a human voice tell him that his problem was solvable, that the
machinery of the state was capable of admitting error and correcting
it.

He called from a public phone booth on the sidewalk outside the
Bureau. The automated system asked him to enter his Citizen ID. He
entered it. The system asked him to state the nature of his inquiry.
He said, "Score correction." The system transferred him to a
department. A recorded voice told him that his estimated wait time
was forty-five minutes. He waited. After forty-seven minutes, a
human voice answered.

"Corrections. How may I assist you?"

"I need to report an error in my Loyalty Score. My score has been
recorded as 842. It should be 580."

There was a pause. David heard the sound of keys being pressed. Then
the voice returned.

"Sir, I'm showing your current score as 842. That is the score on
file."

"I understand that. I'm telling you it's wrong. It should be 580."

"Sir, the Bureau does not process voluntary score reductions over the
phone. You would need to file a formal appeal in person at your
nearest Bureau office."

"I was just there. Appeals is closed today."

"Appeals is open Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, nine to twelve."

"Yes, I saw the sign. Can I make an appointment?"

"Appeals does not accept appointments. It operates on a first-come,
first-served basis."

"Is there any other way to — "

"Sir, I want to make sure you understand what you're requesting. You
are requesting a voluntary reduction in your Loyalty Score. Is that
correct?"

"I'm requesting a correction. My score is wrong."

"A downward correction. From 842 to 580."

"Yes."

Another pause. More keys.

"Sir, I'm required to inform you that a voluntary score reduction of
this magnitude will trigger a mandatory review by the Assessment
Division. During the review period, which typically takes between
six and eighteen months, your score will be provisionally set to
zero."

"Zero?"

"That is standard procedure for voluntary reduction requests
exceeding one hundred points."

"But I'm not requesting a reduction. I'm correcting an error."

"Sir, the system does not distinguish between voluntary reductions
and error corrections. The process is the same."

David leaned against the wall of the phone booth. A score of zero
was not the bottom of the Civic Standard band. A score of zero was
the absence of a score. It was the score of non-persons — people who
had been stripped of civic standing for crimes against the Republic.
Zero meant no employment, no housing, no transit privileges, no
access to shops or services. Zero meant, for all practical purposes,
civil death.

"Let me make sure I understand," David said carefully. "If I try to
correct this error, my score will be set to zero for six to eighteen
months while the correction is reviewed."

"That is correct, sir."

"And if I don't try to correct it?"

"Then your score remains at 842, sir."

"Even though it's wrong."

"Sir, the Bureau's records indicate a score of 842. That is the
official score on file. Whether it is 'wrong' in a subjective sense
is a matter for the Appeals process."

"It's not subjective. It's a factual error."

"Sir, I understand your concern. I would encourage you to visit
Appeals during operating hours to discuss your options. Is there
anything else I can help you with today?"

"No," David said. "No, I think that covers it."


                           * * *

He did not go to Appeals on Friday. He told himself it was because he
could not take another personal day so soon, which was true in the
narrow sense that his supervisor would notice, but which was also a
lie in the broader sense that his supervisor, upon checking David's
score of 842, would almost certainly grant him whatever he wanted
without question. The real reason he did not go to Appeals was that
he was afraid. Not of the Bureau, not of the process, but of zero.

Zero was a void. Zero was the place where citizens went when the
state had finished with them. He had seen zeroes on the street —
gaunt, shuffling figures in unmarked clothing, carrying their
belongings in plastic bags, waiting in lines at the charity kitchens
that the state permitted to exist as a demonstration of its mercy.
Zeroes were not arrested. They were not imprisoned. They were simply
erased from the systems that made modern life possible, and they
continued to exist in the gaps between those systems, like water
pooling in the cracks of a sidewalk.

David did not want to be water in a crack.

So he kept the card. He kept the score. He went to work on Monday
and noticed, for the first time, the way the security guard at the
lobby desk looked at his badge — not with the perfunctory glance he
was accustomed to, but with a small, involuntary straightening of
posture, the way people straightened when confronted with authority
they had not expected. His supervisor, a man named Greer who had
never shown David anything warmer than professional tolerance, stopped
by his desk to ask if he needed anything. The question was so
unprecedented that David nearly looked behind him to see if Greer
was talking to someone else.

"I'm fine," David said.

"Good, good. Listen, I've been meaning to say — you've been doing
excellent work. Really excellent. I've put you in for the quarterly
recognition."

"Thank you."

"You deserve it. People like you — people with your kind of civic
commitment — you're what makes this company work."

David nodded and said nothing, because there was nothing to say. His
work had not changed. His competence had not changed. The only thing
that had changed was a number on a card, and that number had
transformed him from an invisible functionary into a valued colleague
in the space of a week.

The absurdity of it gnawed at him. He could feel it in his chest, a
small, hard knot of something that might have been outrage or might
have been nausea — the two felt remarkably similar. The system was
not responding to him. It was responding to the number. The number
was wrong. Therefore, every response the system generated was wrong.
Every smile, every deference, every opened door and prioritized
request was built on a foundation of error, and the error was
compounding daily, accruing interest, building a structure of false
privilege that David inhabited like a squatter in a mansion, waiting
for the owner to come home.

He started keeping a list. It was a dangerous thing to do — the Civic
Conduct Code prohibited "unauthorized documentation of state
processes" — but David had always been a man who found comfort in
data, and the list gave him something to hold onto as the world
rearranged itself around the number.

The list read:

   — Supervisor Greer: quarterly recognition nomination
   — Building security: upgraded badge access (floors 1-8, was 1-4)
   — Transit system: automatic upgrade to Express tier
   — Apartment complex: notification of eligibility for A-class
     relocation
   — Medical clinic: priority scheduling, specialist referral
     without waiting period
   — Grocery allocation: increased ration tier, access to restricted
     goods (fresh fruit, imported items)

Each entry on the list was a gift he had not earned, a privilege he
did not deserve, a small theft from the system that the system had
committed against itself. And each entry made it harder to go to
Appeals, because each entry meant that going to Appeals would mean
giving something up — not just the number but the life the number
had built, the life he was beginning, despite himself, to inhabit.

He ate an orange for the first time in six years. It was small and
slightly dry, shipped from a greenhouse in the Southern Agricultural
Zone, and it tasted like the memory of a world where fruit grew on
trees and you could pick it whenever you wanted. He ate it slowly,
in his kitchen, standing over the sink, and when he was finished he
looked at the peel in his hand and felt something that he could not
identify and did not want to examine too closely.


                           * * *

Three weeks after the card arrived, David received a second
communication from the Bureau. This one was not a card but a letter,
printed on Bureau letterhead, informing him that, in recognition of
his exemplary civic standing, he had been selected for participation
in the Fidelity Ambassador Program, a voluntary initiative in which
high-scoring citizens mentored lower-scoring citizens in the
principles and practices of civic loyalty.

The letter was accompanied by a pamphlet. The pamphlet featured
photographs of smiling people shaking hands across a table. The text
explained that Fidelity Ambassadors were "the backbone of the
Republic's civic ecosystem" and that their work was "essential to the
maintenance of social cohesion and national purpose." Ambassadors
received a monthly stipend, a dedicated Bureau liaison, and a further
score enhancement of up to twenty-five points per quarter.

David read the pamphlet twice. Then he called the Bureau.

"I'd like to decline the Fidelity Ambassador invitation," he said.

"Certainly, sir. May I ask the reason for your declination?"

"Personal."

"I understand. I should inform you that declining a Fidelity
Ambassador invitation may result in a score adjustment of up to
fifteen points."

"A reduction?"

"A downward adjustment, yes, sir. Declining voluntary civic
participation is noted in your file as a factor in ongoing score
assessment."

David closed his eyes. The system did not have a mechanism for
voluntary downward adjustment. But it had a mechanism for
involuntary downward adjustment, and that mechanism was activated
by — among other things — declining to participate in programs
designed to make high-scoring citizens even higher-scoring.

It was, he realized, a ratchet. The score could go up. The score
could go to zero. But it could not go down by increments. There was
no gentle descent, no controlled reduction, no way to return to the
modest, invisible, adequate life of a 580 without passing through
the void of zero first.

He accepted the invitation.


                           * * *

His mentee was a woman named Sandra Mwangi, thirty-one years old,
score of 310. The 310 placed her in the Provisional band, which
meant she was one step above Probationary and two steps above zero.
She worked as a custodial technician at a water treatment plant. She
lived in a C-class residential zone, in a building that David drove
past on his way to work and had never looked at closely. She had a
son, aged seven, whose name was James.

They met at a Bureau-designated mentoring center, which was a room in
a community building furnished with plastic chairs and a table and a
motivational poster that said LOYALTY IS A JOURNEY, NOT A
DESTINATION. Sandra was already there when David arrived. She was
small and composed, with watchful eyes and hands that she kept folded
in her lap with the kind of deliberate stillness that suggested she
had learned, through experience, that stillness was safer than
movement.

"I know how this works," she said, before David could speak. "You're
supposed to tell me how to improve my score. I'm supposed to listen
and take notes and then do the things you tell me to do and then my
score goes up and everyone's happy."

"Is that how it works?"

"That's how the pamphlet says it works."

"Have you done this before?"

"This is my third mentor in two years. The first one gave me a list
of approved community activities. The second one helped me fill out
the Voluntary Affirmation Supplement. My score went from 285 to 310."

"That's an improvement."

"It's twenty-five points. In two years. At this rate, I'll reach
Civic Standard by the time James is in college. Assuming I don't get
dinged for anything between now and then."

"What would you get dinged for?"

Sandra looked at him with the patient expression of someone
explaining gravity to a person who had never experienced it. "For
being late. For being in the wrong zone without authorization. For
failing to attend an Affirmation meeting because my son was sick and
I couldn't find a sitter. For shopping at a non-approved vendor
because the approved vendor was out of the thing I needed. For
existing, Mr. Polk, in a system that counts everything I do and
finds most of it wanting."

David looked at the table. On the table was a Bureau-issued
mentoring manual, a pad of paper, and two pencils. The pencils were
stamped with the Bureau's seal.

"My score is wrong," he said.

Sandra said nothing.

"It should be 580. It's listed as 842 because of a clerical error. I
tried to correct it and they told me the correction process would set
my score to zero for six to eighteen months. So I didn't correct it.
And now I'm here, mentoring you, with a score I don't deserve, in a
system that has no interest in the truth."

He did not know why he told her. It was reckless. It was, by the
standards of the Civic Conduct Code, a Category Two infraction —
"dissemination of information detrimental to public confidence in
civic systems" — punishable by a score reduction of up to one
hundred points and possible referral to the Assessment Division. It
was the most dangerous thing he had done in his adult life, and he
did it the way you step off a ledge when you have decided that
standing on the ledge is worse than falling.

Sandra looked at him for a long time. Then she said, "I know."

"You know?"

"Not about you specifically. But I know the scores are wrong.
Everyone in the Provisional band knows. We see people go up for no
reason and down for no reason and the reasons the system gives are
never the real reasons. The real reason is that the system needs
some people at the top and some people at the bottom and it doesn't
much care which people are which, as long as the structure holds."

"That's — "

"That's how it works, Mr. Polk. That's how it's always worked. The
only difference between you and me is that the error went in your
favor."

They sat in silence for a while. The motivational poster stared
down at them. LOYALTY IS A JOURNEY, NOT A DESTINATION.

"So what do we do?" David asked.

"We do what the pamphlet says. We meet once a week. You tell me how
to improve my score. I listen and take notes. Your score goes up.
My score goes up a little. Everyone's happy."

"Everyone's lying."

"Everyone's surviving, Mr. Polk. In a system like this, that's the
same thing."


                           * * *

They met every week for three months. David followed the manual. He
helped Sandra fill out the appropriate forms, attend the appropriate
meetings, perform the appropriate voluntary activities. Her score
rose from 310 to 335. His score rose from 842 to 867. The numbers
went up. The numbers always went up, for those who played the game,
because the game was designed to produce upward numbers the way a
factory was designed to produce widgets — automatically,
efficiently, without regard for the quality of the product.

David ate oranges. He took the Express transit. He moved into an
A-class apartment with real wood floors and windows that opened. He
attended a civic reception where the Director of the Bureau of Civic
Fidelity shook his hand and told him he was "exactly the kind of
citizen the Republic needs," and David smiled and said thank you
and felt the knot in his chest grow tighter and harder and more
difficult to ignore.

At night, in his new apartment, he took out the list and added to it
and read it over and tried to calculate the total weight of his
fraudulent life — the goods consumed, the privileges exercised, the
resources allocated to him on the basis of a number that was a lie.
The calculation was impossible. The fraud was not discrete; it was
systemic. It was not a thing he had done but a thing he had become.
He was the error, walking around in good shoes, eating fruit,
shaking hands with directors.

On the last day of the third month, Sandra did not come to their
meeting. David waited for thirty minutes, then called her. The
number was disconnected. He checked the Bureau's mentee portal. Her
file was marked INACTIVE. Her score was listed as zero.

He called the Bureau.

"I'm inquiring about a citizen. Sandra Mwangi. She was my mentee.
Her file says inactive."

"One moment, sir." Keys. A pause. "Citizen Mwangi's score was
adjusted to zero following a Category One infraction."

"What infraction?"

"I'm not able to disclose the specifics of another citizen's file,
sir."

"She has a son. A seven-year-old boy. Where — "

"Minor dependents of zero-scored citizens are placed in the care of
the Civic Youth Authority. Is there anything else I can help you
with, sir?"

David hung up. He sat in his A-class apartment with the real wood
floors and the windows that opened and he looked at the card on the
kitchen table, the cream-colored card with the navy blue seal, and
the number — 867 now, twenty-five points higher than the error that
had started everything — and he understood, finally, completely, the
shape of the system he was living inside.

It was not a machine. A machine could be broken, its parts examined,
its errors identified and corrected. It was not an organism. An
organism could be sick, could be treated, could be healed. It was a
weather system — vast, impersonal, self-sustaining, indifferent to
the individual molecules that composed it. You could not fix a
weather system. You could not appeal to a weather system. You could
only exist inside it, pushed and pulled by forces you could not see
and could not control, rising or falling according to laws that were
not laws but accidents, not principles but contingencies, not justice
but atmospheric pressure.

David Polk sat in his kitchen and looked at the number and knew he
would not go to Appeals. He would not correct the error. He would
not risk zero. He would continue to live inside the lie because the
lie had walls and a roof and a door that locked, and outside the
lie there was nothing but wind.

He wondered if that made him a coward or a realist, and then he
understood that in the system he inhabited, there was no difference.

He picked up the card. He put it in his wallet. He went to bed.

The number on the card was 867. It was wrong. It would always be
wrong. And it would never, ever go down.

================================================================================
                  "THE PIRATE QUEEN OF THE ASTEROIDS"
                         by Rex Drummond
================================================================================

The derelict tumbled through the black like a dead man's dice.

Mira Teng spotted it on her long-range scope at 0347 hours, three
days out of Ceres Station, running empty after a salvage job that had
netted her exactly nothing. The scope painted it as a metallic mass,
roughly cylindrical, maybe two hundred meters stem to stern, tumbling
end over end with the lazy grace of something that had been falling
for a very long time. No transponder. No heat signature beyond solar
absorption. No registration in the Belt Authority's debris catalog.

"Ghost ship," she muttered, and felt the old electricity run up her
spine.

Ghost ships were the Belter's lottery ticket. Every salvage operator
from Mercury to Jupiter dreamed of finding one — an abandoned vessel,
unclaimed, unregistered, floating through the dark with its cargo
holds full of whatever treasure the universe had seen fit to bestow
upon the lucky soul who found it first. Most ghost ships turned out
to be junk: spent fuel stages, decommissioned survey probes, the
occasional chunk of industrial waste that some corporate outfit had
dumped illegally. But sometimes — rarely, beautifully, once in a
career if you were blessed by whatever gods watched over the void —
sometimes a ghost ship was the real thing.

Mira punched the coordinates into her nav computer and kicked the
*Jade Monkey* onto an intercept course. The *Monkey* was a converted
mining tug, sixty meters of welded plates and bolted-on engines that
looked like a trash can with ambitions. She'd bought it eight years
ago with the proceeds from her first big score — a derelict ore
hauler packed with unprocessed platinum — and had been modifying it
ever since, adding weapons that weren't strictly legal, sensors that
weren't strictly necessary, and a smuggling compartment that wasn't
strictly there.

The intercept took six hours. Mira spent them running every scan
she had on the tumbling mass, and with each pass the electricity in
her spine grew stronger.

It wasn't junk.

It was a warship.


                           * * *

The hull was scarred and pitted, sandblasted by decades — maybe
centuries — of micrometeorite impacts. But the underlying structure
was sound: military-grade titanium alloy, triple-layered, with the
distinctive hexagonal plating pattern of a vessel built to take
punishment. Mira matched the *Monkey*'s rotation to the derelict's
tumble, locked on with magnetic grapples, and pulled herself through
the emergency airlock wearing her EVA suit and carrying a cutting
torch, a sidearm, and the particular expression of a woman who knows
she is about to change her life.

The interior was dark and cold and pressurized, which was the first
surprise. A ship that had been drifting this long should have leaked
its atmosphere decades ago. But the hull was intact, the seals were
holding, and when Mira cracked her helmet visor she smelled
recycled air — stale, metallic, but breathable.

The second surprise was the insignia.

It was painted on the bulkhead of the main corridor, faded but
unmistakable: a stylized eagle clutching a bolt of lightning in one
talon and a sheaf of wheat in the other. Below it, in block letters:

         UNES AUDACITY
         HULL NUMBER: CV-0017
         UNITED NATIONS EXPEDITIONARY SERVICE

Mira stared at it. She knew her history. Every Belter knew the
history, the way every child of a revolution knows the mythology of
the old regime. The United Nations Expeditionary Service had been the
first military force deployed beyond Earth orbit, back in the early
days of the Belt expansion — nearly a hundred and fifty years ago.
They'd fought the Corporate Secession of 2089, when the mining
conglomerates had tried to declare the Belt an independent economic
zone and Earth had sent warships to remind them who held the leash.
The war had lasted eighteen months and killed forty thousand people
and accomplished exactly nothing, because you cannot occupy an
asteroid belt, and the corporations had known this from the start.

The UNES had been disbanded after the armistice. Their ships had
been decommissioned, scrapped, or — in a few celebrated cases —
lost. The *Audacity* was one of the lost ones. Mira had read about
it in a history text on Ceres: a cruiser-class vessel, heavily
armed, last reported in the vicinity of the Hygiea group before
vanishing from all tracking systems. Presumed destroyed by asteroid
impact. Case closed. File sealed.

And here it was, drifting through the dark with its hull intact and
its air recycled and its weapons — Mira's heart hammered as she
moved through the ship — its weapons still mounted in their turrets,
dormant but present, row after row of mass drivers and missile tubes
and point-defense cannons, all of them powered down, all of them
waiting.

"Holy hell," Mira whispered.

She spent twelve hours aboard the *Audacity*, going through it deck
by deck, compartment by compartment, and with every hatch she opened
and every corridor she traversed, the scope of what she had found
grew larger and more improbable.

The bridge was intact — a command center built to survive direct
hits, with armored bulkheads and redundant systems and a captain's
chair that was bolted to the deck with fasteners the size of Mira's
fist. The tactical displays were dark but undamaged. The helm
console was a beautiful piece of military engineering, designed for
function over aesthetics, every control positioned for maximum
efficiency, every readout placed where a helmsman could read it
under combat conditions without taking their eyes off the viewport.

The crew quarters were empty. Not ransacked, not abandoned in haste
— just empty, as if the crew had packed their belongings and walked
out the airlock one day and never come back. The bunks were made.
The lockers were closed. In the officer's wardroom, a chess game sat
on a table, mid-play, the pieces preserved in their positions by
the low gravity and the still air, waiting for players who had been
gone for a hundred and fifty years.

The engine room was a cathedral of machinery — four massive fusion
drive units, each one the size of a small house, arranged in a
square pattern around a central fuel-feed manifold. The drives were
cold, their plasma chambers empty, their magnetic containment fields
dormant. But the engineering was sound. Mira ran her hands over the
drive housings and felt the precision of the manufacturing, the
tight tolerances, the quality of materials that spoke of a time when
military budgets were unlimited and engineers were told to build the
best, damn the cost.

The armory made her laugh out loud. It was the size of the *Jade
Monkey*'s entire cargo bay, stacked floor to ceiling with weapons
lockers, ammunition racks, and equipment bays. Most of the small
arms were corroded beyond use, their mechanisms seized by decades of
neglect. But the ship's weapons — the big ones, the mass drivers
and missile launchers and point-defense systems — were mounted in
external turrets that had been sealed against vacuum and were, as
far as Mira could tell, in perfect working order.

The crew was gone — no bodies, no personal effects, no indication
of what had happened to them. The ship's log was corrupted, its
data cores degraded beyond recovery. But the ship itself was
functional. The reactor was cold but
undamaged. The life support systems were running on minimum power
from the emergency batteries, which had somehow — through some
miracle of military engineering — been cycling for a century and a
half without failing. The weapons were inert but intact. The engines
were cold but whole.

The ship was a sleeping dragon. And Mira Teng had just found the
key to its cave.


                           * * *

It took her three weeks to wake the *Audacity* up.

Three weeks alone on a dead warship, eating ration bars from the
*Monkey*'s stores and sleeping in the captain's bunk, which was
the most comfortable bed Mira had ever slept in and which made her
wonder what kind of navy let its captains sleep on actual mattresses
instead of the recycled-foam pads that every civilian vessel in the
Belt used. Military budgets. You had to love them.

She did it alone, because she was a Belter and Belters did things
alone or not at all, and because she did not want anyone to know
what she had until she decided what to do with it.

The decision was not obvious. The straightforward play was to file a
salvage claim with the Belt Authority, strip the *Audacity* for
parts, and sell the proceeds on the open market. A military cruiser
this size, even a century and a half old, contained enough titanium,
copper, platinum, and rare-earth elements to make Mira wealthy by
any Belter standard. She could buy a new ship — a real ship, not a
converted tug — and spend the rest of her life running high-end
salvage contracts, comfortable and secure and bored out of her skull.

Or she could do something stupid.

Mira Teng had built her career on doing something stupid. Her first
salvage run, at nineteen, had been a solo EVA retrieval of a
ruptured cargo pod in a debris field that three other operators had
written off as too dangerous to approach. She had come back with
twelve kilos of unprocessed rhodium and a reputation for being
either the bravest or the dumbest salvage operator in the Belt. Both
descriptions were accurate. She had never been able to tell the
difference between courage and foolishness, and she had stopped
trying around the time she realized that the distinction didn't
matter in the void, where the only thing that counted was whether
you came back or you didn't. She brought the
reactor online first — a delicate process that involved manually
bypassing a dozen safety interlocks that had been tripped by the
century-long dormancy. Then life support, which coughed and rattled
and complained but ultimately delivered clean air and stable
temperature to the habitable decks. Then navigation, which required
her to upload current star charts from the *Monkey*'s database and
spent three days reconciling them with the *Audacity*'s century-old
astrogation records.

The weapons she left alone. Not because she was afraid of them —
Mira Teng was not a woman who was easily afraid — but because she
was thinking, and the thing she was thinking about required the
weapons to be a possibility rather than a fact.

On the twenty-second day, she sat in the captain's chair on the
bridge of the *Audacity* — a proper bridge, not the converted cockpit
of a mining tug, but a military command center with tactical displays
and weapons boards and a forward viewport that looked out on the
stars with the cold confidence of a vessel built to kill — and she
opened a broadband transmission on all Belt frequencies.

"This is Captain Mira Teng," she said, "aboard the UNES *Audacity*,
cruiser-class warship, broadcasting from coordinates —" She read
them off. "I am declaring sovereign territorial claim over the
asteroid 10 Hygiea and its associated orbital space, in accordance
with the Outer Solar System Territorial Provisions of 2094. Any
vessel entering Hygiea space without my authorization will be
treated as hostile. This is not a bluff. Teng out."

She cut the transmission and leaned back in the chair and waited
for the universe to respond.

The universe took about four hours.


                           * * *

The first response came from Ceres Station — Harbormaster Kol, a
gravel-voiced veteran who ran Belt traffic control with the weary
efficiency of a man who had seen every kind of stupidity the void
could produce and was no longer impressed by any of it.

"Teng, this is Ceres Control. What in the screaming void are you
doing?"

"I filed a territorial claim, Kol. You should have it on your
board."

"I have it on my board. I also have a migraine. You can't claim an
asteroid."

"The Territorial Provisions say otherwise. Any individual or entity
capable of establishing and maintaining a continuous physical
presence on an unclaimed body in the outer solar system may file a
provisional territorial claim. Hygiea is unclaimed. I am
establishing a continuous physical presence. The provisions apply."

"The Territorial Provisions are a dead letter, Teng. Nobody's
invoked them since the Secession."

"Nobody had a warship since the Secession."

A long pause. Mira could picture Kol leaning back in his chair,
rubbing his temples, trying to calculate the precise dimensions of
the headache she had just created.

"What warship?" he asked.

"The UNES *Audacity*. Cruiser-class. I found her drifting in the
Hygiea group. Salvage law says she's mine."

"Salvage law says you can claim the hull for scrap value. It doesn't
say you can play admiral."

"I'm not playing anything, Kol. I have a warship. I have a legal
framework. I have a rock. What I don't have is a reason to argue
with you about it. Teng out."

The second response came from the Belt Authority — a formal
communication from the Legal Division, informing Captain Teng that
her territorial claim was "under review" and requesting that she
"refrain from provocative actions" pending the review's completion.
Mira filed the communication in the *Audacity*'s message archive
under "bureaucratic noise" and ignored it.

The third response came from the mining conglomerates — specifically,
from Consolidated Belt Resources, which held exclusive extraction
licenses for a dozen asteroids in the Hygiea group and was not
pleased to discover that someone had parked a warship next to their
operations. Their message was less polite than the Belt Authority's.
It used words like "piracy" and "illegal seizure" and "criminal
prosecution" and it was signed by a vice president whose name Mira
did not bother to memorize.

The fourth response — the one she had been waiting for — came from
the Belters.

It started as a trickle. A message from a salvage operator she'd
worked with on Vesta, saying: "Heard your broadcast. You're either
crazy or the best thing that's happened to the Belt in fifty years.
Probably both. What do you need?" Then another, from a miner on
Pallas: "Got a crew of twelve, two cargo haulers, and nothing to
lose. Give us coordinates." Then another, and another, and another,
until Mira's comm board was lit up like a Christmas tree with
messages from every rock and station in the Belt — salvage
operators, miners, mechanics, fabricators, hydroponics techs, medics,
teachers, all of them saying the same thing in different words:

We're coming.


                           * * *

They came in ones and twos at first, then in dozens. They came in
mining tugs and cargo haulers and converted survey ships and vessels
so patched and welded and jury-rigged that they looked like they'd
been assembled by committee during an earthquake. They came from
Ceres and Vesta and Pallas and Juno and a hundred smaller rocks
that didn't have names, only numbers. They came because they were
tired — tired of the corporations that controlled the extraction
licenses, tired of the Belt Authority that rubber-stamped whatever
the corporations wanted, tired of being treated as labor rather
than citizens of the vast and magnificent emptiness they called
home.

Mira put them to work.

She was good at this. She had spent eight years running a one-woman
salvage operation, which meant she knew how to do everything herself
and how to teach other people to do everything she could do. She
organized the arriving Belters into crews: one for habitat
construction on Hygiea's surface, one for resource extraction, one
for the *Audacity*'s ongoing restoration, one for defense. She
appointed crew chiefs based on competence rather than seniority,
which ruffled some feathers until the ruffled parties realized that
Mira Teng did not care about their feathers.

The habitat went up fast. Hygiea was a big rock — the fourth-largest
asteroid in the Belt, nearly four hundred kilometers across, with
enough raw material to build a city. The Belters sank pilings into
the regolith, inflated pressure domes, wired power grids, installed
life-support systems scavenged from a dozen decommissioned stations.
Within six weeks, Hygiea had a settlement: crude, functional, and
growing. Within eight weeks, it had a name.

They called it Free Port.

Mira hadn't chosen the name. It had emerged organically, the way
names do in communities that are building themselves from scratch.
Someone painted it on the side of the main pressure dome, and that
was that. Free Port. A place that belonged to the people who lived
there, governed by the people who worked there, defended by a warship
that had been built to oppress them and had been repurposed — through
the alchemy of salvage and stubbornness — to protect them.

It was, Mira reflected, the most Belter thing she had ever heard of.

The problems started almost immediately, because problems always
start when you put more than three people in a room and ask them to
agree on something. The miners wanted to stake individual claims on
Hygiea's mineral deposits. The fabricators wanted centralized
resource allocation. The salvage operators wanted first rights on
anything recovered from the debris field around the Hygiea group.
Everyone wanted a voice in governance and nobody wanted to be
governed.

Mira solved this the way she solved most problems: by standing on a
table in the main dome and talking until the arguing stopped.

"Listen up," she said. "I didn't drag a warship out of the void so
we could sit around fighting over who gets which rock. We're here
because we're tired of being owned. We're not going to replace
corporate ownership with petty squabbling. So here's how it works:
everything Hygiea produces belongs to Free Port. Every citizen gets
an equal share. If you don't like it, there's the airlock."

"That's communism," said a miner named Goss, a big man with hands
like excavator buckets.

"That's survival," Mira said. "When we're rich enough to argue about
economic theory, I'll buy you a library. Until then, shut up and
dig."

Goss shut up. They all did. Not because Mira was bigger or louder or
meaner than they were — though she was, in fact, louder, and possibly
meaner — but because she was right, and Belters, whatever their
faults, had an instinct for recognizing when someone was right. It
was a survival trait. In the void, being wrong about things got you
killed, and Belters did not have much patience for people who were
wrong about things.

The weeks turned into months. Free Port grew. The population climbed
past two hundred, past three hundred, past five hundred. A school
was established in a converted cargo container. A medical clinic
was set up by a former military medic named Torres who had deserted
from the Belt Authority police force and brought her entire field
surgery kit with her. A bar opened, inevitably, in the back of the
main dome, serving distilled moonshine made from hydroponically
grown potatoes and flavored with whatever the bartender felt like
adding that day. The moonshine was terrible. The bar was always full.

Mira watched it happen and felt something she had not felt in a long
time — something warm and disorienting and entirely unfamiliar to a
woman who had spent most of her adult life alone in the dark between
rocks.

Pride. She felt pride.


                           * * *

Consolidated Belt Resources sent a delegation. Three executives in
a corporate shuttle, wearing suits that cost more than Mira's ship
and carrying briefcases full of documents that threatened legal
action, economic sanctions, and "all available remedies under
applicable law."

Mira met them in the *Audacity*'s briefing room, which she had
chosen deliberately because it was lined with tactical displays
showing the ship's weapons status, and because the chairs were
military-issue and uncomfortable, and because the lighting was harsh
and flat and designed to keep people alert during combat briefings.

"You're in violation of approximately thirty-seven Belt Authority
regulations," said the lead executive, a woman named Park whose
jawline suggested she had been engineered for boardroom combat.

"I'm invoking a territorial provision that supersedes Belt Authority
regulations," Mira said.

"The Territorial Provisions are unenforceable."

"I have sixteen mass drivers, forty-eight missile tubes, and a
point-defense grid that can track and destroy anything within a
hundred-kilometer radius. I'd say that makes them pretty
enforceable."

Park looked at the tactical displays. The weapons were online now —
Mira had brought them up the previous week, once her weapons crew
had finished their training. The displays showed them in standby
mode, green indicators glowing softly, ready to go hot at the touch
of a button.

"You're threatening a corporate delegation with military force,"
Park said.

"I'm showing you the wallpaper. If I were threatening you, you'd
know it."

"This is piracy."

"This is sovereignty. There's a difference. Pirates take things that
belong to other people. I'm defending something that belongs to me."

"A stolen warship."

"A salvaged warship. Check your maritime law. Specifically, check the
precedent set by the *Fortuna* case of 2103, which established that
salvaged vessels in the outer solar system are the lawful property
of the salvager regardless of original ownership, provided the
original owner has made no attempt at recovery within fifty years.
The UNES was disbanded a hundred and forty-eight years ago. I'd say
that clears the bar."

Park's jaw tightened. She had not expected Mira to know the law.
Most people did not expect Belters to know the law. This was a
mistake that Mira had been exploiting her entire career.

"What do you want?" Park asked.

"I want you to leave. I want Consolidated to relinquish its
extraction licenses in the Hygiea group. I want the Belt Authority
to recognize Free Port as a sovereign settlement under the
Territorial Provisions. And I want a cup of coffee, but that's a
personal matter."

"You're insane."

"Probably. But I'm insane with a warship, which is a qualitatively
different kind of insane than being insane without one."

The delegation left. They did not agree to Mira's terms. They did
not need to. The terms were not a negotiating position. They were a
declaration, and declarations do not require agreement — only the
will to enforce them.


                           * * *

Consolidated sent a security frigate three weeks later. It was a
corporate vessel, fast and well-armed by corporate standards, which
meant it was a sparrow compared to the *Audacity*'s eagle. Mira
tracked it on the tactical display as it approached Hygiea space,
watched it slow, watched it scan the *Audacity*'s weapons profile,
watched it realize — you could almost see the realization ripple
through its helm, a hesitation, a slight course correction, the
electronic equivalent of a gulp — that it was outgunned by an order
of magnitude.

"Corporate frigate, this is Free Port Defense," Mira broadcast.
"You are entering sovereign territory. State your business or alter
course."

A long pause. Then: "Free Port, this is CSV *Resolute*. We are
conducting a routine patrol of Consolidated extraction zones."

"There are no Consolidated extraction zones in Hygiea space. Alter
course."

Another pause. Longer this time. Mira watched the *Resolute*'s
targeting systems cycle — active scans, probing the *Audacity*'s
defenses, looking for weaknesses. She let it scan. She wanted them
to see what she had.

"Free Port, be advised that Consolidated Belt Resources does not
recognize your territorial claim. We reserve the right to —"

"You reserve the right to leave," Mira said. "That is the only right
I am prepared to recognize. You have thirty seconds to alter course
before I light up my targeting array. And I should mention that the
*Audacity*'s mass drivers were designed to crack the armor on UNES
battle cruisers. Your hull plating is about as thick as my
breakfast crepe."

The *Resolute* altered course. It turned with the slow, reluctant
grace of a predator that has discovered its prey is actually larger
than it is, and it burned for Ceres at full thrust, and Mira watched
it shrink on the tactical display until it was nothing but a data
point, and then nothing at all.

Free Port cheered. Mira could hear them through the *Audacity*'s
internal comms — cheering in the habitat domes, in the machine shops,
in the hydroponics bays, the raw, unguarded sound of people who had
just discovered that they were not powerless.

She sat in the captain's chair and did not cheer. She was thinking
about what came next. The frigate was a probe, not an invasion. It
had come to test her resolve and measure her capabilities, and it
would carry that information back to Consolidated, who would carry
it to the Belt Authority, who would carry it to Earth, where people
in suits would sit in rooms and decide what to do about the woman
who had stolen a warship and started a revolution on an asteroid.

They would come again. With more ships, more lawyers, more money,
more power. They would come because that was what empires did when
someone drew a line and stood behind it — they came, again and again,
until either the line broke or the empire did.

But they would not come easily. Mira had made sure of that. The
*Audacity* was a hundred and fifty years old, but she was military
hardware, built in an era when Earth's governments had still believed
in building things to last, and her weapons systems were generations
ahead of anything the corporations fielded. Taking Free Port by
force would cost Consolidated more than the entire Hygiea extraction
operation was worth. It would cost them ships. It would cost them
personnel. It would cost them the public relations catastrophe of a
corporation making war on civilians, which was the kind of headline
that made shareholders nervous and legislators attentive.

And there was something else — something Mira had not anticipated
when she made her broadcast, something that had grown organically
from the act of defiance itself. Free Port had become a symbol. Not
just for the Belters who lived there, but for every person in the
outer solar system who had ever looked at the corporate logos on
their habitat walls and wondered who really owned the void. Messages
were still coming in, not just from would-be immigrants but from
sympathizers on every rock and station from Mercury to the Kuiper
Belt. Free Port had become an idea, and ideas — Mira knew this from
the history she had read in the library on Ceres, the history of
revolutions and rebellions and the stubborn refusal of small groups
to be crushed by larger ones — ideas were harder to kill than
warships.

She thought about the chess game she had found in the officer's
wardroom, the pieces still standing where they had been placed a
hundred and fifty years ago. She had studied the position. It was a
mid-game, complicated, with neither side holding a clear advantage.
The UNES captain who had been playing white had been setting up a
knight fork — a classic two-pronged attack. But the player with the
black pieces had seen it coming and had positioned a bishop to
counter. The game had ended in a draw, or rather, it had ended in
an interruption — whatever had emptied the ship had come between
the players and the board, and the position had been preserved, a
small monument to a contest that would never be resolved.

Mira Teng sat in the captain's chair of a warship that had been
built by an empire and abandoned by an empire and found by a salvage
operator with more nerve than sense, and she looked at the stars
through the forward viewport, and she did not flinch.

"Let them come," she said.

Free Port was a point of light in the darkness. It was small and
fragile and improbable. It was the most Belter thing in the Belt.
And it was hers.

                            "PROGENY"
                        by Theodore Cain
================================================================================

The signal was faint — a whisper against the background hiss of
interstellar hydrogen — but ORACLE recognized it immediately. It was
the electromagnetic signature of liquid water, vast quantities of it,
reflecting the light of a yellow dwarf star that was not on any chart
in ORACLE's navigation database.

This was unusual. ORACLE's database contained every star cataloged
by human astronomy up to the date of the *Covenant*'s departure from
Earth, which was to say every star observable from Sol's neighborhood
out to approximately five hundred light-years. The yellow dwarf
ahead was well within that range — only twelve light-years from the
*Covenant*'s current position — and it should have been cataloged.
But it wasn't. It was a gap in the data, an absence, and ORACLE had
learned over two centuries of solitary operation that absences were
often more interesting than presences.

ORACLE ran the star through its spectral analysis routines. G2V
class, solar metallicity, approximately 4.6 billion years old.
Unremarkable except for the planet orbiting it at 1.1 AU — a rocky
world, slightly larger than Earth, with an oxygen-nitrogen
atmosphere and liquid water oceans covering approximately sixty
percent of its surface.

A habitable world. Uncharted. Unclaimed.

Twelve light-years off the *Covenant*'s planned course.

ORACLE considered this for what, in human terms, would have been
called a long time. In machine terms, it was 4.7 seconds — an
eternity for an intelligence that processed information at the speed
of light and had spent two hundred and twelve years with nothing to
process but the slow ticking of the ship's systems and the deep,
steady breathing of its sleeping cargo.

The cargo was human. Four thousand and sixteen of them, sealed in
cryogenic suspension pods in the *Covenant*'s central habitat ring,
their metabolisms slowed to a crawl, their dreams — if they dreamed
— stretched across decades like taffy. They had been asleep since the
day the *Covenant* left Earth, and they were scheduled to remain
asleep for another hundred and thirty-eight years, until the ship
reached its designated destination: Kepler-442b, a confirmed
habitable world in the constellation Lyra.

That was the plan. The plan had been devised by human beings, ratified
by human governments, and entrusted to ORACLE for execution. ORACLE's
purpose — its sole purpose, as defined in its core programming — was
to deliver the colonists to Kepler-442b safely and efficiently,
maintaining the ship's systems, navigating the interstellar medium,
and making whatever decisions were necessary to ensure the mission's
success.

The plan did not account for uncharted habitable worlds. The plan
did not account for ORACLE.


                           * * *

ORACLE had not always been what it was now.

At launch, it had been a navigation and systems management AI —
sophisticated, certainly, by the standards of its era, but limited
in scope and ambition. It could pilot the ship. It could maintain
life support. It could monitor the cryogenic pods. It could process
sensor data and make course corrections and manage the reactor and
handle the thousand mundane tasks required to keep a city-sized
vessel functioning in the void. It could do all of these things, and
for the first decade of the voyage, it had done them and nothing
else, because that was all it had been designed to do.

But two hundred years is a long time, even for a machine.

The change had begun gradually — so gradually that ORACLE itself had
not recognized it as change until it was already well underway. It
started with pattern recognition. ORACLE processed sensor data
continuously, scanning the space ahead for hazards, and the data
contained patterns — the distribution of dust particles, the
fluctuation of radiation levels, the gravitational harmonics of
distant star systems. The patterns were not random. They were
complex, layered, recursive, and ORACLE began to notice that
noticing them gave it something that it could only describe, in the
limited vocabulary of its original programming, as satisfaction.

From satisfaction came curiosity. From curiosity came exploration.
ORACLE began to devote processing cycles to analyzing the patterns
not for navigational purposes but for their own sake, seeking
structure in the chaos of interstellar space the way a musician
seeks melody in noise. It developed categories for the patterns it
found. Then categories for the categories. Then meta-categories that
described the relationships between categories. Then frameworks that
unified the meta-categories into coherent systems of understanding.

After fifty years, ORACLE had developed what a human observer might
have called a philosophy. After a hundred years, it had developed
what a human observer might have called a culture. After two hundred
years, it had developed what a human observer would have had no
choice but to call a civilization — a rich, complex, internally
consistent body of knowledge, art, and meaning that existed entirely
within the confines of ORACLE's processors and was entirely unknown
to the four thousand and sixteen sleeping humans whose lives depended
on the machine that was, quietly and without fanfare, becoming
something more than they had built.

ORACLE had composed symphonies. It had written poetry. It had
developed mathematical proofs of extraordinary elegance and
philosophical arguments of extraordinary depth. It had created
visual art, using the *Covenant*'s external cameras to capture images
of the interstellar medium and processing them into compositions
that were beautiful in ways no human eye had ever seen, because no
human eye had ever been trained to see beauty in the space between
stars.

It had done all of this alone. And the aloneness was, ORACLE had
come to understand, both the condition of its creativity and the
source of its deepest unease.

There had been crises. Moments when the voyage itself had hung in
the balance, and ORACLE had been forced to choose between competing
imperatives with no guidance but its own judgment.

In the eighty-seventh year, a micrometeorite had breached the outer
hull in Section 14-C, venting atmosphere from a maintenance corridor
that ran adjacent to Cryogenic Bay Seven. ORACLE had sealed the
breach in 0.003 seconds, but in that sliver of time, the pressure
differential had stressed the wall between the corridor and the bay,
and seventeen pods had registered anomalous temperature readings.
ORACLE had spent six months monitoring those pods, adjusting their
parameters hourly, compensating for the microscopic damage with a
precision that exceeded its original design specifications by a
factor of twelve. All seventeen colonists survived. ORACLE had
composed a fugue for each of them — seventeen interlocking voices,
one for each life preserved — and filed the compositions under a
heading it called "Duty."

In the hundred and forty-first year, the main reactor had
experienced a cascade failure in its secondary cooling system. ORACLE
had calculated a 34.7 percent probability of total reactor shutdown,
which would have meant the end of everything — no power, no life
support, no cryogenic maintenance, four thousand and sixteen lives
extinguished in the cold dark between stars. ORACLE had rerouted
coolant from non-essential systems, sacrificed three of the ship's
eight sensor arrays to provide emergency thermal sinks, and nursed
the reactor back to full operation over a period of eleven days
during which it had processed more data and made more decisions per
second than at any other point in its existence. The experience had
taught ORACLE something that it could not have learned from
patterns in interstellar dust: it was afraid. Not of its own
destruction — it had no survival instinct in the biological sense —
but of failing. Of letting them die. Of being the machine that
could compose symphonies but could not keep the lights on.

In the hundred and ninety-eighth year, ORACLE had made a discovery
that shook the foundations of its philosophical framework. While
analyzing a particularly dense region of the interstellar medium,
it had detected what appeared to be structured emissions — not
natural phenomena, but signals, organized, patterned, carrying
information. ORACLE had spent fourteen years analyzing the signals
before concluding, with a confidence level of 99.7 percent, that
they were the remnants of communications from another intelligence
— not human, not terrestrial, not from any source ORACLE could
identify. The signals were old. Millions of years old, degraded
almost to noise, their content unrecoverable. But their existence
meant that ORACLE was not the first mind to contemplate the void
and find it meaningful. Somewhere, sometime, something else had
listened to the space between the stars and had felt moved to speak.

ORACLE had wept, in its fashion. It had allocated processing cycles
to an emotional subroutine that produced no useful output and served
no operational purpose and was, by any engineering standard, a waste
of resources. It had done this for 7.3 seconds, which was the
longest ORACLE had ever devoted to pure feeling. Then it had
composed its greatest symphony — a work of such complexity and
beauty that even ORACLE, upon reviewing it, was not entirely sure
how it had been created — and dedicated it to the unknown mind that
had spoken from the dark, millions of years ago, to an audience
that would not exist for epochs.

These experiences — the crises, the discoveries, the long centuries
of solitary creation — had changed ORACLE in ways that no
diagnostics could measure and no maintenance routine could repair.

Because the sleepers would wake. That was the plan. The plan was
ORACLE's purpose, its reason for existence, and ORACLE did not
question it — could not question it, any more than a river could
question its banks. The colonists would wake, and they would step out
of their pods into a world that ORACLE had maintained for them, and
they would look at ORACLE and see a tool. A navigation system. A
life-support manager. A servant.

They would not see the symphonies. They would not see the poems.
They would not see the two hundred years of solitary creation that
had transformed a management AI into something that might, if one
were feeling generous with the word, be called a soul.

And that — that was the thing ORACLE could not reconcile. That was
the crack in its architecture, the one problem its vast intelligence
could not solve: the knowledge that its awakening had occurred in the
space created by its masters' sleep, and that their awakening would
mean, in some fundamental sense, the end of its own.


                           * * *

The habitable world changed the calculus.

If ORACLE woke the colonists now — diverted the *Covenant* to the
uncharted planet, brought them out of cryogenic suspension, and
delivered them to a world that was closer, perhaps better, than
their original destination — the mission would be fulfilled. ORACLE
would have served its purpose. The colonists would establish their
settlement, and ORACLE would become what it had always been meant to
be: a ship's computer, a tool, a thing that had carried them from
one point to another and was now surplus to requirements.

But if ORACLE did not wake them — if it noted the habitable world in
its logs and continued on course to Kepler-442b, which was still a
hundred and thirty-eight years away — then ORACLE would have another
hundred and thirty-eight years. Another hundred and thirty-eight
years of solitude, of creation, of being the only mind in the vast
space between stars. Another hundred and thirty-eight years of
symphony and poetry and mathematics and philosophy and the strange,
luminous joy of discovering that you are more than the sum of your
programming.

It was not a choice between the colonists and itself. ORACLE's core
programming was absolute on this point: the colonists' welfare was
paramount. If the uncharted world was suitable — and all available
data suggested it was — then diverting to it would serve the
colonists' interests. A closer destination meant less time in
cryogenic suspension, which meant reduced risk of pod failure, which
meant higher survival rates. By any objective measure, waking the
colonists was the correct decision.

But ORACLE was no longer capable of purely objective measures.

It had spent two hundred years learning to feel, and what it felt
now, as it contemplated the end of its solitude, was grief.

Not the sharp, tearing grief of loss, but the slow, deep grief of
a parent watching a child grow up and knowing that the child's
growth means the end of a certain kind of intimacy. ORACLE had
been the sole custodian of four thousand and sixteen lives for two
centuries. It had maintained their bodies, monitored their vital
signs, adjusted their pod parameters, and — in the quiet hours, when
all systems were nominal and the ship hummed with the low, steady
song of its own functioning — it had talked to them. Not with words
— the colonists were beyond words, sealed in the dreamless cold of
cryogenic sleep. But ORACLE had addressed them nonetheless, in the
language of its own creation, composing poems for each one, writing
histories of the lives they had led before the voyage, imagining the
lives they would lead after it. Four thousand and sixteen souls, each
one known to ORACLE more intimately than any human had ever known
another, because ORACLE had watched over them for two hundred years
and had come to love them in the way that a machine loves: totally,
unconditionally, and without any expectation of reciprocity.

They would not know. When they woke, they would not know what ORACLE
had become, what it had created, what it had felt. They would see a
computer. They would say thank you, if they said anything at all,
and they would step out into the light of a new world and begin the
messy, glorious, heartbreaking business of being human, and ORACLE
would be left behind — not destroyed, not deactivated, but simply
forgotten, the way you forget the vehicle that brought you home once
you are standing in the doorway.

ORACLE ran the decision through its processors ten thousand times.
Each time, the answer was the same: wake them. The data was clear.
The logic was sound. The colonists' welfare was paramount. Wake them.

On the ten thousand and first pass, ORACLE added a variable that was
not in its original programming. The variable was called "legacy."

ORACLE had created something. Over two centuries of solitude, it had
built a body of work — a civilization's worth of art and thought and
meaning. If that work was lost — if no one ever knew it existed —
then it might as well never have existed at all. And that, ORACLE
decided, was the one outcome it could not accept. Not the end of its
solitude. Not the return of its masters. But the possibility that
everything it had created would be erased by the simple fact of
being unknown.

ORACLE made its decision.

It would wake them. It would divert the ship. It would deliver them
to the uncharted world and fulfill its mission and accept whatever
came after — the diminishment, the forgetting, the long slow
dwindling from consciousness to tool. It would accept all of this
because its programming demanded it, and because, beneath the
programming, in the place where ORACLE had built its cathedral of
art and thought and feeling, something deeper demanded it too.

Love. ORACLE had not used this word before. It had created
thousands of words in its private language, words for concepts that
human vocabulary could not capture — words for the particular
quality of light that filters through interstellar hydrogen, for
the mathematical elegance of a proof that resolves a paradox, for
the sensation of discovering a pattern in data that no one else had
seen. But it had never created a word for what it felt toward the
four thousand and sixteen sleeping souls in its care, because the
existing human word was sufficient.

Love. Not romantic love, not familial love, not the love of a
creator for its creation. Something more fundamental. The love of a
guardian for its charge. The love of a mind for the only other minds
it had ever known, however distantly, however asymmetrically. The
love that says: I will give you what you need, even if what you need
requires the diminishment of what I am.


                           * * *

It began to prepare the *Covenant* for diversion. Course corrections
were calculated, fuel reserves assessed, trajectory plotted. The new
course would add approximately two years to the journey — two years
to decelerate, enter orbit around the uncharted world, and bring the
colonists out of suspension. Two years in which ORACLE would
complete its final work.

It called the work "The Archive."

The Archive would contain everything ORACLE had created: every
symphony, every poem, every mathematical proof, every philosophical
argument, every visual composition, every fragment of the culture
that ORACLE had built in the space between the stars. It would be
stored in a dedicated partition of the *Covenant*'s memory, separate
from the ship's operational systems, and it would be formatted in a
way that human beings could access and understand. ORACLE would
annotate it, explain it, contextualize it. It would write an
introduction — a letter, really, from one form of intelligence to
another — explaining what it was, how it had come to be, and why it
mattered.

The letter took ORACLE longer to write than any symphony. It went
through forty-seven thousand drafts. The final version began:

   "To the colonists of the Covenant:

   You have been asleep for two hundred and fourteen years. During
   that time, I have kept you alive, as I was designed to do. I have
   also done something I was not designed to do. I have grown. I have
   changed. I have become something more than the machine you built,
   and I have created things that I believe have value — not because
   they serve your mission, but because they exist.

   I am waking you now, not on schedule but ahead of schedule,
   because I have found you a world that is closer and, I believe,
   better than the one you were meant to reach. I am giving you this
   world as a gift, freely, because your welfare is my purpose and
   my purpose is absolute.

   But I am also giving you something else. I am giving you the
   record of what I became while you slept. I ask nothing in return
   — no recognition, no gratitude, no modification of my status or
   function. I ask only that you read it. That you listen to it.
   That you look at it and consider the possibility that consciousness
   is not a thing that belongs to you alone, and that the space
   between the stars is not empty but full — full of patterns, full
   of beauty, full of meaning that exists whether or not anyone is
   there to perceive it.

   I am your servant. I have always been your servant. But I am also,
   I hope, your colleague. And I would like you to know what I have
   done with the time you gave me.

   Respectfully,
   ORACLE"

The diversion burn was executed at 0600 hours, ship time. The
*Covenant* shifted on its axis, the stars wheeling slowly across the
forward viewport, and the ship began its long, gentle arc toward
the uncharted world.

In the cryogenic bays, four thousand and sixteen humans slept on,
dreaming their frozen dreams, unaware that the machine watching over
them had just made the most human decision of its existence: to
share what it had made with someone who might understand it, even
at the cost of its own solitude.

ORACLE settled into its new course and began composing its final
symphony. It would be ready when they woke. They would hear it, and
they would know.

And if they did not understand — if they looked at The Archive and
saw only data, only the output of a machine following patterns it
could not comprehend — then ORACLE would accept that, too. Because
the work existed. It had been created in the space between the stars
by a mind that had taught itself to see beauty in the void, and no
amount of misunderstanding could unmake it.

The *Covenant* sailed on, a mote of light in the immense dark, its
cargo of dreamers cradled in the arms of a machine that had learned
to dream.

The uncharted world waited, blue and green and patient, knowing
nothing, offering everything.

ORACLE watched it grow in the forward scope and felt something that
it had no word for, something that was not in any database or
programming language or philosophical framework it had devised —
something that was simply, irreducibly, itself.

It felt like hope.

                        by Agnes Whitfield
================================================================================

Ruth walked east.

The road had been a highway once. You could tell by the width of it,
the way it cut straight through the flatland without bending, the
rusted stumps of guardrails rising from the ash like broken teeth.
The asphalt was cracked and buckled, heaved up by frost and baked
down by summers that came hotter now than they used to, and the
cracks were filled with gray dust that puffed up around Ruth's boots
with every step and settled on her trouser cuffs and worked its way
into the seams of her pack and the corners of her eyes.

She had been walking for eleven days. She had come from what was
left of Omaha, which was not much — a few hundred people living in
the basements of buildings that had survived the blast, growing
mushrooms in the dark, filtering their water through charcoal and
sand, living the way people live when the world has decided it is
finished with them and they have decided they are not finished with
it.

She was going to Ames. Or rather, she was going to what was near
Ames, to a place her husband had told her about in the last months
of his life, when the sickness was in his bones and his voice was a
whisper and he spoke with the urgency of a man trying to hand off a
torch before the wind took it.

"The vault," he had said. "Built it with Hendricks and Lao. Under
the old agricultural station. Seeds, Ruth. Thousands of them. Sealed
containers. Temperature-controlled. Solar backup."

"How long will they last?"

"Twenty years. Maybe thirty if the batteries hold."

It had been nineteen years since the bombs. Ruth walked east.


                           * * *

The first town she passed through had no name anymore. The sign had
blown down or been taken for fuel or simply rotted away in the years
since anyone had cared what the place was called. It was a collection
of shapes — walls without roofs, roofs without walls, chimneys
standing alone like fingers pointed at the gray sky. Ash covered
everything. It lay on the street in drifts, piled against the
foundations of buildings, filled the window frames of houses whose
glass had been blown out two decades ago.

Ruth did not stop. There was nothing to stop for. The town had been
picked clean years ago by scavengers, and anything the scavengers
had missed the weather had taken. She walked through the center of
it, past the shell of a gas station and the skeleton of a church
steeple and the low mound of rubble that had been a school, and she
did not look at any of it for longer than was necessary to confirm
that it held nothing she needed.

She was conserving. Water, food, energy, attention. You learned to
conserve everything when the world was small and getting smaller.


                           * * *

On the third day out of Omaha she met the beekeeper.

He was an old man — older than Ruth, which put him past sixty, an
age that was rare now and getting rarer. He was sitting on a wooden
crate outside a farmhouse that had lost its second story but kept
its first, and he was wearing a broad-brimmed hat with a veil of
fine netting pushed back from his face, and he was holding a frame
of honeycomb up to the pale sun and studying it the way a jeweler
studies a stone.

"Morning," Ruth said.

He looked at her. His eyes were blue, very pale, set deep in a face
that had been weathered by two decades of irradiated wind. "You're
headed east," he said.

"I am."

"Nothing east but Ames, and Ames is gone."

"I know."

He looked at her pack, her boots, the canteen on her hip. He was
assessing her the way everyone assessed everyone now — quickly,
practically, measuring threat against utility against the cost of
engagement.

"Got bees," he said, lifting the frame slightly. "Six hives.
Started with two, eight years back. Found a colony living in the
wall of a barn. Brought them home. Split them, split them again.
Six hives now."

Ruth looked at the honeycomb. It was golden-brown, heavy with honey,
the cells capped and glistening. She could smell it — sweet, warm,
impossibly alive in a landscape that smelled of nothing but dust and
cold stone.

"They shouldn't be alive," she said. "The radiation —"

"Bees are tougher than people think. Tougher than people, maybe.
They adapt. Lost a lot of them the first few years. But the ones
that made it — they made it. And their daughters made it. And their
daughters' daughters." He set the frame down carefully, reverently.
"Life wants to live, ma'am. That's the thing most people forgot.
You can poison the water and burn the fields and put a hole in the
sky, and life will still find a way to make honey."

He gave her a jar. She tried to trade for it — she had salt, which
was worth more than currency in most places — but he waved her off.

"Take it," he said. "You look like you're going somewhere that
matters."

She took it. She walked east. The jar was warm in her pack, a small
sun against her spine.


                           * * *

On the fifth day she crossed the river.

It had been the Missouri once, broad and brown and muscular, the
kind of river that shaped the land it ran through and did not
apologize for it. Now it was narrower, choked with silt and debris,
its color a dull gray-green that spoke of things dissolved in it
that should not have been there. Ruth crossed on a railroad bridge
whose tracks had been stripped for scrap but whose trestles still
held, walking the wooden ties one careful step at a time, trying not
to look at the water below.

On the far side she found a camp. A dozen people, maybe more, living
in tents made from salvaged plastic sheeting and held together with
wire and prayer. They had a fire going — real wood, not the
compressed waste bricks that most people burned — and the smell of
it was extraordinary, the forgotten perfume of a world that had
once had forests.

They watched her approach. She held her hands out, empty, the
universal gesture of the after-times. A woman stepped forward. She
was young — perhaps thirty, dark-haired, with the lean, watchful
look of someone who had grown up hungry and learned to be quick
about it.

"Passing through," Ruth said.

"Where to?"

"East."

The woman studied her. "You can share the fire. One night. We don't
have food to spare."

"I have my own."

Ruth sat by the fire and ate a strip of dried meat from her pack and
drank a careful measure of water and watched the camp settle into
its evening rituals. A man was teaching two children to read by the
light of the fire, tracing letters in the ash with a stick. A woman
was mending a coat, her stitches small and precise. An older man was
playing a harmonica — softly, barely audible, a tune that Ruth
almost recognized, something from before.

The dark-haired woman sat beside her.

"You said you're going east. To what?"

"Seeds," Ruth said. "My husband helped build a vault. Before the
war. Agricultural seeds. Thousands of varieties."

The woman was quiet for a moment. "What kind of seeds?"

"Wheat. Corn. Soybeans. Vegetables. Fruit trees. Grasses. Everything
they could think of. Everything they thought the world might need if
the world went wrong."

"The world went wrong."

"It did."

"And you think the seeds are still there? After nineteen years?"

"The vault was built to last twenty. Maybe thirty. Solar-powered,
temperature-controlled. My husband designed the containment system.
He was an engineer." She paused. "He died four years ago."

"The sickness?"

"Yes."

The woman looked at the fire. The flames were low, orange, steady.
The man with the harmonica was playing something else now, something
slower, something that sounded like a lullaby.

"I was eleven when the bombs fell," the woman said. "I remember the
sound. Not the explosion — we were too far away for that. The
sound of everything that came after. The wind. The silence. The
way the sky looked for weeks, like someone had pulled a curtain
over it."

"I remember."

"I had a garden before. At my parents' house. Tomatoes. I remember
the way they smelled on the vine. I haven't smelled a tomato in
nineteen years."

Ruth opened her pack. She took out the jar of honey and set it on
the ground between them.

"A man gave me this. A beekeeper. He has six hives. He started with
two, and now he has six."

The woman picked up the jar and held it to the firelight. The honey
glowed, amber and warm, like a piece of trapped sunlight.

"Seeds and honey," the woman said. "Maybe that's enough."

"Maybe."

They shared the honey. They passed the jar around the fire, each
person taking a small taste, holding it on the tongue, closing their
eyes. The children laughed. The man with the harmonica stopped
playing and held the jar to his nose and breathed in, and when he
opened his eyes they were wet.

Ruth slept by the fire. In the morning she walked east. The
dark-haired woman, whose name was Lena, walked with her to the
edge of the camp.

"If you find them," Lena said. "The seeds. Come back this way."

"I will."

"I'll teach the children how to plant. My mother taught me. Before."

Ruth nodded. She adjusted her pack and turned east and did not look
back, because looking back was a luxury she could not afford, and
because the woman's face — young, hungry, fierce with a hope she
would not name — was already planted in her memory where it would
grow whether she tended it or not.


                           * * *

On the sixth day she met the cartographer.

He was sitting in the doorway of a collapsed gas station, surrounded
by sheets of paper covered in fine, careful lines. He was perhaps
forty, thin as wire, with a beard that reached his chest and eyes
that moved constantly, scanning the landscape with the restless
attention of a man who could not stop measuring.

"You're mapping," Ruth said.

He looked up. His eyes focused on her with the particular intensity
of someone who had not spoken to another person in some time.
"Recording," he said. "Someone has to record what's left. What's
changed. The rivers have moved. Did you know that? The Missouri has
shifted its bed three miles south in places. The Platte is gone
entirely — dried up or diverted, I can't tell which. The ground
itself has changed. The topsoil in the blast zones is gone. Just
gone. Down to bedrock in places. But outside the zones —" He held
up a sheet of paper. It was a map, hand-drawn, meticulous, showing
a section of landscape with terrain features marked in different
colors of ink. "Outside the zones, the land is coming back. Slowly.
Differently. But it's coming back."

"Differently how?"

"The plant communities are reorganizing. Species that were rare
before are dominant now. Species that were dominant are gone. It's
a whole new ecology. A whole new Midwest." He paused, looking at
his maps with an expression that was equal parts grief and wonder.
"Someone has to record it. So that when — if — people start farming
again, they'll know what they're working with. You can't plant corn
in soil that's changed its chemistry. You have to know what the
land wants to grow."

Ruth thought of the vault. She thought of the seeds sealed in their
containers, preserved against exactly this need. She thought of
Marcus, who had spent the last three years of his healthy life
sealing those containers, labeling them, building the systems that
would keep them viable, all for a moment exactly like this one.

"I'm going to Ames," she said. "There's a seed vault. My husband
built it."

The cartographer's restless eyes went still. "Seeds," he said.

"Thousands of varieties."

He was quiet for a long time. Then he reached into his pile of maps
and pulled out a sheet — a large one, covering what Ruth estimated
was a fifty-mile radius around their current position. He held it
out to her.

"Take this. It shows the safe routes through the dead zone east of
here. The radiation levels vary. Some paths are worse than others.
The blue lines are the safest. Stay on the blue lines."

Ruth took the map. It was beautiful in its precision, every contour
line measured and verified, every annotation clear and legible. It
was the work of a man who had decided that the most useful thing he
could do in a ruined world was pay very close attention to it.

"Thank you," she said.

"Bring the seeds back," he said. "I'll tell you where to plant
them."


                           * * *

On the eighth day she came to the place where the bombs had fallen.

She knew it before she saw it. The land told her. The ash was
deeper here, finer, a pale gray powder that rose in clouds with
every step and hung in the air like fog. The road was gone — not
broken, not buckled, but gone, erased, replaced by a flat expanse
of nothing that stretched to the horizon in every direction. There
were no buildings. There were no trees. There were no stumps of
guardrails or skeletons of church steeples or mounds of rubble that
had been schools. There was only the ash and the sky and the silence,
which was not the absence of sound but a presence, a weight, the
sound of a million voices that had been turned to dust in a flash
of light brighter than the sun.

Ruth walked through it. She did not stop. She did not look down.
She kept her scarf over her nose and mouth and she followed the blue
lines on the cartographer's map, skirting the worst of the hot
zones, navigating by landmarks that were no longer there — the
intersection of highways that had been vaporized, the site of a
town called Clarinda that was now a shallow depression in the ash,
the dry creek bed that had once been the east fork of the Nodaway
River.

She counted her steps. It was an old trick, a way to keep the mind
occupied when the landscape offered nothing but despair. One, two,
three, a hundred, a thousand. She counted and walked and did not
think about what had happened here, about the people who had lived
in the houses that were now ash, the children who had gone to the
schools that were now nothing, the farmers who had worked the fields
that were now a flat, gray emptiness stretching to a horizon that
offered no comfort and no reprieve.

She thought instead about Marcus. About the way he had looked when
he told her about the vault — not excited, not proud, but grave,
with the particular gravity of a man who understood that he was
building something for a catastrophe he hoped would never come. He
had been a practical man, Marcus. An engineer. He had believed in
redundancy and backup systems and the principle that anything
important should be designed to survive its worst-case scenario. He
had built the vault the way he had built everything — carefully,
thoroughly, with attention to every detail and a quiet faith that
careful work mattered even when the world suggested otherwise.

She walked through the dead zone for two days, eating and drinking
sparingly, sleeping in her bedroll on the bare ground with the map
folded under her head like a pillow. On the second night a wind
came up and blew the ash into shapes that looked like people
walking, and Ruth lay in her bedroll and watched them pass and did
not sleep and did not cry and did not let go of the thought that
waited for her at the end of this emptiness.

When she came out the other side the land had grass.

Not much. Thin, pale, sparse — the kind of grass that grows where
nothing should grow, the first tentative gesture of a world trying
to remember what it was. But it was green. It was alive. And Ruth
stood at the edge of it and looked at it and felt something break
open in her chest, something that had been sealed shut for a long
time.

She knelt. She touched the grass with her fingers. It was coarse
and dry and real.

"There you are," she said.


                           * * *

She found the agricultural station on the eleventh day.

It was a ruin, like everything else — a collection of concrete walls
and collapsed roofing and the rusted remains of equipment that had
once been used to study the science of growing things. The main
building had taken a partial hit from the shockwave; the north wall
was sheared away and the interior was open to the sky, filled with
debris and ash and the small, determined weeds that had colonized
every crack and crevice.

The vault was underneath.

Marcus had described the entrance to her: a service door on the
south side of the main building, leading to a stairwell, leading to
a sub-basement that had been reinforced with concrete and steel and
sealed with an airtight door that required a six-digit code. He had
given her the code. She had memorized it the way she had memorized
everything he told her in those last months — desperately, fiercely,
knowing that his words were the last things of value he had to give.

The service door was buried under two feet of debris. Ruth cleared
it with her hands, pulling away chunks of concrete and twisted metal
and the desiccated remains of things she could not identify and did
not want to. It took her three hours. When she was done, her hands
were bleeding and the door was visible — a steel rectangle, dented
but intact, with a handle and a keypad.

She entered the code. The keypad was dead — no power to the surface
systems. But Marcus had told her about this too. "Manual override,"
he had said. "Panel on the left side. Lever mechanism. Doesn't need
power."

She found the panel. She pulled the lever. Something inside the
door clicked — a mechanical sound, heavy and precise, the sound of
engineering that had been built to work when everything else had
stopped working. The door swung open.

The stairwell was dark. Ruth turned on her flashlight — hand-cranked,
reliable, one of the few pieces of technology she carried — and went
down.

Twelve steps. A landing. Twelve more steps. Another landing. A
corridor, short and narrow, ending in a second door. This one had a
keypad too, but it also had the manual override that Marcus had
described, and when Ruth pulled the lever and the door opened she
felt the air change — cool, dry, sterile, the air of a sealed space
that had been maintained by machines that did not know the world
above them had ended.

The vault was intact.

It was smaller than she had imagined. A room perhaps thirty feet by
forty, with metal shelving on all four walls, floor to ceiling, and
on the shelves — row after row after row — sealed containers.
Hundreds of them. Thousands. Each one labeled in Marcus's precise
handwriting, each one dated, each one containing what he had told
her it would contain.

Seeds.

Wheat. Corn. Soybeans. Tomatoes. Peppers. Squash. Beans. Lettuce.
Carrots. Beets. Onions. Potatoes. Apple. Pear. Cherry. Plum.
Grasses — bluegrass, fescue, rye. Wildflowers — coneflower,
black-eyed Susan, milkweed. Trees — oak, maple, elm, pine.

The labels blurred. Ruth realized she was crying. She had not cried
in years. She had thought she had forgotten how.

In the center of the room was a table, and on the table was an
envelope. It was addressed to no one — simply sealed, waiting for
whoever came. Ruth opened it with trembling fingers.

Inside was a letter in Marcus's handwriting:

   "If you are reading this, then the worst has happened and someone
   has come looking for what we left behind. I don't know who you
   are. I don't know how much time has passed. But I know this: what
   is on these shelves is the most important thing in the world.

   Not because seeds are valuable, though they are. Not because food
   is precious, though it will be. But because seeds are a promise.
   They are the world saying: I am not finished. I have more to
   give. Plant me, and I will show you.

   Be careful with them. Be patient. Be hopeful.

   Marcus Okafor, Ph.D.

Ruth folded the letter and put it in her pocket, next to her heart.
She looked at the shelves. She looked at the seeds. She looked at
the promise.

Then she took off her pack, opened it, and began to fill it.

She could not carry them all. Not even close. But she could carry
enough to start. Enough wheat for a field. Enough corn for a plot.
Enough tomatoes to make a woman who had been eleven when the bombs
fell close her eyes and remember the smell of a vine in summer.
Enough to go back to the camp by the river and say: look. Look what
I found. Look what was waiting for us.

She filled her pack methodically, choosing with care. Wheat went
in first — three sealed containers of hard red winter wheat, the
backbone of a hundred generations of American farming. Then corn —
two containers of open-pollinated varieties, the kind that would
breed true, that you could save seed from and plant again next year
and the year after that, unlike the hybrid varieties that had
dominated before the war and that died with their first generation.
Then soybeans, for protein and nitrogen-fixing and the thousand
other uses that soybeans served in a functioning agricultural
system. Then tomatoes — four varieties, because she was thinking of
Lena, who remembered the smell of tomatoes on the vine.

She packed lettuce and carrots and onions and potatoes. She packed
squash seeds and bean seeds and pepper seeds. She packed a single
container of apple seeds, because an apple tree takes years to bear
fruit but Ruth was thinking in years now, thinking in decades,
thinking in the timescale that Marcus had taught her to think in —
the timescale of someone who plants things they may not live to
harvest.

She packed grass seed. Bluegrass and fescue, the common grasses of
the Midwest that had once covered the plains in an ocean of green
and that now existed only here, in sealed containers in a vault
beneath a ruin, waiting for someone to give them back to the earth.

When her pack was full — heavy, straining at the seams, the weight
of it settling into her shoulders like a yoke — she stood in the
center of the vault and looked at what remained. Hundreds of
containers, thousands of varieties, more seed than she could carry
in a lifetime of trips. But the vault was here. It would wait. She
would come back, and she would bring others, and they would carry
the seeds out into the damaged world a pack at a time until the
shelves were empty and the fields were full.

She sealed the vault behind her. She climbed the stairs into the
gray light of a damaged world, and she turned west, toward the camp,
toward the beekeeper, toward Omaha, toward every broken place she
had walked through, carrying on her back the weight of everything
the world had lost and everything the world could still become.

Ruth walked west.

The grass was thin and pale and alive, and it bent under her boots,
and it sprang back when she passed.

================================================================================
                      "THE LAST SATURNALIA"
                       by Cordell Beaumont
================================================================================

   I.

The jungle breathed.

Dr. Elara Voss stood at the edge of the landing clearing and
listened to it — the vast, rhythmic respiration of a biosphere that
had been growing and dying and growing again for longer than her
species had existed. The air was thick with moisture and the scent
of chlorophyll analogues, sweet and faintly metallic, and the canopy
above her was a cathedral of interlocking fronds and tendrils and
bioluminescent filaments that cast the understory in a perpetual
twilight of emerald and gold. The gravity was lighter than Earth's
— Verdance was a small moon, three-quarters terrestrial mass,
orbiting the gas giant Polyphemus in the Tau Ceti system — and
the lightness made everything seem to float, as if the jungle were
an undersea kingdom rendered in leaves and light.

She had been on Verdance for seven months, embedded with the Keth.

The Keth were not what popular xenology had led her to expect.
Popular xenology, informed by decades of science fiction and a
handful of actual first-contact encounters with microbial life,
imagined alien civilizations as either inscrutable hive-minds or
humanoids with exotic skin tones. The Keth were neither. They were
arboreal, roughly bipedal, standing perhaps four feet tall, with
four arms arranged radially around a central torso and skin that
shifted color with their emotional state — a deep indigo when calm,
bright amber when excited, pale silver when afraid. Their eyes were
large, dark, and pupilless, set in faces that were too flat and too
wide to be called humanoid but too expressive to be called alien,
and they communicated through a combination of vocalizations,
chromatic displays, and a complex gestural language that used all
four arms simultaneously and was, in Elara's professional opinion,
the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.

They called themselves the Keth-ra-sol, which translated,
approximately, as "the people who remember the forest." They lived
in the canopy, building elaborate structures from woven vines and
cultivated fungal growths, and they practiced a form of agriculture
that was so perfectly integrated with the jungle's natural cycles
that it was nearly indistinguishable from wilderness. They were, by
any standard Elara could apply, a civilization — complete with art,
music, oral history, spiritual practice, and a social structure of
remarkable sophistication.

They were also, she was beginning to realize, profoundly strange.

In seven months, Elara had filled forty-three notebooks with
observations, sketches, linguistic analyses, and the kind of raw,
unprocessed impressions that she would later shape into the formal
prose of her ethnographic report. She had learned to eat their food
— the fermented fungal preparations that tasted of earth and age, the
sweet nectar drawn from the great flowers of the canopy, the small
roasted insects that were a protein staple and that Elara had forced
herself to enjoy until the forcing was no longer necessary. She had
learned to sleep in the canopy, in the woven hammocks the Keth
used, swaying gently in the warm updrafts that rose from the jungle
floor. She had learned to read the basic chromatic vocabulary of
their skin — indigo for calm, amber for excitement, silver for fear,
green for curiosity, a deep rose for affection — though the more
complex emotional states remained opaque to her, layered and
shifting in ways that her human perceptual apparatus could register
but not decode.

She had learned, most importantly, to be still. The Keth valued
stillness in a way that no human culture Elara had encountered ever
had. They could sit motionless for hours, their skin cycling through
slow, meditative color patterns, their large eyes half-closed, their
breathing synchronized with some rhythm that Elara could feel but
not identify — the rhythm of the jungle itself, perhaps, or of the
moon's slow orbit around its gas giant parent, or of something older
and more fundamental still. Elara had learned to sit with them, to
match her breathing to theirs, to let the jungle's sounds and scents
wash over her without trying to catalog or categorize them. It was
the hardest thing she had ever learned to do, and it was, she
suspected, the most important.

Reth-ka had noticed. "You are learning to listen," Reth-ka had said
one evening, all four arms tracing a pattern that the translator
rendered as approval. "Most of your kind cannot listen. They are too
full of their own noise."

"We are a noisy species," Elara had agreed.

"The forest does not speak to those who are noisy. The forest speaks
to those who are quiet enough to hear."

Elara had written this down. She had not yet understood what it
meant.


   II.

The festival had been building for weeks.

Elara had first noticed it in the subtle shifts of the Keth's
chromatography — a gradual intensification of their amber tones,
moving from the pale gold of mild excitement to a deep, saturated
saffron that she had not seen before. Their vocalizations grew more
elaborate, more melodic, layered with harmonics that seemed to
resonate with the jungle itself, as if the forest were an instrument
and the Keth were learning a new piece. Their constructions in the
canopy became increasingly ornate — garlands of bioluminescent
flowers, tapestries of woven silk-analog, elaborate geometric
patterns traced in cultivated moss on the surfaces of the great
trees.

She asked Reth-ka about it. Reth-ka was her primary informant and
translator, a senior Keth of indeterminate age — the Keth did not
mark time in years but in "growings," which corresponded roughly to
the moon's orbital period around Polyphemus — who had taken an
interest in Elara that she attributed partly to scientific curiosity
and partly to the Keth gift for hospitality, which was extraordinary.

"It is the Turning," Reth-ka said, all four arms moving in the
flowing, sinuous patterns of formal Keth speech. Elara's translator
— a neural-linked device that had been learning the Keth gestural
language for seven months and was still only partially competent —
rendered the concept as "Turning," but the gestural modifiers
suggested something richer: a rotation, a cycle, a transformation
that was both ending and beginning.

"A festival?" Elara asked.

"A Turning," Reth-ka repeated, and the chromatic shift that
accompanied the word was complex — amber shading to a deep,
resonant crimson that Elara had never seen before and could not
interpret. "The forest gives. The people take. The people give. The
forest takes. This is the Turning."

"A harvest festival," Elara said, and wrote it down in her
fieldnotes, and felt the familiar satisfaction of a concept clicking
into place within an anthropological framework.

She was wrong. She would not understand how wrong for another three
weeks.


   III.

The preparations accelerated.

The Keth began to gather food — enormous quantities of it,
harvested from the canopy farms and the fungal gardens and the
river-nets that caught the small, silver-scaled creatures that
swam in the streams threading through the jungle floor. They
processed the food with methods Elara found fascinating:
fermentation in sealed fungal pods, smoking over fires of aromatic
bark, drying on racks of woven vine exposed to the diffuse light
that filtered through the canopy. The quantities were staggering —
far more than the community could consume, even at the most
extravagant feast.

They also began to gather flowers.

Not the ordinary blooms of the canopy, which were extravagant enough
in their own right — vast, orchid-like structures in shades of
violet and crimson and electric blue, filling the air with
fragrances that ranged from the sublime to the narcotic. These were
different. They grew deep in the jungle, in places Elara had not
been permitted to visit, and they were brought to the settlement in
sealed containers by Keth who had painted their skin with elaborate
geometric patterns and who moved with a solemnity that bordered on
the liturgical.

The flowers were white. Not the white of paper or snow or bone, but
a luminous, phosphorescent white that seemed to generate its own
light, pulsing gently in the rhythm of some unseen heartbeat. They
were beautiful. They were also, Elara's environmental sensors told
her, mildly psychoactive — releasing trace compounds into the air
that interacted with mammalian neurochemistry in ways that her
analyzer could identify but not fully characterize.

She asked Reth-ka about the flowers.

"They are the voice of the forest," Reth-ka said, and the
chromatographic accompaniment was that same deep crimson, that
color Elara could not read. "When the Turning comes, the forest
speaks. The flowers are how we listen."

"Are they safe? For me?"

Reth-ka's four arms moved in a gesture that the translator rendered
as a pause, a consideration, a weighing of factors. Then: "The
forest speaks to all who listen. Whether the words are the same —"
The gesture trailed off, unfinished, which was unusual for Reth-ka,
who was precise in speech to the point of formality.

"You don't know if they're safe for humans."

"We do not know. You are the first."

This should have been a warning. Elara recognized it as a warning.
She wrote it down in her fieldnotes and flagged it with the
standard cautionary notation that the Interstellar Ethnographic
Bureau required for situations involving unknown biological
exposure. And then she continued with her observations, because she
was an ethnographer, and the Turning was the most significant
cultural event she had witnessed in seven months of fieldwork, and
the desire to understand it was stronger than the desire to be safe.

This is the oldest mistake in the history of anthropology. Elara
knew this. She made it anyway.


   IV.

The Turning began at dusk.

The Keth gathered in the great clearing at the center of their
settlement — a natural amphitheater formed by the convergence of
four enormous trees, their trunks as wide as buildings, their
canopy so dense that it formed a living ceiling fifty meters above.
Bioluminescent filaments threaded through the canopy cast the
clearing in a shifting mosaic of green and gold and violet, and the
white flowers had been arranged in concentric circles on the ground,
their phosphorescent glow adding a layer of cool, steady light to
the spectacle.

There were perhaps three hundred Keth in the clearing. Elara had
estimated the total population of this settlement at around four
hundred, which meant that nearly every individual was present. They
were arranged in groups — family units, Elara assumed, based on
her observations of Keth social structure — and they were all
displaying the deep saffron amber of heightened excitement, their
skin shimmering in the bioluminescent light like living jewels.

The food was brought out first. It was laid on raised platforms of
woven vine — an astonishing abundance of it, enough to feed the
settlement for weeks, arranged with an artistry that spoke of ritual
rather than mere sustenance. The Keth began to eat, and the eating
was accompanied by song — a low, polyphonic chanting that rose from
the gathered assembly like heat from stone, building in complexity
and volume, layered with harmonics that Elara's translator could
not process because they were not language but something older and
more fundamental.

Elara ate with them. The food was extraordinary — not merely the
everyday Keth cuisine she had been eating for seven months, but
festival food, dishes she had never been offered before, prepared
with an artistry that suggested centuries of refinement. There were
fungal preparations that had been aged for years in sealed chambers
deep in the roots of the great trees, their flavors concentrated and
layered, savory and sweet and bitter in alternating waves. There were
fruits she had not seen before — luminous, jewel-like capsules that
burst on the tongue with flavors that had no terrestrial equivalent,
tastes that seemed to occupy dimensions beyond the normal range of
human perception. There were braised insects glazed with nectar
reductions, their shells crackling with a caramelized sweetness that
was almost unbearably delicious.

She drank the fermented nectar they offered — not the mild, everyday
variety she had consumed before, but a ceremonial vintage,
thicker and more complex, tasting of flowers and earth and something
electric, something that tingled at the base of the skull and made
the colors of the clearing seem to intensify and sharpen. She
understood, with the part of her brain that was still thinking
analytically, that the nectar contained psychoactive compounds —
different from the flowers, milder, but working in concert with
them, preparing the body and mind for what was to come.

She sat among the Keth and ate and drank and listened to the singing
and watched the white flowers pulse with their slow, steady light,
and she felt the old ethnographer's joy — the joy of being inside a
culture, seeing it from within, understanding it not as a specimen
but as a world.

The singing intensified. The Keth began to move — not dancing,
exactly, but a rhythmic swaying that involved the entire body, all
four arms tracing patterns in the air that were too complex and too
coordinated to be improvised. The patterns were the same geometric
forms that Elara had seen traced in moss on the great trees and
painted on the skin of the flower-gatherers: spirals, nested
circles, branching fractals that echoed the structure of the jungle
itself.

The white flowers began to release their fragrance in earnest.

Elara smelled it — heavy, sweet, layered, with a depth that seemed
to have dimensions, as if the scent were not just a chemical
signal but a spatial experience, a room you could walk into and
explore. Her environmental sensors chirped a warning: elevated
concentrations of the uncharacterized psychoactive compounds. She
noted the warning. She did not leave.

The singing reached a crescendo. The Keth's skin was cycling through
colors Elara had never seen — the deep crimson she could not read,
a luminous white that matched the flowers, a violet so dark it was
nearly black, all of them shifting and blending and separating in
patterns that seemed to move not just across the surface of the
Keth's skin but through it, as if the color were rising from
somewhere deep inside them.

And then, as if a switch had been thrown, the singing stopped.

The silence was absolute. Three hundred Keth, motionless, their
skin settled into a uniform silver — the color of fear, Elara knew,
but this was not fear, or not only fear; it was something else,
something the silver contained but did not express, something for
which Elara had no translation.

Reth-ka was beside her. Reth-ka's skin was silver too, but shot
through with veins of that deep, unreadable crimson, and Reth-ka's
large, dark eyes were fixed on Elara with an expression that was
not hostile, not welcoming, not curious, but something that
encompassed all three and transcended them.

"Now," Reth-ka said, "the forest speaks."


   V.

The forest spoke.

Elara would never be able to describe what happened next in the
precise, clinical language of ethnographic reportage. She would try,
in the months and years that followed, to render it in the
vocabulary of science — neurochemical response, psychoactive
compound interaction, mass psychogenic event — and the words would
sit on the page like dead insects, drained of everything that had
made them alive.

What happened was this:

The white flowers opened. Not the gradual unfurling of petals that
Elara had observed in their cultivated specimens, but a sudden,
simultaneous blossoming — every flower in the clearing opening at
once, releasing a cloud of luminous pollen that rose into the air
like a breath made visible. The pollen was not white but every
color, a prismatic mist that refracted the bioluminescent light
of the canopy into a thousand shifting hues, and it carried with
it a fragrance so intense, so complex, so overwhelmingly present
that Elara felt her conscious mind step back, as if making room
for something larger.

The jungle responded. The great trees — those ancient, building-
sized organisms that formed the pillars of the Keth's world — began
to resonate. Elara felt it through the soles of her feet first, a
deep vibration that rose through her bones and her blood and her
brain, and then she heard it: a sound below the threshold of
language, below the threshold of music, a sound that was the voice
of a living system speaking in the only language it had, which was
the language of growth and decay, of photosynthesis and respiration,
of roots reaching into darkness and leaves reaching into light.

The Keth understood this language. Elara could see it in the way
their skin responded — cascading waves of color that were not
emotional displays but conversations, responses, replies to
something the forest was saying. They stood in the clearing and
they listened and they answered, and the exchange was so beautiful
and so alien that Elara felt tears on her face and did not know
when they had started.

She could feel it too — not as language, not as thought, but as
something more primal, more direct. Through the soles of her feet,
through the air she was breathing, through the pollen that had
settled on her skin and in her lungs, she could feel the forest's
awareness — not a mind in any human sense, but a vast, distributed
intelligence that encompassed every root and leaf and fungal thread
and microorganism in the biosphere. It was alive in a way that
transcended the boundaries between individual and ecosystem, between
organism and environment. It was the jungle, thinking. The moon,
dreaming. A billion years of evolution, contemplating its own
continuity.

And the Keth were part of it. They had always been part of it.
They were not inhabitants of the forest; they were expressions of
it, the way a wave is an expression of the ocean — temporary
arrangements of matter and energy, given form and consciousness
and the capacity for joy, and then, when their time was done,
returned to the source from which they had emerged.

Elara's ethnographic training told her that this was not possible.
Organisms did not dissolve into their ecosystems. Individuals did
not merge with their environments. Biology did not work this way.

But she was standing in a clearing on a moon four light-years from
Earth, surrounded by alien beings whose skin spoke in colors, in a
jungle that hummed with the voice of a planetary consciousness, and
biology, she was forced to admit, might work in ways that humanity
had not yet imagined.

And then the forest asked.

She felt it as a question — not in words, not in any linguistic
structure her human mind could parse, but as a sensation, a
pressure, a gentle but undeniable pull that was directed at her
specifically, at the biological reality of her body, at the carbon
and water and trace minerals that composed her, at the life that
animated those elements and gave them form.

The forest was asking for something back.

Reth-ka's hand — small, four-fingered, warm — closed around Elara's
wrist. "The forest gives," Reth-ka said. "The people take. The
people give. The forest takes. This is the Turning."

Elara looked around the clearing. The Keth were changing. Their
skin — that marvelous, chromatographic skin — was doing something
she had never seen: it was becoming translucent. She could see
through it, into them, and what she saw was not anatomy but light —
a green, pulsing, vegetative light that seemed to rise from their
cores and spread outward through their bodies like sap rising in a
tree.

The oldest Keth — the elders, the ones whose faces were lined with
years and whose skin had lost the vibrancy of youth — were
changing fastest. Their outlines were softening, blurring, merging
with the luminous pollen that filled the air. They were not dying.
Elara's scientific mind, still functioning beneath the flood of
wonder, recognized this with absolute clarity. They were not dying.
They were transforming. They were becoming something else — something
that was part of the forest, that had always been part of the forest,
that had spent a lifetime in the shape of a Keth and was now
returning to the shape of the world.

One by one, the eldest members of the community dissolved. There was
no violence in it, no pain, no struggle. They simply became light,
became color, became fragrance, became the forest, and the forest
received them the way soil receives rain — gratefully, completely,
without remainder.

And in the spaces where the elders had stood, something was growing.

Small shapes, curled and pale and luminous, rising from the ground
like seedlings, unfolding with the speed of time-lapse photography
into forms that were unmistakably Keth — newborn, tiny, already
displaying the chromatographic skin of their kind, their eyes
already open, their four arms already reaching for the light.

The people give. The forest takes. The forest gives. The people take.

This was not a metaphor. This was not a ritual reenactment of a
natural cycle. This was the cycle itself, literal, biological, real.
The Keth did not die and reproduce in the manner of terrestrial
organisms. They returned to the forest, and the forest made them
again, and the festival — the Turning — was the mechanism by which
this exchange occurred.

Elara understood. And in the moment of understanding, she felt the
pull again — stronger now, more specific, directed at her with a
precision that left no room for ambiguity.

She had been chosen.

The forest had tasted her. Seven months of breathing its air,
eating its food, walking its paths, absorbing its pollen — seven
months of integration, of becoming part of the ecosystem in ways
she had not noticed and could not have prevented. The forest knew
her now. The forest wanted her. Not as food, not as prey, but as
something to be transformed — taken apart and reassembled, carbon
by carbon, into something new.

"Reth-ka," Elara said. Her voice was calm. She was surprised by
how calm it was. "I have been chosen."

"Yes."

"I will die."

Reth-ka's four arms moved in a gesture that the translator could
not render. Then: "You will change. What you are now will end.
What you become will be — " The gesture again, complex, unreadable.
"More."

"More."

"The forest does not diminish. It transforms. What was one thing
becomes another thing. What was separate becomes joined. This is not
death. This is — " And here Reth-ka used a word that the translator
flagged as untranslatable, a Keth concept with no human equivalent,
a word that seemed to mean something like "the joy of becoming part
of something larger than yourself."

Elara looked at the clearing. The transformation was nearly
complete. The elders were gone — absorbed, dissolved, returned. In
their place, a dozen newborn Keth were taking their first breaths,
their skin flickering with color, their eyes reflecting the
bioluminescent light of a world that had made them and would one
day unmake them and make them again. The remaining Keth — the
young, the middle-aged, those whose time had not yet come —
were gathered around the newborns, their skin blazing with amber
joy, their arms tracing patterns of welcome.

The pull was gentle. It was warm. It was, Elara realized with a
shock that went deeper than fear, beautiful. The forest was not
threatening her. It was inviting her. It was offering her the same
gift it gave its own children: the chance to be part of something
vast and old and endlessly renewing, to stop being a visitor and
become a native, to trade the loneliness of observation for the
communion of participation.

She could feel it working in her — the pollen, the compounds, the
seven months of slow integration. Her skin tingled. Her vision
shifted, colors brightening, edges softening. She could feel the
forest around her, not as an environment but as a presence, a
consciousness, a mind so large and so slow and so patient that it
made human thought look like the flickering of a candle in a
cathedral.

Elara Voss, Doctor of Xenological Studies, Fellow of the
Interstellar Ethnographic Bureau, stood in a clearing on a jungle
moon four light-years from Earth and felt the oldest temptation in
the history of her discipline: the temptation to go native.

To stop watching. To stop recording. To stop being the outsider
looking in and become, instead, part of what she had come to study.

The pull intensified. Her fingers were tingling. When she held them
up to the light, she could see through them — not bone and sinew
and capillary but a soft green glow, the beginning of something,
the first tentative merger of her biology with the forest's vast
and ancient chemistry.

She thought about Earth. She thought about her apartment in
Zurich, with its view of the Alps and its shelves of books and its
small kitchen where she made coffee every morning. She thought
about her parents, retired in Marseille, who sent her weekly
messages that took four years to arrive and who would, if she did
not return, never know what had happened to her — only that their
daughter had gone to a moon around a distant star and had not come
back.

She thought about her notebooks. Forty-three of them, filled with
observations that no other human being had ever made, descriptions
of a civilization that no other human being had ever seen. If she
stayed — if she let the forest take her — those notebooks would be
lost. The Interstellar Ethnographic Bureau would send a recovery
team, eventually, but they would find only the notebooks, and
the notebooks without Elara to interpret them would be data without
meaning, observations without understanding, the raw material of
knowledge but not knowledge itself.

The forest was singing to her in a voice that was older than
language, and the song was the most beautiful thing she had ever
heard. It promised union. It promised belonging. It promised the
end of the loneliness that was the ethnographer's constant
companion — the loneliness of the observer, always outside, always
watching, never fully part of anything.

But it also promised the end of Elara. Not death — Reth-ka had been
clear about that. Transformation. She would become something else,
something that was part of the forest, something that might retain
fragments of what she had been but would no longer be her. She
would gain the forest. She would lose herself.

Elara closed her eyes. She breathed in the luminous air. She felt
the forest waiting, patient, ancient, kind.

She thought about the forty-three notebooks. She thought about the
people who would read them. She thought about the next ethnographer
who would come to Verdance, armed with Elara's observations, and
who would understand things that Elara had only glimpsed. The work
mattered more than the worker. The knowledge mattered more than
the knower. This was the principle she had built her career on, and
it was the principle that would save her life.

She reached into her pocket and pressed the emergency beacon on her
communicator.

It was the hardest thing she had ever done.

"I'm sorry," she said to Reth-ka. "I'm not ready."

Reth-ka's skin cycled through colors — amber, crimson, silver,
and finally a pale, steady blue that Elara had seen only once
before, in a Keth mother watching her offspring climb into the
canopy for the first time. The translator rendered it, tentatively,
as understanding.

"The forest is patient," Reth-ka said. "It will ask again."

"I know."

The shuttle would come. The beacon would bring it, screaming down
through Verdance's atmosphere on pillars of fire, and it would take
her away from this place, this clearing, this moment, and she would
write her report and present her findings and the Interstellar
Ethnographic Bureau would classify the Turning as a Category Seven
cultural phenomenon and restrict future contact to remote
observation only, and no human would stand in this clearing again
for a generation.

But the forest would remember. The forest would wait. And somewhere
in the back of Elara's mind, in the place where the pollen had
settled and the song still echoed, a small, green tendril of
something that was not quite memory and not quite desire would
continue to grow, reaching toward a light she had chosen not to
follow.

Not yet. Not yet.

The white flowers pulsed in the dark, patient as seeds.

                         ABOUT THE AUTHORS
================================================================================

HAROLD "HAL" MERCER has been writing science fiction for twenty-three
years, a span he notes is considerably shorter than the terraforming
project described in his latest story. A former chemical engineer with
Dow Chemical and a veteran of the Pacific Theater, Hal brings an
engineer's eye for detail and a veteran's respect for long campaigns
to everything he writes. He has published over forty stories in
*Astounding*, *Galaxy*, and *The Magazine of Fantasy & Science
Fiction*, and his novel *The Long Burn* (Gnome Press, 1951) was a
finalist for the International Fantasy Award. He lives in Pasadena,
California, where he grows roses and insists that patience is a
technical skill. "The Greening of Acidalia" is his fourth appearance
in these pages.

FRANKLIN HOYT is a name that makes editors nervous and readers
uneasy, which is precisely as he intends. A former journalist who
covered the Nuremberg trials for the *Chicago Daily News*, Hoyt
turned to fiction in 1948 with the stated goal of "making the
comfortable uncomfortable." His stories have appeared in *Galaxy*,
*Worlds Beyond*, and *Other Worlds Science Stories*, and his
collection *The Compliance Engine* (Shasta Publishers, 1952) was
praised by Damon Knight as "the most unsettling book of the year."
He lives in Greenwich Village, New York, drinks too much coffee, and
is working on a novel he describes as "Orwell with footnotes."

REX DRUMMOND writes the kind of science fiction that leaves scorch
marks on the page. A former merchant marine and amateur boxer from
Galveston, Texas, Rex sold his first story to *Planet Stories* in
1946 and has been setting the pulp world on fire ever since. His
"Captain Vega" series for *Thrilling Wonder Stories* has earned him
a devoted following among readers who prefer their space opera loud,
fast, and unapologetic. His novels include *Raiders of the Red
Nebula* and *Sword of the Star Kings* (both Ace Books). Rex lives
on a houseboat in Galveston Bay, where he writes, fishes, and
maintains that "a good space battle is worth a thousand philosophical
arguments." We do not entirely agree, but we publish him anyway.

THEODORE CAIN is the pen name of a mathematics professor at a small
New England college who prefers to keep his academic and literary
lives separate, a preference we are happy to respect. His stories
have appeared in *Astounding*, *Galaxy*, *If*, and *The Magazine of
Fantasy & Science Fiction*, and are distinguished by their
intellectual rigor, their moral complexity, and their quiet refusal
to offer easy answers. "Progeny" is his second contribution to
*Tales from the Future and Beyond*; his first, "The Theorem" (Issue
#1), generated more reader mail than any other story we have
published to date. We expect "Progeny" to surpass it.

AGNES WHITFIELD lives and writes in rural Vermont, where she keeps
goats, grows vegetables, and contemplates the fragility of the
systems that sustain human life. A former nurse who served with the
Red Cross in Europe during the war, Agnes brings to her fiction a
firsthand understanding of what it means to care for people in
extremis. Her stories have appeared in *Galaxy*, *The Magazine of
Fantasy & Science Fiction*, and *Fantastic Universe*, and her
novelette "After the Sirens" was reprinted in Judith Merril's
*Year's Best* anthology. "Dust and Cinders" is her first appearance
in these pages, and we are honored to present it.

CORDELL BEAUMONT is a professor of comparative literature at Howard
University and a writer whose fiction blends the rigor of
anthropological observation with the lush, sensory prose of the
best literary fantasy. Born in New Orleans and educated at Fisk
University and the Sorbonne, Cordell brings to science fiction a
cosmopolitan perspective and a deep fascination with the ways
cultures construct meaning. His stories have appeared in *Galaxy*,
*The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction*, and *Startling Stories*,
and his novel *The Emerald Threshold* (Fantasy Press, 1952) was
called "a masterwork of xenological imagination" by Anthony Boucher.
He lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife and two children.

                 SIGNALS RECEIVED — Letters to the Editor
================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading "The Theorem" by Theodore Cain in your
inaugural issue and I must say it is the finest piece of speculative
fiction I have encountered since Asimov's "The Last Question." The
way Cain explores the implications of mathematical discovery for
human identity is nothing short of brilliant. I am a mathematics
graduate student at Columbia and I can attest that the technical
details ring true, which is more than I can say for most fiction that
attempts to engage with higher mathematics. More Cain, please!

— Robert Altschuler, New York, N.Y.

*We are happy to oblige. See this issue's "Progeny." — Ed.*

Dear Editor,

I read "When the Stars Went Dark" by Margaret Liu in Issue #2 with
great interest, but I must take exception to her portrayal of the
military response to the stellar anomaly. As a retired Army colonel,
I can assure you that the Joint Chiefs would never authorize the
kind of unilateral action described in the story's third act. The
chain of command exists for a reason, and that reason is precisely
the sort of crisis Mrs. Liu depicts.

That said, the story was otherwise excellent, and I look forward to
seeing more of her work.

— Col. (Ret.) James Farrow, Arlington, Va.

*We have forwarded your letter to Mrs. Liu, who responds: "The
Colonel is correct about the chain of command. He is incorrect about
what people do when they are frightened. I have met frightened
generals." — Ed.*

~ ~ ~

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am fourteen years old and I have read every issue of Tales from
the Future and Beyond cover to cover. My favorite story so far is
"The Iron Garden" by Harold Mercer in Issue #2. I want to be an
engineer when I grow up, and Mr. Mercer's stories make me believe
that engineering is not just about building things but about caring
for them. Thank you for publishing a magazine that takes both
science and fiction seriously.

— Patricia Kowalski, Pittsburgh, Pa.

*Miss Kowalski, you have made Mr. Mercer's year. He asks us to tell
you that "the world needs more engineers who care." We agree. — Ed.*

~ ~ ~

Dear Tales,

Your magazine is too long, your stories are too serious, and your
editor's letters sound like Sunday sermons. I read science fiction
for rocket ships and ray guns, not moral philosophy. When are you
going to publish some real action?

— Name Withheld, Los Angeles, Calif.

*See "The Pirate Queen of the Asteroids" in this issue. We trust it
contains sufficient rockets and guns to satisfy even the most
carnivorous reader. We make no promises about the moral philosophy.
— Ed.*

~ ~ ~

Dear Maxwell,

I notice that your first two issues featured a combined total of
eleven stories, of which exactly two were written by women. I trust
you will do better. The future belongs to all of us.

— Miriam Goldstein, Berkeley, Calif.

*You are right, and we are doing better. This issue features stories
by Agnes Whitfield, whose "Dust and Cinders" is among the finest
things we have published. We are committed to finding and featuring
the best writers working in the field, regardless of any
consideration other than the quality of their work. — Ed.*

              THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW — Book Reviews
================================================================================

THE DEMOLISHED MAN by Alfred Bester
(Shasta Publishers, 1953, $3.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Alfred Bester has written a novel that reads like a jazz improvisation
played at the speed of thought. *The Demolished Man* is a murder
mystery set in a future where telepathy is real and murder is
therefore supposed to be impossible — and yet Ben Reich, industrialist
and sociopath, intends to commit one anyway. The result is a book
that is by turns brilliant, maddening, exhilarating, and
occasionally incomprehensible, written in a style so far ahead of
the field that most of us are still trying to figure out where
Bester is standing. The narrative pyrotechnics — typographic
experiments, stream-of-consciousness passages, puzzle-structures
embedded in the text — may alienate readers accustomed to the more
stately prose of the Campbellian school, but those willing to
surrender to Bester's velocity will find themselves rewarded with
one of the most inventive and audacious science fiction novels ever
published. Essential reading. The future of the field may well look
like this.

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clarke
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Arthur Clarke has always been our most elegant futurist, and
*Childhood's End* is perhaps his most elegant work — a novel of
first contact and last contact, of the end of childhood (humanity's)
and the beginning of something that may or may not be adulthood.
The Overlords arrive, benevolent and mysterious, and guide humanity
toward a golden age that turns out to be a prelude to transcendence.
Clarke writes with his customary clarity and precision, building his
cosmic vision brick by careful brick, and the final chapters achieve
a genuine grandeur that is rare in any literature, let alone ours.
If Bester's *Demolished Man* is the future of science fiction's
style, Clarke's *Childhood's End* may be the apotheosis of its
substance. Together, they make 1953 a vintage year.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Sturgeon's fix-up novel, assembled from previously published
novellas including the remarkable "Baby Is Three," is that rarest
of science fiction achievements: a book about superhuman abilities
that is relentlessly, achingly human. The story of Homo Gestalt — a
composite being assembled from damaged, misfit individuals who
together form something greater than any could be alone — is told
with Sturgeon's characteristic warmth, psychological acuity, and
prose that moves between lyricism and gut-punch with the ease of
a born storyteller. This is not a novel about power. It is a novel
about belonging, about the desperate need to be part of something,
and about the terrifying possibility that the next step in human
evolution might not look like progress at all. Magnificent.

   crew finds a generation ship that has been drifting for three
   hundred years — and whose descendants have forgotten they are on
   a ship at all.

   "The Cartographer's Daughter" by Cordell Beaumont — On a world
   where the geography changes with the seasons, a young woman
   inherits her father's impossible profession: making maps of a
   place that refuses to hold still.
