TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITORS' DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

We owe you a warning. The issue you hold in your hands is not shaped like the magazine you are accustomed to receiving. It is longer. It is heavier. It is, by any reasonable measure, the most ambitious single issue we have published in fourteen years and seventy-one numbers.

The reason is Julian St. Croix.

When the manuscript of "The Atlas of Unborn Futures" arrived at our offices in May — all one hundred and twelve pages of it, handwritten in St. Croix's elegant, maddening, nearly illegible script — we understood immediately that we faced a choice. We could edit the story to a conventional length, carving away the prose that makes it extraordinary in order to make it fit a magazine that has always valued economy. Or we could let the story be what it is: the longest work we have ever published, by a considerable margin, and one of the most remarkable pieces of fiction to appear in any science fiction magazine in any year.

We chose the latter. We are not sorry.

"The Atlas of Unborn Futures" is the sequel to "The Cartographer of Lost Tomorrows," which appeared in these pages in Issue #56 and which many readers — and both editors — consider among the finest stories this magazine has produced. In that story, Erasmus Veil exposed a conspiracy to eliminate humane futures from the calculations of the Bureau of Temporal Inference. In this sequel, Veil discovers that the conspiracy is vaster than any single timeline can contain. It spans the multiverse. It exists in every possible world. And Veil's attempt to fight an enemy that is, quite literally, everywhere — an enemy woven into the fabric of probability itself — is a work of such sustained imaginative power that we found ourselves, upon finishing it, sitting in silence for a very long time.

St. Croix has always been a divisive figure in these pages. We know that some of you find his prose excessive, his structures bewildering, his ambitions exhausting. We ask those readers for patience, and we promise that the four stories that follow — each one superb — will reward those who prefer their fiction leaner. Margaret Thornton gives us a story of ecological elegy that is among her finest. Theodore Cain delivers a satire of the afterlife that is both hilarious and unexpectedly moving. Dr. Vincent Koslov confronts the terrifying possibility that the laws of physics are not permanent. And Phyllis Crenshaw sends a visitor from the future on a tour of 1967 America that will make you see your own world with unsettling clarity.

Five stories. Five visions. One of them the longest we have ever printed. We believe this is the issue that people will remember when they remember this magazine.

Tell us if we are right.

The future, as ever, awaits.

Yours among the stars,

         THE CARTOGRAPHER OF LOST TOMORROWS, PART II:
              THE ATLAS OF UNBORN FUTURES

                    by Julian St. Croix

================================================================================

                           I.

The letter arrived on a morning in November, fourteen months after the Bureau of Temporal Inference had erased Erasmus Veil from its personnel records with the same administrative precision it applied to erasing futures from the Engine's calculations — a symmetry that Veil, who had spent his professional life cataloguing patterns, was unable to appreciate as anything other than confirmation that the machinery of institutional power operated according to consistent principles regardless of whether the thing being processed was a probability map or a man.

He was living, at the time, in two rooms above the bookshop on the Rue Voltaire — the same bookshop through which the Cartographers' Guild had once passed its coded messages hidden in the margins of antiquarian atlases, though the shop's proprietor, a stooped and philosophical man named Montague who had once been a Bureau topographer before the first purge, now allowed Veil to use the back room as both residence and workshop, the distinction between the two having long since dissolved into the general condition of a life organized entirely around the act of writing futures that others were determined to destroy.

The room was small and dense with paper. Maps covered every surface — hand-drawn probability topographies on sheets of translucent vellum that Veil had copied from the Guild's diminishing supply of intercepted Bureau discards, narrative translations pinned to the walls in overlapping layers that created a palimpsest of unrealized worlds, and, occupying the desk in a stack that had grown over the preceding months to a height of nearly two feet, the accumulated pages of what Veil had begun to call, with an irony that was also a prayer, The Atlas of Lost Tomorrows — his comprehensive narrative translation of every suppressed future he had documented, rendered in language precise enough to be understood and vivid enough to be desired.

The work had consumed him. Not in the romantic sense that writers sometimes invoke when describing obsession — not the feverish burning of a man driven by passion beyond the boundaries of reason — but in the slower, more thorough sense of a process that simply took everything. His savings, first: the suspended pension had been his only financial resource, and fourteen months of rent and vellum and ink and bread had reduced it to a figure he no longer consulted. His health, next: he ate irregularly, slept in fragments, and had developed a persistent cough that Montague attributed to the paper dust and Veil attributed to nothing, having ceased to think about his body as anything other than the mechanism by which the pen was moved across the page. His connections, finally: the Guild, which had been his only community since his expulsion from the Bureau, was fragmenting under the pressure of the Consortium's counter-intelligence operations, its members scattered, its channels of communication increasingly compromised.

Lena Deschamps had disappeared in August. One day her coded messages arrived through the bookshop's network; the next, silence. Veil had spent three weeks attempting to make contact through secondary channels before a note arrived — unsigned, written in a hand he did not recognize — informing him that Deschamps had been detained by the Bureau's security division and was being held at an undisclosed location for what the note, with the deadpan formality of bureaucratic euphemism, described as "extended administrative review."

Veil had read the note, set it aside, and returned to the Atlas. He understood, with a clarity born of exhaustion rather than courage, that the work was the only form of resistance available to him, and that stopping would accomplish nothing except the cessation of the only activity that justified the continuing expenditure of breath.

And then the letter arrived.

It came not through the Guild's channels — which were, by November, functionally defunct — but through the ordinary post, in a cream-colored envelope addressed in a hand that Veil did not recognize, bearing a postmark from a city he had never visited: Novgorod. Inside was a single sheet of paper on which someone had written, in French of a formal and slightly archaic character:

Monsieur Veil,

Your narrative translations of the suppressed probability maps have reached us through channels that need not be specified. We have read them with interest that we will not attempt to characterize, as the words available to us are insufficient to the purpose.

We write to inform you that the phenomenon you have documented — the systematic elimination of humane futures by algorithmic suppression — is not confined to the Bureau of Temporal Inference, nor to the Consortium of Industrial Interests, nor to the political and economic structures of your timeline.

It is universal.

We are in possession of evidence, gathered over a period that we will describe only as considerable, that equivalent suppression mechanisms exist in every mapped timeline — every probability branch, every alternate configuration of history that the Engine or its equivalents in other realities have charted. In each of these realities, a version of the Harmon Filter operates. In each, a version of the Consortium controls it. In each, the humane futures are eliminated by the same fundamental mechanism: the subordination of calculation to interest, the conversion of possibility into product.

You have exposed a conspiracy in one timeline. We wish to show you that the conspiracy encompasses all timelines. It is not an aberration. It is a structure — woven into the fabric of probability itself, present wherever a future can be calculated and therefore wherever a future can be suppressed.

If you wish to see what we have seen, come to Novgorod. Come alone. Bring the Atlas.

There was no signature. No return address. No indication of who "we" might be or how they had obtained knowledge of events in other timelines — a capability that, as far as Veil understood, did not exist. The Bureau's Inference Engine could calculate probable futures within a single timeline, extrapolating from present conditions along branching paths of causation. But it could not see sideways — could not perceive the parallel timelines that quantum mechanics implied but that no technology had ever confirmed, let alone mapped.

Veil read the letter three times. He set it on his desk beside the Atlas. He looked at the maps on his walls — the palimpsest of suppressed futures, the tidal gardens and reclaimed deserts and closed-cycle industries, the worlds that might have been — and he thought about what it would mean if the letter's claim were true. If the suppression were not local but universal. If every possible version of humanity were being steered, in every possible world, away from the same category of future. If the Harmon Filter were not an invention but a discovery — not something that the Consortium had created but something that the Consortium had found, the way an archaeologist finds a ruin and moves in.

He thought about this for a long time. The November light, gray and provisional, moved across the room's paper landscape like a spotlight searching for something it could not name. In the bookshop below, Montague was speaking to a customer about an eighteenth-century chart of the Caspian Sea — Veil could hear the old man's voice, gentle and precise, describing the cartographer's errors with a tenderness that was also a form of respect, because a map that is wrong about the shape of a coastline is still a record of someone's attempt to describe what they saw, and the attempt, however flawed, retains a dignity that the empty page does not possess.

Veil packed a valise. He placed the Atlas — all four hundred and seventeen pages of it, handwritten on vellum in an ink that was beginning, he noticed, to fade at the edges, as if the futures he had transcribed were already withdrawing from the physical world, retreating into the abstract space where suppressed possibilities go when they are no longer sustained by anyone's attention — into a leather portfolio that Montague had given him, a relic of the old man's own cartographic career, scarred and supple and smelling of journeys.

He left for Novgorod on a Tuesday morning, carrying the Atlas and nothing else of value, because there was nothing else of value, because the Atlas was everything he had and everything he knew and the only map that mattered.

                              II.

The journey took four days by rail, and Veil spent them watching the landscape change outside the window with the attentiveness of a man who has been studying maps for so long that the actual world has become, paradoxically, unfamiliar — a territory whose features he recognized from their representations but had not experienced directly, in their full, unmediated specificity, for longer than he cared to admit.

France gave way to Germany, Germany to Poland, Poland to the vast, flat, snow-dusted expanse of Russia in early winter. The train was old and slow, its rhythms those of a different era of travel — the percussive clatter of wheels on jointed rail, the groan of couplings, the intermittent wail of the whistle at crossings where roads intersected the line at angles that suggested the roads had been there first and the railway had accommodated itself to their precedence. Veil watched the fields pass — stubble fields, harvested and sleeping, the soil dark beneath a scrim of frost — and thought about the probability maps he had studied in which these same fields had been farmed differently, managed for soil health rather than yield, producing less in any given year but producing indefinitely, the agricultural equivalent of a sustainable equilibrium, the kind of future that the Harmon Filter invariably flagged for discard.

He arrived in Novgorod on a Friday evening, stepping from the train into air that was sharp and clean and carried the smell of woodsmoke and frozen earth — smells so old, so fundamental, that they seemed to originate from a stratum of reality that predated and would outlast any possible future, any configuration of probability, any version of the world that a machine might calculate or a consortium might suppress. He found a room in a hotel near the railway station and slept for twelve hours, the deepest sleep he had experienced in months, as if the act of leaving Paris — of leaving the room above the bookshop and its paper walls and its accumulating weight of unrealized worlds — had released him, temporarily, from the obligation to be awake.

In the morning, he went to the address that had been written on the letter's envelope — not as a return address, which had been absent, but as a postmark, which Veil had examined under Montague's magnifying glass and found to contain, embedded in the cancellation stamp's filigree, a street name and number rendered in characters so small that they could only have been placed there deliberately, by someone with access to the postal system's printing apparatus and a confidence in Veil's observational habits that was either flattering or unsettling.

The address led him to a building that might have been a library, or a museum, or a warehouse, or all three — a stone structure of considerable age and ambiguous purpose, its facade decorated with carvings that Veil recognized, after a moment of disoriented study, as maps. Not maps of any geography he knew, but maps of a character he had never seen outside the Bureau: probability topographies, rendered in stone rather than light, their causal threads carved as branching vines, their decision nodes represented as flowers or fruit or, in some cases, eyes — open, watchful, pupilless, gazing out from the stone with an expression that was not quite benevolent and not quite predatory but partook of both, the expression of something that sees everything and judges nothing, which is the most frightening kind of seeing there is.

The door was open.

Veil entered a hall that extended, impossibly, farther than the building's exterior dimensions should have permitted — a space whose proportions obeyed a geometry that was not Euclidean but was not, he suspected, irrational either, merely calculated according to principles that his training had not encompassed. The walls were lined not with glass cabinets, as in the Bureau, but with something more ancient and more intimate: wooden shelves, floor to ceiling, on which rested books — thousands of them, tens of thousands, bound in leather and cloth and materials he could not identify, their spines inscribed with titles in scripts that represented every writing system Veil had ever encountered and several he had not.

And between the shelves, on every available surface, on tables and lecterns and reading stands positioned at intervals that suggested an organizational principle he could not discern, were maps. Probability maps. But not the luminous, three-dimensional projections of the Bureau's Inference Engine — these were hand-drawn, like Veil's own copies, but rendered with a skill and a detail that made his vellum transcriptions look like a child's crayon sketches beside a Renaissance master's preparatory drawings. They were drawn on materials that ranged from paper to parchment to silk to substances he could not name, in inks and pigments that seemed to shift color as he moved past them, as if the maps were responding to his presence, adjusting their representation to accommodate his angle of perception.

At the far end of the hall — which should have been fifty meters away but felt, in the building's elastic geometry, simultaneously near and distant, the way a memory feels when it is both vivid and unreachable — a figure waited.

She was old. Not merely elderly, in the way of someone who has accumulated years within the normal span, but old in a manner that suggested the word "years" was an approximation for a unit of measurement that did not quite apply. She sat in a wooden chair beside a table on which a single map was spread, and she watched Veil approach with eyes that were dark and clear and contained, he realized as he drew near enough to see them properly, a quality of attention that he associated not with living persons but with the probability maps themselves — the impersonal, comprehensive, infinitely patient gaze of a system that has calculated every possible outcome and is waiting, without preference, to see which one the world selects.

"Erasmus Veil," she said. Her French was flawless, accented with something he could not place — not Russian, not any European inflection, but something older, as if the language itself were a map she had learned to read so thoroughly that she had discovered its original cartography, the deep structure beneath the surface of grammar and vocabulary. "The cartographer of lost tomorrows."

"You wrote the letter."

"I arranged for its delivery. The letter was written by a committee, which is why it reads like a committee — formally, cautiously, with insufficient warmth. I apologize for the committee. They are dedicated people, but they have been at this work for a very long time, and long work erodes the personal qualities that make communication a pleasure rather than a transaction."

"Who are you?"

"My name is Anika. I am — the simplest term is curator. I curate this collection." She gestured at the hall, its shelves, its maps, its impossible dimensions. "The collection is an atlas. The atlas is a record of every future that has been calculated and suppressed in every timeline that we have been able to observe. Your narrative translations — your Atlas of Lost Tomorrows — is a contribution to this larger work, and a contribution we value enormously, because it was produced by someone who understood, independently and from first principles, what we have spent a very long time trying to prove: that the suppression is not local."

Veil looked around the hall. The maps, the books, the shelves extending into distances that his eyes insisted were present but his spatial reasoning refused to accept. "How many timelines?" he asked.

Anika's expression did not change, but something shifted in the quality of her attention — a deepening, as if the question had opened a door in the conversation that she had been waiting for him to find.

"All of them," she said. "Every timeline that branches from every decision node in the probability space of the multiverse. We have observed — through means I will explain, though the explanation will take time and will, I warn you, require you to revise several assumptions about the nature of causality that you currently hold as foundational — we have observed the suppression operating in every branch. Every configuration of history. Every version of reality in which a future-calculating mechanism exists. The humane futures are eliminated everywhere, Monsieur Veil. Not by the same people — the Consortium does not exist in every timeline, nor the Bureau, nor the Harmon Filter by that name. But the function is present in every case. The mechanism varies; the outcome does not."

"An enemy in every possible world," Veil said.

"Not an enemy," Anika said. "A tendency. A structural feature of the way consciousness interacts with probability when consciousness is given the tools to calculate futures. The tools create the possibility of selection. Selection creates the possibility of suppression. Suppression creates the conditions for concentration of power. And concentration of power, once established, selects for its own perpetuation — including, and especially, the perpetuation of the selective mechanisms that produced it. The conspiracy you exposed is real, Monsieur Veil. But it was not designed by the Consortium. It was not designed at all. It is an emergent property of the relationship between intelligence and probability. It arises wherever the conditions for it exist, the way crystals arise wherever the conditions for crystallization exist — not because someone decided they should, but because the structure of reality permits them."

Veil was silent. The hall's improbable geometry pressed around him — a space that contained more than it should, that held more futures than any architecture conceived by Euclidean principles could accommodate, that was itself a kind of probability map rendered in stone and wood and paper and the patient, accumulated labor of people who had been fighting this same fight, in timelines he could not name, for longer than he could calculate.

"You are telling me," he said slowly, "that the enemy is not a person or an organization or even a political system. The enemy is a pattern. A recurring structure that appears in every timeline where futures can be computed and therefore controlled."

"Yes."

"And you have gathered, in this building, the evidence of that pattern across — how many realities?"

"More than can be usefully numbered. The atlas grows. It has been growing for — again, the temporal terms are approximate — a very long time."

"To what end? If the pattern is universal — if it arises inevitably wherever the conditions permit — then what is the purpose of documenting it? What is the purpose of fighting something that exists everywhere?"

Anika looked at him with an expression that was, for the first time, recognizably human — not the omniscient gaze of a probability map but the complicated, weary, undimmed regard of a person who has heard this question before, many times, in many languages, from many versions of the same essential interlocutor, and who has not grown tired of answering it, because the answer matters, because the answer is the point.

"The purpose," she said, "is the same as the purpose of your Atlas. The same as the purpose of your vellum copies, your narrative translations, your forty-seven-page document about a future of distributed energy that the Consortium decided the world was not permitted to have. The purpose is to make the invisible visible. To describe what is being hidden. To create, through the act of description, a space in which the suppressed possibility can be apprehended by minds that would otherwise never encounter it."

"But you said the suppression is universal. It exists in every timeline."

"Yes."

"Then so does the resistance. If the pattern of suppression is structural — if it arises wherever the conditions exist — then the pattern of resistance must also be structural. It must also arise wherever the conditions exist."

Anika smiled. It was a real smile, the first he had seen her produce, and it transformed her face in a way that made him revise his estimate of her age — not downward, exactly, but in a direction that the word "age" could not quite follow.

"Now you understand," she said, "why we wrote to you."

                              III.

The atlas occupied three floors of the building — or, more accurately, three strata, since the architecture's relationship to conventional floor plans was approximately the same as a probability map's relationship to a road atlas: structurally analogous but operationally different in ways that became apparent only when you tried to navigate by the wrong set of principles. Veil spent the first week simply walking through the collection, absorbing its scope, learning to read the organizational system that Anika's committee — which she referred to as the Archivists, a name so plain that it could only have been chosen by people for whom the work was too important to dignify with a dramatic title — had imposed on the accumulated records of multiversal suppression.

The system was, he discovered, cartographic. Of course it was. The Archivists organized their collection not by timeline or by chronology or by the nature of the suppressed futures, but by topology — by the shape of the suppression itself, the structural signature that each instance of future-elimination impressed upon the probability space in which it occurred. Each shelf, each section, each stratum of the atlas corresponded to a specific suppression topology, and the maps and narratives within each section documented every observed instance of that topology across the multiverse.

There were, Anika told him, fourteen primary topologies. Fourteen fundamental shapes that the suppression could take, fourteen patterns of how intelligence, given the tools to calculate futures, invariably arranged those tools to serve the concentration of power. The names the Archivists had given them were technical and precise — Convergent Extraction, Distributed Denial, Recursive Capture, Temporal Foreclosure — but Veil, who had spent his career translating abstractions into narratives, found himself translating them again, this time into metaphors that captured not the mechanism but the experience of each topology.

Convergent Extraction was the Harmon Filter — the direct elimination of undesirable futures through algorithmic bias. It was the most common topology, present in approximately eighty percent of observed timelines, and it was also the crudest, relying on the simple expedient of making certain calculations invisible.

Distributed Denial was subtler: a topology in which no single suppression mechanism existed, but in which the calculation of humane futures was distributed across so many competing institutions that no single institution possessed the complete picture, and the incompleteness itself became the instrument of suppression. The future was not hidden; it was fragmented, scattered across bureaucracies and databases and research programs that never communicated with each other, so that the pieces existed but the whole never coalesced. Veil thought of it as a mirror shattered so finely that each shard reflected a piece of the face but no shard reflected the face entire.

Recursive Capture was the topology that disturbed him most. In timelines exhibiting this pattern, the resistance movements themselves — the equivalents of the Cartographers' Guild, the people who had recognized the suppression and organized to oppose it — had been co-opted, their methods and their language absorbed into the very structures they sought to dismantle. The resistance became a feature of the system, a safety valve that created the appearance of opposition without producing the substance of change. The revolutionaries, in these timelines, had been not defeated but digested — metabolized by the machinery of suppression and converted into fuel for its continued operation.

Veil read the accounts with a recognition that was physically nauseating. He saw, in timeline after timeline, the same sequence: the moment of discovery, the thrill of exposure, the brief period of public attention — and then the absorption, the co-option, the slow conversion of resistance into ritual, of protest into performance, of the urgent desire for a different future into a comfortable nostalgia for the desire itself. He saw versions of himself — not literally, not other Erasmus Veils, but people who occupied the same structural position in their timelines' probability space, cartographers of lost tomorrows in all but name — and he saw them celebrated, memorialized, canonized, and neutralized. Their atlases became artifacts. Their narratives became literature. Their resistance became heritage. And the suppression continued.

Temporal Foreclosure was the rarest topology and the most elegant. In a small number of timelines, the suppression operated not by eliminating futures or fragmenting them or co-opting the resistance to them, but by altering the past — reaching backward along causal threads to modify the conditions that would have produced the humane future, so that the future was not suppressed but simply never arose. The timeline experienced no loss, because it had never possessed what was taken. The cartographers in these realities had nothing to map, because the territory they would have mapped had been erased before they were born.

Veil spent three days reading the records of Temporal Foreclosure. When he emerged from the relevant stratum of the atlas, he was pale and quiet, and he sat in the hall's main reading room for an hour without speaking, looking at the stone carvings on the walls — the probability topographies rendered as vines and flowers and watchful, pupilless eyes — and thinking about what it meant to fight an enemy that could erase not only the future but the past that would have produced it.

"It is the topology that produces despair," Anika said, sitting across from him with two cups of tea, one of which she placed before him with the matter-of-fact gentleness of a person who has comforted many visitors after their first encounter with the fourteenth stratum. "Most of the people who abandon the work do so after reading the Temporal Foreclosure records. The other topologies can be fought, or at least opposed. Convergent Extraction can be exposed — you proved that. Distributed Denial can be countered by synthesizing the fragments. Recursive Capture can be recognized and guarded against. But Temporal Foreclosure removes the grounds of opposition itself. It makes the fight not merely impossible but unthinkable, because the thing you would fight for never existed, from the perspective of the altered timeline."

"How do you fight it?" Veil asked.

"You cannot fight it from within the affected timeline. By definition, the people within that timeline do not know what has been taken, because it was taken before they existed. But you can observe it from outside — from other timelines, from the vantage point of the atlas itself, which exists in a space that is not bound to any single probability branch. The atlas remembers what the timelines forget. That is one of its essential functions: to serve as a memory that transcends the mechanisms of forgetting."

"A memory of futures that never happened in realities that may not, from my perspective, exist."

"Yes."

"That is an extraordinarily abstract form of resistance."

"All resistance begins as abstraction, Monsieur Veil. Every revolution was first an idea. Every liberated future was first a description of liberation. Your own work — your vellum copies, your narrative translations — was abstract before it was effective. You described futures that did not exist, and the descriptions created the conditions for people to desire them, and the desire created the conditions for action. The distance between abstraction and effect is shorter than despair suggests."

Veil drank the tea. It was hot and strong and flavored with something he could not identify — an herb, a spice, a substance that existed in the atlas's elastic geography but perhaps not in any single timeline.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked.

"What you have been doing. But more. And differently."

                              IV.

Anika's proposal was this: that Veil extend his Atlas of Lost Tomorrows from a record of suppression within a single timeline to a comprehensive mapping of suppression across the multiverse. That he become not merely a cartographer of his own reality's lost futures but a cartographer of all realities' lost futures — a maker of maps that spanned the probability space entire, documenting the fourteen topologies of suppression in their every manifestation, translating them into narratives that could be read and understood and desired by people in any timeline who possessed the fundamental capacity to imagine a world other than the one they inhabited.

The task was, by any reasonable measure, impossible. The multiverse was infinite. The instances of suppression were infinite. The futures that had been eliminated, fragmented, co-opted, or foreclosed were infinite. No single person, working a single lifetime, could document more than the barest fraction of what the atlas contained.

"Of course," Anika said, when Veil raised this objection with the careful precision of a man who wanted to be convinced but respected himself too much to be convinced cheaply. "The task is impossible. But impossibility is not the same thing as futility. Consider your own work. You copied seventy-three probability maps onto vellum in your apartment above the bookshop. The Bureau had produced thousands. You documented a fraction of a fraction of the suppressed futures in your own timeline. And yet that fraction was sufficient to change the conversation — to create, in the minds of people who read your translations, a space where the possibility of a different future could take root. The effect was disproportionate to the scope. This is always the case with acts of description. You do not need to describe everything. You need to describe enough."

"Enough for what?"

"Enough to create the conditions for recognition. When a person in any timeline reads a description of a suppressed future — even a future from a reality other than their own — something happens. They recognize it. Not as a fact about another world, but as a possibility within their own. The specifics differ; the structure is the same. A reader in a timeline where the suppression takes the form of Distributed Denial reads about a timeline where it takes the form of Convergent Extraction, and they see, in the differences, the shape of the underlying pattern. They see that the suppression is not unique to their experience. They see that it is structural. And that recognition — the recognition of structure — is the beginning of the capacity to resist, because you cannot fight what you cannot see, and you cannot see what you do not have language to describe."

Veil understood. He was a translator. He had always been a translator — converting probability maps into vellum copies, vellum copies into narratives, narratives into the public discourse of a world that had not known what was being taken from it. What Anika proposed was an extension of the same work, scaled to a scope that was admittedly absurd but that was also, he recognized, the logical conclusion of the trajectory he had been following since the morning he had noticed the pattern of discarded futures on his desk in the Bureau.

He had begun by seeing. Then he had begun by recording. Then he had begun by translating. Now he was being asked to begin by connecting — by weaving the isolated instances of seeing and recording and translating that existed in every timeline into a fabric that could be perceived as a whole, a meta-map of the meta-conspiracy, an atlas not of lost tomorrows but of the loss itself, the universal mechanism by which tomorrows were lost and the equally universal impulse by which people, in every conceivable version of reality, refused to accept the loss as final.

"I will need more vellum," he said, and Anika laughed — a sound that was, like her smile, younger than her age and older than her face, a sound that had been produced by many throats in many timelines and that carried, in its harmonics, the accumulated amusement of people who have heard the same joke told by the same essentially decent, essentially stubborn, essentially cartographic soul, arriving independently at the same essential conclusion in timeline after timeline after timeline.

"You will need," she said, "more than vellum."

                              V.

The means by which the Archivists observed other timelines was not a technology in any sense that Veil's training prepared him to understand. It was not a machine, not an algorithm, not a computational system. It was — and here Anika spoke with the deliberate care of a person describing something for which the available vocabulary was inadequate, choosing each word the way a mapmaker chooses each line, knowing that representation is always also distortion — a practice.

"The Engine calculates futures by extrapolating from present conditions along causal threads," she explained. They were in a small room on the second stratum — or the second something; Veil had stopped attempting to map the building's interior by conventional architectural logic — seated at a table on which was spread a probability map unlike any Veil had seen before. It was drawn on a material that felt like paper but behaved like water, its surface shifting and rearranging itself in response to his proximity, the causal threads reorganizing their topology as he moved his hands above the map's surface, as if the map were not a static representation but a living system that was adjusting its display to accommodate his perspective. "The Engine can only see forward, along the timeline it inhabits. It cannot see sideways — cannot perceive the parallel branches of probability that diverge from every decision node. This is a limitation of the Engine's methodology, not of the phenomenon it studies. Probability space is not a line. It is a — the best metaphor is a garden, but a garden in which every plant is also a gardener, and every gardener is also a seed, and every seed contains not a single garden but every garden that could possibly grow from it."

"That is not a very precise metaphor," Veil said.

"No. It is an honest one, which is not the same thing but is, for our purposes, more useful. Precision implies that the thing being described holds still long enough to be measured. Probability space does not hold still. It grows. It branches. It entangles. It generates new configurations faster than any Engine can calculate them, because the Engine's calculations are themselves events within the probability space, generating new branches with every computation. The Engine is both the observer and the observed, the mapmaker and the territory. This is why the Bureau's maps are always incomplete, always provisional, always overtaken by the reality they purport to describe."

"And your practice — your method of observing other timelines — avoids this limitation?"

"It does not avoid it. It embraces it. The practice is based on a principle that the Engine's designers did not consider, because they were engineers and engineers seek to eliminate uncertainty, whereas we are — we have no better word for it — we are readers, and readers seek to inhabit uncertainty, to dwell within the space between what is known and what is possible, and to find, in that dwelling, a kind of perception that is not calculation but recognition."

She showed him. The practice was simple in its outward form and vertiginous in its interior experience. It involved sitting before a probability map — one of the hand-drawn maps in the atlas, representing a suppressed future from any timeline — and reading it. Not analyzing it, not calculating its probability weightings or tracing its causal threads or evaluating its feasibility. Reading it. The way one reads a poem or a face or a landscape at dawn — with attention that is receptive rather than interrogative, that seeks not to extract information but to receive an impression, a quality, a shape.

"When you read a probability map in this way," Anika said, "you are not looking at a representation. You are looking through it — through the specific instance of suppression that the map documents, into the structural pattern that underlies it. And when you perceive the pattern — when you see not this particular suppressed future but the shape of suppression itself — you find that the shape resonates. It echoes. Because the same shape exists in every timeline, and when you perceive it in one, you become capable of perceiving it in others. Not through the map. Through yourself. Through your own capacity to recognize what you are seeing, which is itself a pattern that exists in every timeline, because wherever suppression exists, the capacity to recognize suppression also exists. They are complementary structures. They arise together. They cannot exist without each other."

Veil sat before the map — the living, shifting, water-paper map — and read it.

The experience was unlike anything in his training or his imagination. The map moved. Not in the physical sense of its surface rearranging — though that continued — but in a deeper sense, a structural sense. The causal threads of the depicted future extended outward, beyond the map's edges, beyond the room, beyond the building, beyond the timeline in which Veil sat, and connected to other threads, other maps, other instances of the same essential topology. He saw them. Not with his eyes — his eyes saw only the shifting surface of the map before him — but with a faculty that he had no name for, a capacity for pattern recognition that operated at a level below or above or beside ordinary perception, the way a musician perceives harmony not as a sequence of individual notes but as a single, simultaneous, architectural whole.

He saw the suppression. Not one instance of it — not the Harmon Filter, not the Bureau, not the Consortium — but all instances of it, simultaneously, a vast, branching, endlessly ramifying structure that pervaded the probability space of the multiverse the way mycelium pervades a forest floor: invisible from the surface, immense in extent, connected at every point, and nourished by the very system it inhabited. The suppression was not a conspiracy. It was an ecology. It fed on the futures it eliminated, drawing energy from the gap between what was possible and what was permitted, growing stronger with every future it consumed, extending its reach with every new calculation that a new Engine in a new timeline performed.

And he saw, with equal clarity, the resistance. The Archivists. The Guilds. The cartographers and translators and readers and dreamers in every timeline who had seen the pattern and refused to accept it — who had copied maps onto vellum, who had written narratives of suppressed futures, who had passed coded messages through bookshops and underground presses and whisper networks and samizdat and every other mechanism by which human beings, across the infinite landscape of probability, had found ways to preserve and transmit the knowledge of what was being taken from them. The resistance was also an ecology. Also vast. Also connected. Also nourished by the system it inhabited — because the act of suppression created, as its inevitable byproduct, the conditions for the recognition of suppression, the way a shadow creates the conditions for the perception of light.

Veil sat in the map's shifting presence for an indeterminate period — hours, perhaps, or minutes that contained the density of hours — and when he emerged, he was weeping. Not from grief, though grief was present. Not from joy, though something that resembled joy was present too. He wept from recognition. From the experience of seeing, for the first time, the full scope of what he had been part of — the immensity of the pattern, both the suppression and the resistance, the darkness and the light it produced, the map and the territory and the indissoluble relationship between them.

"Now you see," Anika said.

"I see everything," Veil said, and immediately corrected himself, because precision mattered, because it had always mattered, because the difference between everything and enough was the difference between paralysis and action. "I see enough."

                              VI.

He began the expanded Atlas.

The work was different now — different in scope, different in method, different in the quality of attention it required. Where before he had transcribed individual probability maps, translating specific futures from the Bureau's mathematical notation into the narrative language of human comprehension, he now worked at a higher order of abstraction: mapping not futures but the patterns that governed their suppression, translating not specific timelines but the structural relationships between timelines, creating a cartography not of places but of processes.

He worked in the building in Novgorod, which he came to understand was not precisely in Novgorod — or rather, was in Novgorod in the same way that a probability map is in the glass cabinet that contains it, physically present but dimensionally exceeding its container. The building existed at a point where multiple timelines overlapped, a node in the probability space where the boundaries between realities were thin enough to permit the kind of cross-temporal perception that the Archivists practiced. There were other such nodes, Anika told him — scattered across the geography and the history of every timeline, places where the fabric of causality was permeable, where the echoes of other realities filtered through in the form of intuitions, visions, dreams, stories. Many of the world's sacred sites, she suggested, occupied such nodes. Many of its libraries. Many of its places of refuge.

The Archivists numbered, at any given time, between twelve and thirty — though "at any given time" was itself an approximation, since they operated across timelines and the concept of simultaneity was, in their context, more metaphorical than physical. They came from many realities. They had found their way to the atlas through many paths — some, like Veil, recruited through letters; others arriving on their own, guided by the same pattern of recognition that Anika had described, the structural resonance that led people who had perceived the suppression in their own timeline to seek out evidence of it in others. They were cartographers, librarians, activists, scholars, refugees, and — in a few cases that Veil found both moving and disturbing — former agents of the suppression itself, people who had worked for their timelines' equivalents of the Bureau or the Consortium and who had seen, from the inside, the machinery they served, and who had chosen, at great personal cost, to document what they had seen rather than continue to operate it.

Veil worked among them for three months. He worked with the focused, sustained attention of a man who has found the work he was always meant to do — not merely the transcription of lost futures, which had been his work before, but the synthesis of those transcriptions into a larger pattern, a meta-narrative of suppression and resistance that encompassed not one reality but all realities, not one conspiracy but the universal tendency toward conspiracy that was woven into the structure of consciousness itself.

The new Atlas took shape on his desk — a desk that had been assigned to him in a room on the second stratum, a room whose window overlooked a courtyard that existed in at least four timelines simultaneously and that contained, depending on the angle of observation, a garden or a fountain or a bombed-out crater or a stand of trees that had not grown on Earth. He wrote in the same careful hand he had always used, on the same translucent vellum, with the same iron-gall ink that was beginning, he noticed again, to fade at the edges — a phenomenon that Anika attributed not to chemical degradation but to the inherent instability of descriptions that captured patterns at the boundary of what language could express, the words reaching toward a meaning that lay just beyond their grasp and fading as they stretched.

The Atlas grew. Each section described a topology of suppression — its mechanism, its manifestations across timelines, its effects on the probability space it inhabited, its relationship to the other topologies. But Veil, who had learned in Paris that narratives were more powerful than abstractions, did not merely analyze the patterns. He told stories. He wrote the accounts of individual cartographers in individual timelines — their moments of recognition, their acts of resistance, their defeats and their endurances. He wove these individual narratives into the larger tapestry of the meta-pattern, so that a reader could perceive both the specific and the general, both the tree and the forest, both the particular human being sitting at a desk in a particular city in a particular reality, copying a particular suppressed future onto a particular piece of vellum, and the vast, interconnected, endlessly repeating pattern of which that particular act was one instance among infinite instances, each one unique, each one essential, each one a point of light in a constellation so large that no single perspective could encompass it, but that could be, through the patient work of cartography, made progressively more visible.

He wrote about a woman in a timeline where the suppression took the form of Distributed Denial — a statistician who had spent twenty years assembling, from scattered databases in competing institutions, the fragments of a future that no single institution possessed in its entirety. She had pieced it together the way an archaeologist pieces together a shattered mosaic, tile by tile, inference by inference, until the image emerged: a future of ecological restoration so comprehensive that it would have reversed a century of environmental destruction. The future was not hidden. Every piece of it existed in some database, some report, some archive. But the pieces had been distributed with such thoroughness that no one had ever seen the complete picture — until she assembled it, printed it on a single sheet of paper, and posted it on the door of the Ministry of Environmental Planning, where it remained for eleven minutes before being removed by security, during which time it was photographed by a passing journalist whose article was read by four hundred thousand people before the newspaper's website was shut down by a court order filed by a corporation whose name appeared in the future she had described.

He wrote about a man in a timeline exhibiting Recursive Capture — an activist who had recognized that his own movement had been co-opted, that the language of resistance he used had been absorbed into the marketing vocabulary of the very institutions he opposed, that his protests were being incorporated into the spectacle of dissent that served, paradoxically, to stabilize the system he sought to destabilize. He had responded by inventing a new language — not a code, not a cipher, but a genuinely new vocabulary, generated by a process of deliberate estrangement that forced his listeners to hear familiar ideas as if for the first time, stripped of the associations that had been weaponized against them. The new language was awkward, difficult, resistant to casual consumption — which was, he argued, the point. "If you can sell it," he said, in words that Veil translated with the care of a man handling something both fragile and explosive, "they will buy it. And if they buy it, they own it. And if they own it, it is no longer yours. So make something that cannot be sold. Make something that requires effort to understand. Make something that demands participation rather than consumption. That is the only language that the machinery of capture cannot digest."

He wrote about a child in a timeline where Temporal Foreclosure had been applied — a girl of nine who had drawn, on the back of a school worksheet, a picture of a city she had never seen, with buildings that curved like flowers and streets that followed the paths of rivers and a sky that was full of things that were not birds and not aircraft but something between the two, something that had no name in her vocabulary or anyone else's, because the future in which such things existed had been erased from her timeline before she was born. She had drawn it from a dream. The dream had come from the echo of a probability thread that the Foreclosure had not quite succeeded in eliminating — a remnant, a ghost, a causal whisper that had survived the erasure and found its way, through the permeable boundary between what was and what might have been, into the sleeping mind of a child who had no framework for understanding what she was seeing but who recognized, with the unerring instinct of a consciousness encountering a suppressed possibility, that the picture she was drawing was important. That it mattered. That it was a map of something real.

Veil wrote these stories and hundreds more. He wrote them with the same precision he had brought to his vellum copies and the same passion he had discovered in his narrative translations, combining the cartographer's commitment to accuracy with the storyteller's commitment to meaning, producing documents that were both records and arguments, both maps and manifestos, both descriptions of what had been taken and invocations of what might yet be recovered.

And as he wrote, the Atlas grew, and as the Atlas grew, it began to do what Anika had predicted — what Veil himself had predicted, in his conversation with Gerald Harmon in the Bureau's interior room, fourteen months and an infinity of probability branches ago. It began to spread.

                              VII.

The distribution was the Archivists' work, and it was executed with a meticulousness that Veil, as a fellow practitioner of careful systems, admired enormously. The Atlas could not be distributed as a physical object — it was too large, too fragile, too dependent on the specific materials and conditions of the building in Novgorod for its full dimensionality to survive conventional reproduction. But its contents could be extracted, translated, and transmitted in the same way that Veil had originally translated the Bureau's probability maps: as narratives. Stories. Descriptions of suppressed futures rendered in language that any literate person in any timeline could read and understand.

The Archivists maintained networks in dozens of timelines — some through nodes like the building in Novgorod, some through the permeable boundaries that Anika had described, some through methods that Veil did not fully understand and that the Archivists themselves described with a candor about their own uncertainty that he found both admirable and alarming. The narratives were transmitted through these networks and emerged, in their destination timelines, in the forms appropriate to those realities: as books, as pamphlets, as oral traditions, as songs, as coded messages in the margins of other texts, as dreams, as stories told by grandmothers to grandchildren in the language of myth, as scientific papers published in obscure journals whose readership was small but whose readers were precisely the people most likely to recognize the pattern and act upon the recognition.

Veil contributed to this distribution by writing the narratives, but also by training others to write them. The Archivists' committee, for all their dedication, were not natural storytellers — they were researchers, analysts, cataloguers, people whose skills lay in the accumulation and organization of evidence rather than its translation into the language of desire. Veil taught them what he had learned in his apartment above the bookshop: that a narrative is not a report, that a story about a suppressed future must make the reader want that future, must create in the reader's imagination a space that is shaped like the missing thing, a hunger that is also a compass pointing toward the direction from which the missing thing might, with effort and luck and the stubborn refusal to accept its absence as permanent, eventually arrive.

He taught them about specificity — that a description of "a sustainable future" moved no one, but a description of a specific garden in a specific city, where a specific woman grew specific vegetables in soil that had been rendered fertile by a specific process of ecological restoration, moved everyone, because human beings do not desire abstractions, they desire the particular, the concrete, the thing they can see and touch and taste and smell, and the task of the narrative translator is to provide that particularity even when — especially when — the thing being described does not yet exist.

He taught them about honesty — that the narratives must not conceal the difficulty of the futures they described, must not pretend that sustainable equilibrium was the same as paradise, must not erase the conflicts and compromises and imperfections that any real future would contain. A narrative that promised perfection was a narrative that the reader would correctly distrust, because perfection was not a feature of any calculated future — not even the most stable, not even TI-7823-omega with its three-century projection horizon. The futures were better, not perfect. They were more equitable, not equal. They were more sustainable, not eternal. And the narratives had to reflect this, because honesty was not merely an ethical obligation but a strategic one: a narrative that was honest about the limitations of the future it described was a narrative that the reader could believe, and belief was the necessary precondition for desire, and desire was the necessary precondition for action.

He taught them about beauty — that the narratives must be, in themselves, beautiful, because beauty was a form of argument that operated below the threshold of rational evaluation, bypassing the defenses that the suppression erected in the form of cynicism and resignation and the carefully cultivated belief that nothing could change. A beautiful sentence about a future of distributed energy did not merely describe the future; it enacted it, in miniature, in the reader's mind. The experience of beauty was the experience of a world organized according to principles that were not those of extraction and accumulation but those of grace and sufficiency, and the reader who experienced that beauty would carry it with them as a standard against which the actual world could be measured and found wanting.

He taught them these things, and they taught him others. They taught him the history of the atlas — its origins in a timeline so distant from his own that the differences were not merely political or technological but physical, the laws of nature themselves varying in ways that made translation a matter not merely of language but of ontology. They taught him the practice of cross-temporal reading, refining his initial experience with the shifting map into a sustained capacity for perceiving the patterns that connected timelines, the structural resonances that made the multiverse not a chaos of disconnected realities but a vast, interconnected probability space in which every event echoed in every other event, attenuated by distance and interference but never entirely silenced.

And they taught him — or rather, they confirmed what he had already begun to suspect — that the struggle he was engaged in had no endpoint. The suppression was structural. It would not be defeated in the way that a political movement defeats an opposing political movement, by the accumulation of power sufficient to impose a new arrangement. It could only be resisted — continuously, patiently, in every timeline, in every generation, by every consciousness that perceived the pattern and chose, in the face of its universality, to describe what was being hidden rather than accept the hiding as the natural order of things.

"This is the hardest thing," Anika said, on an evening when Veil had been working for sixteen hours and the Atlas's growing weight — both physical and metaphysical — was pressing on him with a force that he could not distinguish from exhaustion. "Not the scope of the task. Not the power of the opposition. Not the knowledge that the suppression exists in every timeline and will arise again wherever the conditions permit. The hardest thing is the knowledge that the resistance must also exist in every timeline and must also arise again, and that this means the struggle is never over. There is no victory. There is no final state of liberation after which the work can stop. There is only the ongoing practice of making the invisible visible, which must be renewed in every generation, in every reality, by every person who sees what is hidden and refuses to look away."

"That is not victory," Veil said.

"No. It is something else. Something that your language does not have a precise word for — though your poets have circled it, and your philosophers have described its shadow, and your cartographers — the real cartographers, the ones who draw maps not of territories but of possibilities — have always known it even if they could not name it. It is the condition of engaged resistance without the expectation of final resolution. It is the practice of hope without the promise of fulfillment. It is — and I offer this not as a definition but as a direction, a bearing on a compass that points toward a meaning that lies beyond the horizon of what I can articulate — it is the act of making maps of places that do not yet exist, in the faith that the act of mapping is itself a form of creation, and that the creation, however incomplete, however provisional, however far from the territory it represents, is nevertheless real, and good, and necessary."

Veil considered this. He thought about the morning in his office at the Bureau when he had noticed the pattern of discarded futures — the hundred and twelve maps, the systematic elimination of humane timelines, the moment when his incuriosity had cracked and the light of recognition had flooded in. He thought about the vellum copies in the wooden chest, the narrative translations, the forty-seven-page document that had changed a parliamentary committee's agenda. He thought about Lena Deschamps, detained in an undisclosed location, her fate unknown. He thought about Montague, the old bookshop proprietor, describing an eighteenth-century cartographer's errors with tenderness. He thought about the child in the Temporal Foreclosure timeline, drawing a city she had never seen from a dream she could not explain.

He thought about all the cartographers of lost tomorrows, in all the timelines, in all the realities — the vast, branching, endlessly diverse community of people who had perceived the suppression and had responded not with despair but with description. Who had picked up pens, brushes, instruments of inscription in every conceivable medium, and had begun the work of making visible the futures that someone — the pattern, the structure, the emergent property of consciousness interacting with probability — had decided should remain invisible.

"I understand," he said. And then, because he was a precise man, and because precision was a form of love: "I understand enough."

                              VIII.

The Atlas of Unborn Futures — as Veil now titled the expanded work, distinguishing it from the earlier Atlas of Lost Tomorrows by a change of adjective that reflected a change of understanding, the futures being not merely lost, which implied they had once been found, but unborn, which implied they had never yet existed but still might — reached, by the end of his fifth month in Novgorod, a size and complexity that challenged the physical medium of its creation.

Four hundred pages of vellum became six hundred, then eight hundred, then a thousand, each page covered in Veil's careful hand, the iron-gall ink fading at the edges in that characteristic way that he had ceased to think of as degradation and had begun to think of as a feature — the words reaching toward their referents and thinning as they stretched, the way light thins at the edges of a lamp's circle, the way music thins at the boundaries of audibility, the way love thins at the limits of expression without ever quite disappearing, because the thing that is being reached for is real even when the reaching cannot quite arrive.

He organized the Atlas according to the fourteen topologies but structured each section as a narrative rather than an analysis, telling the story of the suppression through the stories of the people who had encountered it and the futures they had attempted to preserve. The effect was cumulative: each story was, in itself, a small thing — a cartographer, a statistician, a child, an activist, a defector, each one occupying a specific position in a specific timeline and perceiving, from that position, a specific instance of the universal pattern — but taken together, read in sequence, experienced as a whole, the stories produced in the reader a recognition that was greater than the sum of its parts, a perception of the pattern itself, the suppression-and-resistance that pervaded the probability space of the multiverse like a gravitational field, invisible but inescapable, shaping every trajectory within its influence.

And within this vast structure, Veil embedded something else — something he did not discuss with Anika or the committee or anyone, because it was his own contribution, his own extension of the work, born from his own understanding of what maps were for and what stories could do.

He embedded the futures themselves.

Not as abstractions — not as descriptions of "sustainable equilibrium" or "distributed energy" or any of the other generalities that the Bureau's classification system preferred. He embedded them as places. As worlds. As fully realized, densely detailed, sensually present environments that a reader could enter and inhabit, if only for the duration of a paragraph, if only for the time it took to read a sentence about the smell of rain on reclaimed soil or the sound of wind turbines in a desert that had been restored to grassland or the taste of water drawn from a river that was clean because someone, in some version of reality, had decided that clean rivers were more important than the profits that polluted them.

He wrote these passages with everything he had — with the cartographer's precision and the storyteller's passion and the lover's attention to the specific, the irreplaceable, the quality of light in a particular room at a particular hour in a particular world that did not yet exist but that could, that had been calculated and suppressed and erased but not destroyed, because the description survived, because the map survived, because the story survived, and the story was a seed, and a seed is an argument against extinction that the future itself must eventually adjudicate.

The passages accumulated in the Atlas like islands emerging from a sea of analysis, each one a small, vivid, self-contained world nested within the larger structure of the meta-narrative. A reader moving through the Atlas would encounter them at intervals — the analytical sections describing the mechanisms of suppression, the narrative sections describing the people who had perceived and resisted it, and then, suddenly, without transition, a passage that was neither analysis nor narrative but pure description, a window opening onto a future that someone had decided should not exist, rendered in language so precise and so beautiful that the reader, for a moment, believed in it. Not as a probability. Not as a calculation. As a place. As a home.

Veil understood, as he wrote these passages, that he was doing something that the Bureau's probability maps had never been designed to do and that the Archivists' analytical frameworks could not accomplish. He was creating desire. Not the abstract desire for "a better future" — which was a sentiment so general as to be meaningless, a slogan that could be printed on a banner and waved at a rally and forgotten by evening — but the specific, aching, bodily desire for this particular garden in this particular city, this particular dawn over this particular restored landscape, this particular child's laughter in this particular school built from materials that would last three hundred years because the people who built it had decided that three hundred years was not too long to plan for.

The desire was the weapon. Not the analysis, which could be dismissed. Not the evidence, which could be suppressed. Not the argument, which could be co-opted. The desire — the raw, specific, undeniable wanting of a particular future that the reader could see and smell and taste and hear — that was the thing that the suppression could not eliminate, because desire, once created, lived in the body, in the nervous system, in the dreaming mind, in the stubborn, irrational, magnificently physical insistence of a living consciousness that the world could be different from what it was.

He wrote and wrote and wrote. The Atlas grew. The ink faded at the edges. The vellum accumulated on his desk like sedimentary layers, each page a stratum of possibility deposited by the patient, ongoing, never-concluded process of a man who had decided that the act of description was the most radical act available to him and who practiced it with the devotion of a monk and the precision of an engineer and the passion of a lover writing letters to a beloved who had not yet been born.

                              IX.

In the sixth month, the Consortium found the building.

Not the Consortium of Veil's timeline — that organization, as far as the Archivists could determine, had no knowledge of the node in Novgorod or the cross-temporal capabilities it permitted. The Consortium that found them was from a neighboring timeline, one in which the suppression had advanced further than in Veil's reality, one in which the equivalent of the Bureau controlled not merely the calculation of futures but the communication of information about futures, maintaining a monopoly on temporal knowledge that was enforced by mechanisms considerably more direct than administrative erasure.

They arrived not as people but as an influence — a distortion in the probability space surrounding the building, a warping of the causal threads that the Archivists' maps depicted, as if a massive gravitational object had been placed nearby and was bending the trajectories of everything within its field. The maps on the walls began to change. Not dramatically — the shifts were subtle, incremental, the kind of changes that would be invisible to anyone who was not reading them with the sustained, disciplined attention that the Archivists practiced — but they changed. Causal threads that had pointed toward humane outcomes began to curve, bending toward configurations that favored concentration, extraction, control. Decision nodes that had been open — balanced between multiple possible outcomes — began to close, narrowing toward single paths that the Archivists recognized as the signature of Convergent Extraction applied not to a single timeline but to the node itself, the point of cross-temporal overlap that made the atlas possible.

Anika recognized the attack for what it was immediately. "They are trying to foreclose the node," she told Veil, her voice carrying a calm that was not serenity but discipline — the controlled composure of a person who has rehearsed for this eventuality and is now executing the rehearsed response with the same methodical precision she brought to everything else. "If they succeed, the probability space surrounding this building will collapse into a single timeline — theirs — and the cross-temporal permeability that allows the atlas to function will be sealed. We will not be destroyed. We will be isolated. Each of us returned to our own timeline, our connections to the atlas and to each other severed, the work continuing in each reality but without the meta-perspective that the atlas provides."

"Can it be prevented?"

"It can be resisted. The same way everything can be resisted. By making the invisible visible. By describing what is happening. By refusing to accept the narrowing of possibility as natural or inevitable."

The Archivists mobilized. Their response was not physical — they had no weapons, no defensive technology, no means of direct confrontation with an influence that operated on the level of probability itself. Their response was cartographic. They mapped the attack. They documented the warping of causal threads, the closing of decision nodes, the progressive narrowing of the probability space around the building. They translated these observations into narratives and transmitted them through the networks, so that the people in the destination timelines would know what was happening, would understand the nature of the threat, would recognize — if and when the node was closed and the atlas fell silent — that the silence was not natural but imposed, and that the work of the atlas must continue in isolation until such time as a new node could be found or an old one reopened.

Veil worked through the crisis with the sustained concentration that had characterized his entire tenure at the atlas. He did not stop writing. He did not revise his methods or his priorities. He understood, with a clarity that felt like the final setting of a bone that had been broken and improperly healed and was now, at last, aligned, that the crisis did not change the nature of the work. The work was always the same: describe what is hidden, make visible what is suppressed, create in the minds of readers a space where the possibility of a different future can take root. Whether the context was a quiet office in the Bureau, a room above a bookshop in Paris, a building in Novgorod under attack from a neighboring timeline's Consortium, or a solitary desk in a world where the atlas had been silenced and the networks severed and every connection to the larger pattern lost — the work was the same. The pen. The vellum. The careful, precise, loving act of description.

He wrote faster. Not carelessly — never carelessly — but with an urgency that compressed his already dense prose into passages of extraordinary intensity, sentences that wound through subordinate clauses and parenthetical observations and recursive self-qualifications with the desperate, beautiful, Baroque energy of a man who knows that the window is closing and is determined to pass through it as much of the truth as the window's remaining aperture will permit.

He wrote about the attack itself — translating the Archivists' cartographic observations into narrative, describing the warping of probability in language that a reader who had never seen a probability map could nevertheless feel, the way one feels a change in atmospheric pressure before a storm, the sense of something vast and invisible pressing against the membrane of the perceptible world.

He wrote about the Archivists — their calm, their discipline, their refusal to panic, their methodical execution of protocols designed for exactly this contingency, the beauty of competence exercised under duress.

He wrote about Anika — who stood in the main hall, surrounded by the stone carvings of probability topographies, reading the shifting maps with the attention of a conductor listening to an orchestra, perceiving dissonances that others could not hear, making adjustments to the Archivists' response with the small, precise gestures of a person whose authority was not imposed but emergent, the natural consequence of being the person who saw most clearly what needed to be done.

And he wrote about the futures. The unborn futures. The tidal gardens and the reclaimed deserts and the closed-cycle industries and the clean rivers and the schools built to last three centuries. He wrote about them with an intensity that bordered on prayer, because prayer is what description becomes when the describer knows that the thing being described is in danger of being lost, and the writing is the only force available to prevent the loss, and the force is insufficient but is also the only force there is, which makes it, by default and by necessity, enough.

                              X.

The node held.

Not because the Archivists defeated the attack — the concept of defeat was inapplicable to a conflict conducted at the level of probability manipulation, where outcomes were not binary but spectral, not won or lost but tilted, inflected, nudged along the continuum between the fully open and the fully closed. The node held because the Archivists' response — the mapping, the documenting, the narrating, the transmitting — created a counter-pressure in the probability space, an influence that resisted the narrowing by asserting the breadth, the way a person holding a door open against a closing force does not defeat the force but maintains, through sustained effort, the space that the force is attempting to eliminate.

The attack subsided over a period of weeks, the probability distortions gradually attenuating, the causal threads resuming their normal configurations, the decision nodes reopening to their characteristic multiplicity. The neighboring timeline's Consortium had not abandoned its objective — the Archivists had no illusion about that — but it had, for the moment, redirected its resources, the way a siege army withdraws to resupply, and the respite, however temporary, was real.

Veil used the respite to complete the Atlas.

He had understood, during the crisis, something that changed the final structure of the work. He had understood that the Atlas could not be a finished object. It could not be a book with a final page, a map with defined borders, a narrative with a conclusion. The suppression was ongoing; therefore the resistance must be ongoing. The futures were being eliminated continuously, in every timeline, in every moment; therefore the documentation of those futures must also be continuous. An Atlas that reached a conclusion would be an Atlas that had accepted the premise of finality — the premise that the struggle could be resolved, one way or another, and that the document recording it could be closed and shelved and consigned to the category of completed work.

The Atlas, to be true to its subject, must be incomplete. Must be, in perpetuity, a work in progress. Must contain, alongside its descriptions of suppressed futures and its analyses of suppression topologies and its narratives of resistance, an explicit acknowledgment that it was not finished, could not be finished, and that its incompleteness was not a failure but a feature — the textual equivalent of the ongoing practice that Anika had described, the engaged resistance without the expectation of final resolution, the hope without the promise of fulfillment.

He wrote the final section — which was not a final section but a bridge, a passage leading from the work he had done to the work that would be done by others, in other timelines, in other rooms, at other desks, with other pens and other inks and other materials, continuing the Atlas's endless project of making the invisible visible and the suppressed desirable and the unborn futures present, at least in the mind, at least in the imagination, at least in the small, persistent, inextinguishable space where description and desire converge and produce, from their convergence, the conditions for the possibility of change.

He wrote:

The atlas you hold — if it can be said to be held, given that it exists in multiple copies, in multiple timelines, in multiple forms that range from vellum manuscript to oral tradition to dream — is not a record of what has been lost. It is a map of what has not yet been found.

The futures it describes are not dead. They are unborn. They exist in the probability space of the multiverse as potentials — calculated, evaluated, and suppressed by mechanisms that vary in their specifics but share a common structure: the subordination of possibility to interest, the narrowing of the future to serve the present arrangements of power. These mechanisms are real. They are powerful. They are, in the technical sense, universal — present in every timeline where futures can be calculated and therefore controlled.

But the futures are also real. They exist as calculations, as descriptions, as stories, as images in the minds of people who have read this atlas or heard its contents or dreamed its dreams. They exist as desires — specific, concrete, embodied desires for specific gardens, specific rivers, specific schools, specific mornings in specific cities where the air is clean and the water is safe and the buildings are designed to last and the children are not afraid. These desires are as real as the mechanisms that suppress them. They are as powerful. They are as universal.

The atlas does not end here. It continues in every act of description that makes a suppressed future visible. It continues in every narrative that translates a probability map into a story that a human being can desire. It continues in every child who draws a city she has never seen, in every statistician who assembles fragments into a picture of what could be, in every activist who invents a language that cannot be bought, in every cartographer who picks up a pen and begins the ancient, radical, necessary work of mapping a territory that does not yet exist.

You are the atlas now. You, the reader, the listener, the dreamer. The work is yours.

Make it beautiful. Make it honest. Make it specific. Make it a place that someone could want to live.

And then: describe it. To anyone who will listen. In any medium that will carry the words. With whatever ink remains.

The lost tomorrows are waiting. They have always been waiting. They will wait as long as necessary — which is to say, forever, or until someone describes them so precisely and so beautifully that the world, recognizing itself in the description, chooses to become what it has always had the potential to be.

This is the atlas of unborn futures. It is unfinished. It will always be unfinished.

That is its promise.

                              * * *

Veil set down his pen. The ink on the final page — if it could be called a final page, given that it was explicitly a bridge to pages not yet written — was wet and dark at the center of each word and fading, already, at the edges, the iron-gall thinning toward transparency, the words reaching toward their referents with the tender, insufficient, indomitable gesture of a hand extended toward something beautiful that is almost but not quite within reach.

The room was quiet. Outside the window that overlooked the courtyard of four timelines, snow was falling — or rain was falling, or sunlight was falling, or ash was falling, depending on which reality's weather prevailed at that particular angle of observation. The light in the room was the light of late afternoon in November, gray and golden simultaneously, the color of a day that is ending and a day that is beginning, which are, from the perspective of someone who has spent six months mapping the probability space of the multiverse, the same color.

He gathered the pages of the Atlas — all one thousand and sixty-three of them, handwritten on vellum in fading iron-gall ink, organized by the fourteen topologies of suppression and populated with the stories of cartographers and statisticians and children and activists and defectors and dreamers from timelines beyond counting — and placed them in the leather portfolio that Montague had given him, the old cartographer's case that smelled of journeys and contained, now, a journey vaster than anything its original owner could have imagined.

He would take the Atlas back to Paris. He would continue the distribution. He would write new sections as new suppressed futures were discovered and new acts of resistance were documented. He would teach others to write them. He would train translators and narrative cartographers and storytellers in every timeline the networks could reach. He would do this until he could not do it anymore — until the ink ran out or the vellum ran out or the body that moved the pen across the page ran out — and then someone else would continue, because the work was not his, had never been his, was not any single person's but was instead a collective, distributed, endlessly renewed practice of seeing and saying and refusing to be silent.

He stood. He walked through the hall, past the shelves of books and maps, past the stone carvings with their pupilless watchful eyes, past the tables where the Archivists worked their patient, endless, necessary labor. Anika was in her chair at the far end, reading a map, her attention the attention of a person who has been looking at the same thing for a very long time and still finds, in each looking, something she has not seen before.

"I am going back," Veil said.

"Yes," she said. "The networks need you in Paris. The atlas needs to be in the world, not in the archive. That has always been its purpose — not to be kept but to be given away, not to be preserved but to be used, to be read, to be translated, to be argued about and revised and extended and contradicted and loved."

"Will I return here?"

"Perhaps. The node is stable for now, but stability is not permanence, and the suppression is patient. If the node closes, you will continue the work in your own timeline, alone if necessary, without the meta-perspective that the atlas provides. You will be a cartographer of a single reality's lost tomorrows, which is where you began. The circle will close. But the closing of a circle is not the same as the ending of a line. A circle continues."

Veil looked at the old woman — the curator, the archivist, the reader of probability maps, the keeper of an atlas that spanned the multiverse and was always, deliberately, beautifully, necessarily unfinished.

"Thank you," he said, because gratitude, like precision, was a form of love, and love, like description, was a form of resistance, and resistance, in the end, was the only form of hope that was honest enough to be worth practicing.

Anika nodded. "Go well, Erasmus Veil. Map what you see. Describe what is hidden. Write beautifully. Write honestly. Write as if the futures you describe are real, because they are. Write as if the act of writing can change the world, because it can. Write as if the ink will last, even though it fades. Especially because it fades."

He walked out of the building, into the November air of Novgorod — or of every Novgorod, every city, every place where a person had ever stepped out of a doorway carrying something they had written and hoping, against the evidence of the world's vast indifference, that the writing mattered. The snow fell around him, white and quiet and impartial, covering the streets and the rooftops and the probability space of the multiverse with a temporary, luminous, soon-to-be-erased blanket of white — a blank page, a fresh vellum, a surface on which anything might be written, any future described, any lost tomorrow recovered from the archive of suppression and restored to the atlas of possibility.

He carried the portfolio under his arm. The Atlas of Unborn Futures, unfinished and unfinishable, pressed against his side like a heartbeat, like a promise, like a map of everywhere he had not yet been.

The train station was three blocks away. The journey home was four days. The work was forever.

Veil walked toward the station. The snow fell. The futures waited.

They were patient. They had all the time in the world.

                          THE SEED VAULT

                       by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                              I.

The last grove of Garry oaks on the Pacific coast died on a Tuesday in October, and Dr. Maren Isaacson recorded it the way she recorded everything now: with precision, without sentiment, and in a hand so steady that anyone reading her field notebook would have had no reason to suspect that the woman holding the pen was watching the final act of an extinction she had spent twenty years trying to prevent.

She stood at the edge of what had been, eighteen months ago, a stand of ninety-three trees — Quercus garryana, native to the coastal lowlands from British Columbia to central California, evolved over twelve thousand years of post-glacial colonization, adapted to the specific conditions of maritime climate and seasonal drought that had prevailed along the northeastern Pacific littoral since the retreat of the Cordilleran ice sheet. Now it was a stand of ninety-three skeletons. The bark had separated from the cambium in long, papery strips that curled outward like the pages of a book left open in the rain. The leaves — such as remained — were not merely dead but structurally altered, their cellular architecture collapsed by the cascading failure of photosynthetic chemistry that the mycologists were calling, with the grim precision of scientists who had run out of euphemisms, terminal chloroplast syndrome.

Terminal chloroplast syndrome. As if the chloroplasts had made a decision. As if the organelles responsible for converting sunlight into sugar — organelles that had been performing this function, with variations, for two and a half billion years, since the first cyanobacterium swallowed the first photosynthetic prokaryote and transformed the atmosphere of the planet — had simply decided, one Tuesday in October, to stop.

They had not decided. They had been poisoned. The mechanism was complex, involving a cascade of atmospheric chemistry interactions that the research teams were still unraveling, but the proximate cause was simple enough: the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the lower troposphere had reached a threshold at which the gas penetrated stomatal openings and reacted with the water in mesophyll cells to form sulfurous acid, which degraded the thylakoid membranes of the chloroplasts, which disrupted the electron transport chain, which terminated photosynthesis. The trees starved in sunlight. They stood in open air, bathed in the photons that had powered their metabolism for millennia, and they could not use them. The light fell on their leaves and passed through like light through glass, unconverted, unharvested, wasted.

Maren recorded the GPS coordinates of the last living tree — which was not, properly speaking, living, but was dying more slowly than the others, its inner bark still showing faint traces of chlorophyll activity, a remnant of metabolic function that the sulfurous acid had not yet reached, a candle flame in a wind that was not gusting but was steady and was not going to stop. She recorded the tree's diameter at breast height, its approximate crown spread, the condition of its root flare. She collected samples: bark, cambium, sapwood, a terminal branch with three leaves still attached, each leaf the color of old parchment, the veins standing out like the ribs of a collapsed building.

She sealed the samples in labeled containers and placed them in the insulated case she carried on her back — a case that had been designed for transporting biological specimens across difficult terrain and that now served, she reflected, as a kind of portable reliquary, each sample a relic of a species in the process of becoming memory.

Then she walked to the edge of the grove and looked west, toward the ocean, which was visible from the bluff as a line of gray-green below a sky that was the color of sulfur dioxide — not yellow, exactly, but tinged, as if someone had mixed a small amount of something corrosive into the blue.

The ocean was dying too, of course. The acidification had crossed the threshold for aragonite saturation three years ago, and the calcifying organisms — the corals, the mollusks, the foraminifera that formed the base of marine food webs — were dissolving. Not dramatically, not in the way that a Hollywood film would depict dissolution, with spectacular collapses and visible disintegration. Quietly. The shells grew thinner. The coral skeletons became brittle. The planktonic foraminifera, each one smaller than a grain of sand, each one a microscopic architect building a calcium carbonate test of extraordinary geometric precision, produced tests that were incomplete, malformed, insufficient to protect the organism within. They died by the billions, invisibly, at the bottom of the water column, and the fish that fed on the organisms that fed on them died too, and the marine mammals that fed on the fish died too, and the seabirds that fed on everything died too, and the beach below the bluff where Maren stood was littered with the bodies of common murres that had starved in a sea that looked, from the surface, unchanged.

Maren turned away from the ocean and began the walk back to the Vault.

                              * * *

The Seed Vault occupied a decommissioned military installation on the Olympic Peninsula — a concrete bunker built during the Cold War to withstand a nuclear detonation and subsequently abandoned, sold to the Department of Agriculture at surplus prices, converted into a research facility, de-funded, re-funded, de-funded again, and finally, in the desperate final years of the ecological crisis, repurposed as what its official designation called a Genetic Preservation Repository and what everyone who worked there called, simply, the Vault.

It was, Maren sometimes thought, the most important building in the world. It was also the loneliest.

The Vault contained seeds. Not the domesticated cultivars that the Svalbard Global Seed Vault in Norway had been designed to protect — the wheats and rices and sorghums of human agriculture, the crop species that civilization depended on — but the wild species. The uncultivated, undomesticated, economically valueless species that no agricultural program had any reason to preserve: the native grasses and forbs and shrubs and trees that had constituted the botanical architecture of the North American continent before the architecture began to collapse.

Maren had spent the last six years collecting them. She and her team — which had started as twelve people and was now three, the others having been reassigned or defunded or, in two cases, simply unable to continue work that consisted of documenting the death of everything they loved — had traveled the length and breadth of the western states, from the alpine meadows of the Cascades to the desert floors of the Great Basin, collecting seeds from every species they could find in viable populations, processing them according to the protocols of orthodox seed banking — cleaning, drying, testing for germination viability, sealing in laminated aluminum packets, cataloguing, storing at minus eighteen degrees Celsius — and adding them to the Vault's growing collection.

The collection now numbered fourteen thousand, six hundred and twelve species. It represented, by Maren's estimate, approximately sixty-three percent of the native vascular plant flora of western North America.

It was not enough. It would never be enough. The flora was dying faster than they could collect it, the atmospheric chemistry degrading the photosynthetic capacity of species across every habitat type simultaneously, the extinction rate accelerating along a curve that Maren's colleague, a biostatistician named Paul Oshiro, had plotted on a graph that he kept pinned above his desk and that he no longer updated because the curve had exceeded the vertical axis of his graph paper and he could not bring himself to start a new graph with a scale that accommodated the numbers he was seeing.

But the collection was something. It was a record. A repository. A library of genetic information encoded in the ancient, elegant, four-letter alphabet of DNA, each seed a book written in nucleotides, each book containing the instructions for building a plant — a specific plant, adapted to specific conditions, carrying in its genome the accumulated wisdom of millions of years of evolution, the solutions to problems of drought and cold and heat and disease and competition and symbiosis that no human engineer could have designed and that no human technology could reproduce.

The seeds would not be planted. Maren understood this with a clarity that she did not discuss with her remaining team members, because the clarity was not useful and the discussion would not be productive. The atmospheric degradation was irreversible on any timescale relevant to human civilization. The sulfur dioxide would persist for centuries. The ocean acidification would persist for millennia. The cascading extinctions that were currently reducing the planet's biodiversity to levels not seen since the Permian-Triassic boundary — the Great Dying, two hundred and fifty million years ago, when ninety-six percent of marine species and seventy percent of terrestrial vertebrate species had perished — would continue until they reached their own equilibrium, which would be an equilibrium of absence, a world simplified to the few species hardy enough to survive in an atmosphere and an ocean that had been chemically reconfigured by two centuries of industrial combustion.

The seeds in the Vault would not grow in that world. They were adapted to conditions that no longer existed and would not return in any foreseeable future. They were, in the most literal sense, seeds of the past — genetic blueprints for plants that required a planet that was gone.

But they contained information. And information, unlike organisms, did not require specific atmospheric conditions to persist. The DNA in a properly stored seed could remain viable for centuries — in some cases, millennia. The information encoded in that DNA — the genetic recipes for photosynthetic pigments, cell wall structures, root architectures, symbiotic relationships with soil microorganisms, chemical defenses against herbivores, reproductive strategies, growth patterns, dormancy mechanisms — all of it would survive, locked in the crystalline molecular structure of deoxyribonucleic acid, waiting.

Waiting for what?

Maren did not know. She was a botanist, not a prophet. She could not predict what kind of civilization — human or otherwise — might eventually develop the capacity to read the Vault's genetic library and extract from it the knowledge needed to rebuild a functioning ecology. She could not predict whether such a civilization would arise, or when, or whether it would be wise enough to use the knowledge differently than her own civilization had used the planet's original endowment.

But she could preserve the information. She could maintain the Vault. She could continue the work of collection and cataloguing and storage, adding species to the archive with the same careful attention to protocol and procedure that she had always practiced, the discipline of good science applied to an enterprise that had, by any rational assessment, no practical purpose and no reasonable expectation of success.

She did it anyway. She did it the way the Garry oaks had photosynthesized — because it was what she was built to do, and the fact that the conditions for its success were disappearing did not alter the fundamental nature of the activity, only the meaning assigned to it by observers whose definition of meaning required the expectation of outcome.

                              II.

The Vault's interior was cold and clean and smelled of the mineral neutrality that characterized environments from which organic processes had been deliberately excluded. Maren passed through the airlock — a double-doored vestibule designed to maintain the storage chambers' atmospheric isolation — and entered the main corridor, a concrete tunnel lined with shelving units that extended, under fluorescent light, for ninety meters.

On the shelves, in laminated aluminum packets arranged by taxonomic family and cross-referenced by ecosystem of origin, the seeds waited. Fourteen thousand, six hundred and twelve species. Each packet labeled in Maren's handwriting — genus, species, collection date, collection site, GPS coordinates, habitat description, germination viability percentage, number of seeds per packet. Each label a miniature epitaph for a population that was, in most cases, no longer extant in the wild.

She walked the corridor slowly, as she often did in the evenings, not inspecting — the environmental monitoring systems handled that, tracking temperature and humidity and atmospheric composition with a precision that exceeded her own senses — but visiting. Paying attention. Acknowledging.

Asteraceae. The sunflower family. Forty-seven species in the collection, from Balsamorhiza sagittata — arrowleaf balsamroot, the great yellow-flowered forb of the intermountain grasslands, each flower head a composite of hundreds of individual florets arranged in a spiral pattern that conformed to the Fibonacci sequence — to Wyethia mollis — woolly mule's ears, a plant so precisely adapted to the volcanic soils of the Modoc Plateau that it could not grow anywhere else, a specialist in a habitat that was now, according to Paul's data, functionally dead.

Fabaceae. The legume family. Sixty-one species. The nitrogen-fixers, the soil builders, the species that maintained the chemical fertility of ecosystems through their symbiotic relationship with Rhizobium bacteria — the tiny, nodule-dwelling microorganisms that converted atmospheric nitrogen into forms that plants could use, a metabolic partnership that had been sustaining terrestrial ecosystems for four hundred million years and that was now, in the wild, being disrupted by the same atmospheric chemistry cascade that was killing the chloroplasts.

Pinaceae. The pine family. Thirty-three species. Pinus longaeva — bristlecone pine, the oldest living organisms on Earth, some individuals in the White Mountains of California more than four thousand years old, their annual growth rings a climate record stretching back to the Bronze Age, each ring a chapter in the atmospheric history of the Northern Hemisphere — trees that had survived ice ages and droughts and volcanic winters and every other perturbation that the planet's climate system had produced over four millennia, and that were now dying, because the perturbation that industrial civilization had introduced was of a kind and a magnitude that four thousand years of evolutionary resilience could not accommodate.

Maren paused before the Pinaceae section. She placed her hand on the shelf, feeling the cold aluminum beneath her fingers, and thought about the bristlecone pine seeds sealed inside the packets — each seed the size of a grain of rice, each one containing the genetic instructions for building an organism that could live for four thousand years, each one carrying in its DNA the accumulated adaptive wisdom of a lineage that extended back sixty million years to the forests of the late Cretaceous, the world of the dinosaurs, the warm, carbon-rich atmosphere that had produced the first pines and that was now, in a terrible irony that only a species capable of irony could appreciate, being replicated by the burning of the fossilized remains of those same Cretaceous forests.

She removed her hand from the shelf and continued walking.

Paul was in the monitoring room at the end of the corridor, sitting before the bank of instruments that tracked the Vault's environmental conditions. He looked up when Maren entered, and his face carried the expression she had come to associate with bad news, which was not an expression of distress but of carefully maintained neutrality — the face of a man who had learned that the most dangerous response to bad news was the one that acknowledged its emotional impact, because the emotional impact, once acknowledged, had a tendency to become the dominant reality, displacing the practical questions that still required answers.

"The monitoring stations in the Klamath Basin are offline," he said. "All six. Satellite imagery suggests the valley is burning."

Maren sat down. The Klamath Basin was — had been — one of their most productive collection sites, a region of extraordinary botanical diversity at the intersection of three biogeographic provinces, its marshes and meadows and oak woodlands supporting an assemblage of species found nowhere else on the continent.

"How many species did we collect from the Klamath?"

"Eighty-seven confirmed. Another thirty-one targeted for next season's expedition."

"Next season" was a figure of speech. They both knew that next season's expedition would not occur, because the funding for next season had been redirected to the emergency atmospheric remediation program — a program that Maren and Paul and everyone in the ecological sciences understood was futile, a gesture of institutional desperation aimed at a problem that had passed the threshold of remediation three decades ago but that politicians preferred to address with expensive, visible, ineffective technology rather than with the admission that the situation was, in the technical sense of the word, hopeless.

"We have the eighty-seven," Maren said.

"We have the eighty-seven."

They sat in the monitoring room, in the clean cold air, surrounded by the instruments that measured the conditions of a vault that protected the genetic heritage of a continent, and they did not speak about the thirty-one species that would now die without any record of their genetic information being preserved, because speaking about it would not preserve them and would consume time and emotional energy that were better spent on the species that could still be saved — that could still be collected, dried, tested, sealed, labeled, stored, and maintained in the crystalline patience of minus eighteen degrees Celsius, waiting for a future that might not come but that could not come at all if the information was lost.

"The Sequoia team called in," Paul said. "They collected viable seeds from the last stand of Sequoiadendron giganteum in the southern Sierra. Seventeen trees. Germination viability looks good."

Giant sequoia. The largest organisms on the planet by volume — trees that could reach heights of eighty meters and girths that required twenty people, arms outstretched, to encircle. Trees that had been growing in the Sierra Nevada for two million years, since the Pleistocene, since before humans existed, since before the genus Homo had diverged from its australopithecine ancestors. Trees that had survived the ice ages by retreating to sheltered groves on the western slopes, where the maritime influence of the Pacific moderated the continental climate and the snowpack fed the deep soil moisture that the sequoias required.

Seventeen trees. From a species that had once numbered in the millions.

"Good," Maren said. "Add them to the collection."

                              III.

The question of purpose haunted the Vault like a draft in a hallway — not visible, not always noticed, but always present, a persistent coolness that no amount of insulation could entirely exclude.

Maren confronted it directly only once, in a conversation with the Vault's remaining team member, a young seed technologist named Rin Kawasaki, who had joined the project three years ago with the bright, ferocious energy of someone who still believed that the work could make a difference in the present tense, and who was now, at twenty-eight, beginning to understand that the present tense was not the tense in which the Vault operated.

They were processing the giant sequoia seeds — cleaning them in the airflow cabinet, testing subsamples for germination on moist filter paper, calculating the number of seeds required for a genetically representative sample, sealing the remainder in the laminated packets. It was detailed, meticulous work, and Rin performed it with the focused competence that Maren had come to value more than any other quality in a colleague, the ability to do careful work in the knowledge that the work's ultimate purpose was uncertain.

"Who is this for?" Rin asked, not looking up from the germination test. Her voice was neutral, inquiring — the voice of someone asking a genuine question, not making a rhetorical point. "The seeds. The Vault. All of it. Who do we think is going to use this?"

Maren considered the question. She could have answered with the official justification — the Department of Agriculture's language about "preserving genetic resources for future restoration ecology" — but the official justification was a fiction, a bureaucratic narrative constructed to secure funding from legislators who required the pretense of practical utility as a condition of appropriation. She could have answered with the scientific justification — the argument that genetic information had intrinsic value, that the loss of a genome was the loss of evolutionary knowledge accumulated over millions of years, that preservation was an ethical obligation independent of practical application — but the scientific justification, while true, did not answer Rin's question, which was not about ethics but about audience. Who would open these packets? Who would read these genetic texts? Who would have the knowledge and the technology and the ecological conditions necessary to translate the information in these seeds back into living plants?

"I don't know," Maren said. "I don't know who. I don't know when. I don't know whether they'll be human, or what kind of civilization they'll have, or whether they'll understand what we've given them."

"Then why do we do it?"

Maren sealed a packet of sequoia seeds. She labeled it in her careful hand: Sequoiadendron giganteum. Southern Sierra Nevada, Tulare County, California. Elevation 1,890 meters. Collection date: September 2nd. Seventeen source trees. Germination viability: 84%. Seeds per packet: 4,200.

"Because the information is real," she said. "The DNA in these seeds is a record of how to build a giant sequoia — every protein, every enzyme, every regulatory sequence, every solution to every problem that the species encountered over two million years of evolution. That information exists nowhere else. When the last tree dies, the only copy of that record will be in this vault. And if we don't preserve it, it's gone. Not just for us. For everyone who comes after. For every civilization that might arise on this planet in the next million years. Gone."

"But we can't know that anyone will come after."

"No. We can't know. But we can know that if no one preserves the information, there will be nothing for them to find. The question isn't whether someone will use these seeds. The question is whether we're willing to foreclose the possibility that someone might."

Rin was quiet for a while, testing germination rates, recording data, performing the careful, repetitive tasks that constituted the daily work of the Vault. Then she said:

"It's an act of faith."

"No," Maren said. "Faith requires belief. This requires only the recognition that the future is not ours to determine. We don't get to decide whether these seeds are used. We only get to decide whether they're available. The rest is not our business."

She was not, she knew, entirely truthful. There was faith in it — not the faith of religion, which claims knowledge of what it cannot see, but a deeper, older, more biological faith, the faith of the seed itself, which contains within its coat the complete instructions for an organism it has never been and a world it has never inhabited, and which waits, in darkness, in cold, in the suspended animation of desiccation, for conditions it cannot predict and may never experience, and which does not, in any meaningful sense, hope — because hope requires consciousness, and a seed is not conscious — but which persists, which endures, which maintains its molecular integrity through decades and centuries of dormancy, and which would, if conditions returned, germinate. Would split its coat. Would send a root downward and a shoot upward. Would begin, again, the ancient process of converting light into life.

The seeds in the Vault were doing what seeds had always done. They were waiting. The only difference was that the conditions for which they waited were no longer approaching on any trajectory that Maren could calculate. The conditions were gone. The world that had produced them was gone. And yet the seeds persisted, in their laminated packets, at minus eighteen degrees, their DNA intact, their genetic instructions complete, their potential for germination preserved against a future that Maren could not see and could not predict and could not justify believing in and refused, absolutely and irrevocably, to foreclose.

                              IV.

The autumn deepened. The atmospheric monitoring data grew worse. Paul's graphs — the ones he had stopped updating because the numbers exceeded his graph paper — would have required, had he continued plotting them, a logarithmic scale. The sulfur dioxide concentrations in the lower troposphere were not merely rising; they were accelerating, driven by feedback loops that the atmospheric chemists described with the terse, controlled alarm of people who had predicted exactly this trajectory ten years ago and had been ignored, and who were now watching their predictions arrive on schedule with the horrified satisfaction of prophets whose accuracy brought no comfort.

The extinctions accelerated in parallel. Each week brought reports of species that had been lost — not endangered, not threatened, not declining, but gone. Eliminated from the biosphere with the finality of a word erased from a manuscript. The American chestnut, which had survived the blight of the early twentieth century in a handful of resistant individuals, succumbed to the chloroplast syndrome. The California condor, which had been rescued from extinction by a captive breeding program of heroic dedication and expense, died in its breeding facility when the atmospheric contamination penetrated the ventilation system. The Joshua tree, icon of the Mojave, emblem of the American desert, died standing, its fibrous trunk too resilient to collapse but its metabolic processes too disrupted to sustain, a monument to its own extinction.

Maren collected seeds. She drove the Vault's remaining vehicle — a battered four-wheel-drive truck that had once been white and was now the color of the landscapes it traveled through, dust-colored, ash-colored, the color of endings — across the degraded terrain of the Pacific Northwest, visiting the remnant populations that her surveys had identified, collecting seeds from species that would be extinct within months, processing them in the field with portable equipment, bringing them back to the Vault and adding them to the shelves.

Each trip was a journey through a landscape in the process of becoming something else. The forests were dying. Not selectively — not this species or that species, not the vulnerable or the marginal or the already-stressed — but comprehensively, across all species, all ages, all conditions of health. The chloroplast syndrome did not discriminate. It attacked the photosynthetic machinery that all green plants shared, the molecular apparatus that had been conserved, with minor variations, across a billion years of evolutionary divergence. A mechanism that had been universal in its distribution was now universal in its vulnerability.

The roads Maren drove were lined with dead trees. Standing dead, mostly — the trunks still upright, the branches still extended, the silhouettes against the sulfurous sky still recognizably those of Douglas firs, western red cedars, Sitka spruces, the great conifers of the Pacific coastal forest. But the green was gone. The needles had fallen or faded to brown or bleached to the pale, papery white of exhausted chlorophyll. The forest floor, which had always been dark — shaded by the canopy, damp with the perpetual moisture of the maritime climate — was now exposed to light that fell unfiltered through the naked crowns, and the mosses and ferns and shade-loving herbs that had carpeted the ground were dying too, their own photosynthesis disrupted by the same atmospheric chemistry that was killing the trees above them.

It was, Maren thought, the most thorough destruction she had ever witnessed. More thorough than fire, which killed selectively and left seed banks in the soil. More thorough than logging, which removed the trees but left the understory and the soil organisms intact. More thorough than disease, which targeted specific taxa and left others to fill the vacated niches. This was total. This was the elimination of the metabolic process that made terrestrial plant life possible. This was the end of photosynthesis.

She collected seeds from the last viable populations she could find. A grove of Pacific silver fir on a north-facing slope where the atmospheric contamination had not yet reached lethal concentrations. A meadow of native bunchgrasses in a valley sheltered by ridgelines that created a local atmospheric circulation pattern, drawing cleaner air down from altitude. A single specimen of Calochortus tolmiei — Tolmie's star-tulip, a delicate, white-flowered lily of the mountain meadows — growing in a crevice in a basalt outcrop, its bulb protected by the rock, its single flower open to the tainted sky with what Maren could not help interpreting, despite her scientific discipline, as defiance.

She collected the star-tulip's seeds — four of them, contained in a single capsule — and held them in her palm. Four seeds. Each one three millimeters long. Each one containing the complete genetic instructions for a plant that had been growing in the meadows of the Pacific Northwest for six million years. Each one representing, in the compressed, encoded language of DNA, a solution to the problem of how to be alive in a specific place, under specific conditions, in a specific relationship with specific soils and specific pollinators and specific fungi and specific seasons and specific qualities of light.

Four seeds. The entire future of the species, if it had a future, resting in Maren's palm like four grains of sand that happened to contain the blueprint for a flower.

She sealed them in a packet. She labeled the packet. She drove back to the Vault and placed the packet on the shelf, between Calochortus subalpinus and Calochortus uniflorus, in its proper taxonomic position, in its proper place in the ordered archive of everything that was being lost.

                              V.

Winter came early that year, and with it a silence that was new — not the silence of snow, which was soft and absorptive and muffled the world in white, but a deeper silence, a biological silence, the absence of the sounds that living ecosystems produce and that the ear, accustomed to them, registers only when they stop.

No birdsong. The passerines — the thrushes and warblers and sparrows and wrens that had filled the Pacific Northwest forests with a continuous, layered, astonishingly complex acoustic environment — were gone. Starved by the collapse of insect populations, which had been caused by the collapse of plant populations, which had been caused by the atmospheric chemistry. The chain of causation was simple and remorseless: kill the plants, and you kill the insects that eat the plants, and the birds that eat the insects, and the mammals that eat the seeds, and the predators that eat the mammals, and the fungi that decompose the dead, and the bacteria that cycle the nutrients, and the entire interlocking, interdependent, four-billion-year-old system that constituted life on the surface of the planet.

No wind in trees. The dead forests stood motionless, their naked branches too rigid to sway, their absence of foliage denying the wind the surfaces against which it had produced, for millions of years, the susurrant, rushing, infinitely varied sound of air moving through leaves. The wind still blew. But it blew through a landscape that could not respond to it, and the silence was the silence of a musical instrument with no strings.

Maren worked in the Vault. The collection had reached fourteen thousand, nine hundred and three species. She had added two hundred and ninety-one species in the final collection season, working alone for the last six weeks after Paul had been reassigned to the atmospheric remediation program and Rin had left — not for another position but simply left, unable to continue, her face when she said goodbye carrying the expression of someone who has reached the limit of what discipline can sustain and who is not ashamed of the limit but has no choice except to honor it.

Maren was alone in the Vault. Alone with fourteen thousand, nine hundred and three species. Alone with the genetic heritage of a continent, sealed in aluminum packets, stored at minus eighteen degrees, maintained by systems that would continue to function — the solar panels, the backup generators, the automated environmental controls — for decades after the last human being left the facility.

She thought about this. She thought about the Vault continuing to exist, the shelves intact, the packets sealed, the temperature steady, the DNA preserved in its crystalline molecular architecture, year after year, decade after decade, in a building that no one visited, in a landscape that no one inhabited, on a continent that was reverting to the condition it had occupied before the first photosynthetic organisms colonized the land surface four hundred and seventy million years ago — a sterile, mineral, ultraviolet-blasted expanse of rock and water, beautiful in its way, austere in its chemistry, patient in its geological processes, and empty of everything that the seeds in the Vault remembered how to build.

She thought about this, and she did not despair.

Not because she was optimistic. Maren Isaacson had never been optimistic. She was a scientist, and the data did not support optimism. But she understood something that optimism did not require and that despair could not refute: that the act of preservation was meaningful independent of its outcome. That maintaining the Vault — the daily work of environmental monitoring, equipment maintenance, inventory verification, the small, meticulous, invisible acts of custodianship that kept fourteen thousand, nine hundred and three species' genetic information intact and accessible — was a good in itself. Not because it would lead to restoration. Not because it guaranteed a future in which the seeds would germinate. But because the alternative — allowing the information to be lost, permitting the extinction to be total, accepting that the genetic record of a continent's botanical heritage could be erased as casually as a line of text — was a form of complicity with the destruction, and Maren refused to be complicit.

She was the custodian. The keeper. The last botanist in the last vault on a dying continent, preserving seeds that would not germinate for anyone she would ever know, maintaining a library that might not be read for centuries, tending an archive that addressed itself not to the present — which was lost — or to the near future — which would be worse — but to the deep future, the future measured in geological time, the future in which the atmosphere might clear and the oceans might recover and the conditions for photosynthesis might return and some civilization, human or otherwise, might find the Vault and open it and read the genetic texts inside and understand what they contained and have the wisdom and the technology and the will to use them.

That future might not come. The seeds might wait forever in their laminated packets, their DNA slowly degrading despite the cold, the molecular bonds breaking one by one over the millennia until the information was gone, the last copy of the last record of the last forest erased by the simple, irreversible, thermodynamically inevitable process of entropy.

But they might not. The DNA might hold. The Vault might endure. The future might arrive.

And if it did — if, in some century so remote that Maren could not imagine it, some intelligence opened the door of the Vault and found the shelves intact and the packets sealed and the seeds inside still carrying, in their molecular architecture, the complete genetic instructions for fourteen thousand, nine hundred and three species of plants adapted to conditions that no longer existed but that might, with knowledge and effort and the slow, patient work of ecological restoration, exist again — then the act of preservation would have been, retroactively, the most important thing that any human being had ever done.

Not because it saved the world. But because it kept the possibility of saving the world from being destroyed along with everything else.

Maren sealed the last packet of the season. She labeled it. She placed it on the shelf.

The Vault was quiet. The fluorescent lights hummed. The cold air held its steady minus eighteen degrees, preserving, with the mindless, reliable, amoral precision of physics, the genetic heritage of a world that was ending.

Outside, the snow fell on a silent landscape. Inside, the seeds waited.

They were patient. They had been patient for millions of years. They could be patient for millions more.

================================================================================

                        ACCOUNTANT OF SOULS

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                              I.

The intake queue stretched from the Evaluation Desk to the Anteroom of Initial Assessment, which was a distance of approximately two hundred yards, and Arthur Cribb had been standing in it for what he estimated, based on the position of his feet relative to the baseboard and the rate at which the queue appeared to move, was fourteen hours.

He was dead. He had determined this with reasonable confidence approximately nine hours ago, when the woman standing behind him in the queue — a stout, irritable person named Mrs. Gladys Hatchett who had, she informed him without being asked, died of a cerebral hemorrhage while watching the evening news — had pointed out that the overhead fluorescent lighting did not cast shadows, that the air in the corridor had no temperature, and that neither of them had needed to use the bathroom since their arrival, all of which she considered conclusive evidence that they were no longer operating within the biological parameters of the living.

Arthur had accepted this information with the equanimity of a man who had spent thirty-one years working as an accounts clerk for the Municipal Water Authority and who had, in that time, developed a relationship with institutional bureaucracy so intimate and so long-suffering that discovering he was dead and standing in a processing queue for the afterlife produced in him not shock or terror or existential anguish but a weary, familiar recognition, the feeling of a commuter arriving at yet another government office and finding, with perfect predictability, a line.

The corridor was institutional in every particular. The walls were painted in a shade of green that Arthur recognized — with the instinctive precision of a man who had spent three decades in municipal buildings — as Federal Standard 595a, color 34258, a matte finish chosen for its ability to convey authority without cheerfulness. The floor was linoleum, patterned in a vaguely geometric design that recalled nothing so much as the floor of the Department of Motor Vehicles office on Broad Street, where Arthur had renewed his driver's license every four years with the same sense of mild, formalized suffering that he was now experiencing in the afterlife. The fluorescent lights buzzed. Somewhere ahead, a typewriter was clacking — not a modern electric typewriter but a manual, its keystrikes sharp and irregular, the sound of someone working at a pace determined by the machine's mechanics rather than the operator's ambition.

At the head of the queue, visible through the doorway of the Evaluation Desk room, sat a man in a gray suit. He was neither old nor young, neither tall nor short, neither handsome nor plain. He possessed the specific, cultivated averageness of a person who had been selected for his role precisely because he would not be remembered, a face designed to process rather than to impress, the human equivalent of the green walls and the linoleum floor.

Arthur reached the front of the queue at approximately the fifteenth hour. The man in the gray suit looked up from his desk — a standard government-issue metal desk, its surface covered with forms and rubber stamps and a cup of pencils — and said, in a voice calibrated to convey official cordiality without personal warmth:

"Name?"

"Arthur Cribb."

"Date of death?"

"I'm not entirely certain. Yesterday, I think. Or possibly this morning. I was eating breakfast."

"Cause?"

"I don't know. I was eating oatmeal and then I was here."

The man in the gray suit made a note on a form. "Cardiac event. Very common. Age?"

"Fifty-eight."

"Occupation?"

"Accounts clerk, Municipal Water Authority."

The man in the gray suit looked up from his form, and for a moment — a very brief moment, quickly suppressed — something that might have been interest flickered across his aggressively unremarkable features. "Accounts?"

"Accounts receivable, primarily. Some payroll. Some budgeting."

"You work with numbers."

"I have for thirty-one years."

"Ledgers?"

"Ledgers, spreadsheets, receipt books, disbursement forms, reconciliation statements. The full range."

The man in the gray suit set down his pencil. He looked at Arthur with an attention that was out of keeping with the assembly-line rhythm of the intake process, the way a foreman on a production line might pause when a part came through that was different from the others — not defective, exactly, but possessing some quality that warranted a second look.

"Mr. Cribb," he said. "How would you describe your relationship with accuracy?"

Arthur considered this. It was not a question he had been asked before, in life or in death, but it was a question he felt qualified to answer. "I have never submitted an inaccurate ledger," he said. "In thirty-one years. Not once."

"Never?"

"Never. I have caught errors, of course. My own and others'. But I have never allowed an error to pass uncorrected into the final record. I consider it — I considered it — a matter of professional responsibility."

The man in the gray suit stood up. "Come with me, please," he said. "There's someone who would like to speak with you."

                              * * *

The someone was a woman named Ms. Persimmon, who occupied an office on the fourth floor of the building — for it was a building, Arthur realized as they ascended in an elevator whose mechanical sounds were indistinguishable from those of the elevator in the Municipal Water Authority headquarters, the same creaking cables, the same hydraulic whine, the same slight hesitation before the doors opened, as if the machine were pausing to collect itself before admitting its passengers to another floor of identical corridors and identical green walls and identical fluorescent lighting.

Ms. Persimmon's office was different. Not in its furniture, which was the same government-issue metal desk and filing cabinets and wooden visitor's chair. Not in its paint, which was the same Federal Standard 595a green. But in its atmosphere, which carried a quality of density — of accumulated work, accumulated decisions, accumulated time — that Arthur recognized from long experience with offices in which someone was actually doing something, as opposed to the more common offices in which someone was performing the simulation of doing something.

Ms. Persimmon was a Black woman of perhaps forty-five, with close-cropped hair and reading glasses that she wore on a chain around her neck and that she put on and took off with a frequency that suggested they were not merely functional but gestural — a way of punctuating her thoughts, a physical analogue to the pauses and emphases of her speech. Her desk was covered with files — actual paper files, manila folders stuffed with forms and documents, stacked in piles that appeared chaotic but that, Arthur's trained eye discerned, were organized according to a system whose logic, while not immediately apparent, was clearly present.

"Mr. Cribb," she said. "Sit down. I'm going to tell you something, and I need you to listen carefully, because what I'm about to describe is a problem, and I believe you may be the person who can help me solve it."

Arthur sat.

"How much do you know about the administrative structure of the afterlife?"

"Nothing."

"Good. People who think they know are usually wrong, and their wrongness gets in the way. Here is the short version. The afterlife is administered. It has been administered since — well, since the beginning, whenever that was, which is a question the theology department handles and which I, as a practical matter, do not need to answer. The administration is organized into departments. Intake, which you've just come through. Evaluation, which determines the disposition of each soul based on criteria that are above my clearance level. Assignment, which routes each soul to its appropriate destination based on the evaluation results. And Accounting, which is my department, and which is responsible for maintaining the records of every soul that has been processed — every intake, every evaluation, every assignment — since the system was established."

"That must be a great many records," Arthur said.

Ms. Persimmon took off her glasses, then put them back on. "Mr. Cribb, the system has been processing souls for approximately two hundred thousand years, which is roughly the span of anatomically modern human existence. The average processing volume is approximately one hundred and eight billion souls to date. Each soul generates a minimum of fourteen forms across the intake, evaluation, and assignment pipeline. That is approximately one and a half trillion individual records."

Arthur absorbed this number with the professional calm of a man who had once reconciled the Municipal Water Authority's accounts for a fiscal year in which the city council had changed the budget format three times, the payroll system had crashed twice, and someone in the engineering department had been submitting expense reports in Roman numerals.

"I assume you have a filing system," he said.

"We have seventeen filing systems, accumulated over two hundred millennia of administrative evolution, none of which are fully compatible with the others, several of which use classification schemes that were obsolete before the invention of writing, and one of which — the oldest — appears to be organized according to a principle that no one in the current department can identify, explain, or reproduce."

"That sounds familiar."

"I thought it might." Ms. Persimmon leaned forward. "Mr. Cribb, six months ago — in afterlife administrative time, which is not the same as living time but which serves as a useful approximation — I discovered an anomaly. A discrepancy in the records. A number that did not match."

Arthur leaned forward too. This was his language now. This was terrain he knew.

"In the course of a routine reconciliation between the Intake Department's processing logs and the Assignment Department's disposition records, I found that the numbers did not agree. More souls were being processed through intake than were being received at their assigned destinations."

"Souls were going missing?"

"Souls were being misrouted. Sent to the wrong destination. Not a few. Not a rounding error. A systematic, persistent discrepancy that, when I traced it backward through the records, extended at least eight hundred years, and possibly much longer."

"How many?"

Ms. Persimmon took off her glasses. She did not put them back on. "At minimum, based on the records I have been able to access, four million. But the discrepancy has a recurring character that suggests a periodic error in the routing algorithm — an error that occurs at regular intervals and has been occurring, undetected, for a very long time. If the period extends as far back as the oldest incomprehensible filing system — and I have reason to believe it does — the total number of misrouted souls could be in the hundreds of millions."

The office was very quiet. The fluorescent lights hummed. Somewhere in the building, the manual typewriter clacked its irregular rhythm.

"Where were they sent?" Arthur asked.

"That is the question," Ms. Persimmon said. "And that is why I need an accountant."

                              II.

They began with the records.

Arthur had worked with bad records before — incomplete records, contradictory records, records kept in formats that had been superseded so many times that the original data was buried under layers of translation like an archaeological tell. But the afterlife's accounting system was bad records elevated to an art form, a masterpiece of administrative dysfunction accumulated over a span of time that made the Municipal Water Authority's thirty-one years of institutional entropy look like a single afternoon of mild disorganization.

The seventeen filing systems were the beginning of the problem, not the end. Within each system, the records had been maintained with varying degrees of care by caseworkers who had ranged, over the millennia, from meticulous to careless to actively negligent to, in at least one case that Arthur identified in the third week of his investigation, apparently non-existent — a caseworker who appeared in the personnel records but who had not, as far as Arthur could determine from the evidence, ever processed a single soul, maintaining a payroll presence in the department for fourteen centuries without producing any work product whatsoever, a feat of bureaucratic camouflage that Arthur found simultaneously appalling and, in a very specific professional sense, impressive.

Ms. Persimmon gave him access to the files — physical files, stored in a basement that extended downward for a distance that Arthur declined to estimate — and he set to work with the tools he had always used: a pencil, a ruled notebook, and the systematic, plodding, unglamorous method of checking every number against every other number until the discrepancies revealed their pattern.

The work took months. Arthur did not mind. He had never minded work that was slow and detailed and required patience. He had always understood, in a way that people who valued speed and inspiration over accuracy and persistence did not, that the most important quality in an accountant was not brilliance but stamina — the willingness to sit with numbers until the numbers told you what they knew, which they always did, eventually, if you were patient enough and careful enough and honest enough to accept what they were saying even when what they were saying was something you did not want to hear.

What the numbers said was this:

Approximately every sixty-two years, the afterlife's routing system experienced what Arthur came to think of as a skip — a brief, systematic error that diverted a percentage of incoming souls from their evaluated destinations to an alternate destination that did not appear in any of the system's official routing tables. The skip lasted approximately four hours, affected approximately one in every twelve hundred souls processed during that window, and then corrected itself, leaving no trace in the system's automated logs — because the logs, Arthur eventually determined, were designed to record only the routing designations that appeared in the official tables, and the alternate destination did not appear in the official tables, and therefore the log recorded nothing, the bureaucratic equivalent of a tree falling in a forest with no one to hear it.

The souls diverted during each skip were not randomly selected. The routing error targeted a specific category: souls whose evaluations placed them in the borderline range between two adjacent destinations — souls whose assignment was, in the system's own terminology, ambiguous. These were the cases that required judgment, that could reasonably go either way, that the evaluation criteria did not resolve cleanly. They were the difficult cases. The close calls. The ones that a careful caseworker would flag for review and a careless caseworker would assign arbitrarily and that the system's automated routing, during its periodic skip, sent neither to the one destination nor the other but to a third destination that the system did not acknowledge existed.

Arthur documented this. He filled notebooks with his careful, ruled columns of numbers — dates, processing volumes, skip windows, diversion rates, soul identification codes. He cross-referenced the diverted souls' evaluation scores and confirmed the pattern: all borderline, all ambiguous, all the cases in which the difference between one destination and another came down to the exercise of mercy — the willingness to interpret the criteria generously, to give the benefit of the doubt, to acknowledge that a life lived in the murky territory between virtue and vice deserved consideration rather than mechanical assignment.

The system's skip removed precisely these cases from the possibility of mercy. It took the ambiguous souls — the ones who most needed a human being to look at their files and make a compassionate judgment — and sent them to a destination where no one looked at anything, where the assignment was automatic, where the determining factor was not the quality of the life lived but the accident of timing, the misfortune of dying during a four-hour window that occurred every sixty-two years.

Arthur brought his findings to Ms. Persimmon. She read his notebooks with the concentrated attention of a woman who had suspected something terrible and was now seeing it confirmed in the irrefutable language of numbers.

"Where are they being sent?" she asked.

Arthur opened his notebook to the page where he had documented the alternate routing designation — a code that did not appear in any official table but that he had extracted, through a process of deduction that had required him to reconstruct the logic of the oldest, most incomprehensible filing system, from the pattern of absences in the records.

"I don't know what the designation means," he said. "But I know its code. And I know that the souls routed to this destination are never re-routed, never reviewed, never audited. They enter the designation and they do not leave it. There is no record of their arrival. No record of their processing. No record of anything at all. They simply — stop appearing in the system."

"A dead end," Ms. Persimmon said. "In a system designed to process the dead."

"Yes."

She put on her glasses. She took them off. She put them on again. "Mr. Cribb, do you know what happens to a soul that the system loses?"

"No."

"Neither does anyone else. That is the problem. The system was designed with the assumption that every soul would be accounted for — that the records would be complete, that the routing would be accurate, that no soul would pass through the pipeline without being processed and assigned and documented. The system has no protocol for lost souls because the system was not designed to lose them."

"But it is losing them."

"It has been losing them for at least eight hundred years. Probably much longer. Hundreds of millions of souls, sent to a destination that doesn't exist in the records, processed by no one, assigned to nowhere, existing in a condition that the system's designers did not anticipate and that the system's administrators do not understand."

Arthur looked at his notebooks. Pages and pages of numbers, each column a record of loss, each row a soul that had been diverted from the possibility of mercy into the certainty of bureaucratic oblivion.

"What do you want to do?" he asked.

"I want to find them," Ms. Persimmon said. "And I want to bring them back into the system and give them the evaluations they were supposed to receive — the careful, individual, merciful evaluations that the system owes every soul and that these souls, through no fault of their own, were denied."

"That would require reviewing hundreds of millions of cases."

"Yes."

"It would take — I cannot calculate how long it would take. The processing capacity of the department is already stretched. The backlog of current cases is —"

"Mr. Cribb." Ms. Persimmon's voice was quiet, but it carried a weight that silenced him — not the weight of authority, which he would have recognized and resisted, but the weight of conviction, which was different, and which he found, to his own surprise, persuasive. "I have been working in this department for a very long time. I have processed more souls than I can count. I have followed the procedures, applied the criteria, made the assignments. I have been accurate and I have been diligent and I have been, by every measure that the system uses to evaluate its employees, exemplary. And I am telling you now that accuracy and diligence and exemplary performance are not enough if the system they serve is broken. If the system is sending souls to oblivion because of a clerical error — a routing glitch, a sixty-two-year skip, an anomaly that no one noticed because the records were designed not to record it — then the system requires not more efficiency but more mercy. And mercy, Mr. Cribb, is not efficient. Mercy is the decision to do the right thing even when the right thing takes longer and costs more and produces paperwork that the filing systems were not designed to accommodate."

Arthur Cribb, who had spent thirty-one years in the service of accuracy, who had never submitted an inaccurate ledger, who had built his professional identity on the principle that the numbers must always be correct and the records must always be complete, looked at Ms. Persimmon and understood — with the clarity of a man who had been dead long enough to achieve a perspective that life had not afforded him — that accuracy was not the highest virtue. That accuracy in the service of a broken system was a form of complicity. And that the choice before him was not between accuracy and mercy but between a small accuracy — the accuracy of numbers — and a large accuracy — the accuracy of justice.

"Where do we start?" he said.

Ms. Persimmon smiled. It was the first smile he had seen in the afterlife, and it was, he thought, worth dying for.

"We start," she said, "with the oldest records. We go to the basement. We open the files that no one has opened in eight hundred years. And we read them. One by one. Every soul that was lost, we find. Every evaluation that was skipped, we perform. Every assignment that was made by a glitch, we review."

"That will take forever."

Ms. Persimmon put on her glasses. "Mr. Cribb," she said, "we are in the afterlife. Forever is exactly what we have."

                            [THE END]

The discrepancy appeared in the seventh decimal place.

Dr. Elena Marchetti noticed it at 3:47 AM on a Wednesday in February, sitting alone in the computation room of the National Bureau of Standards in Gaithersburg, Maryland, where she had been recalculating the fine-structure constant from the latest high-precision measurements of the electron magnetic moment anomaly. The calculation was routine — or rather, it was the kind of calculation that particle physicists called routine, meaning that it required four hundred hours of supercomputer time, six months of data analysis, and a working familiarity with quantum electrodynamics at the fifth-order perturbative expansion, but that it had been performed so many times by so many researchers at so many institutions that the expected result was known to ten decimal places and any competent physicist could predict it before running the numbers.

The fine-structure constant, designated alpha, was one of the fundamental parameters of the universe. It governed the strength of the electromagnetic interaction — the force that held electrons in their orbits, atoms in their molecules, molecules in their materials, materials in their structures. It determined the speed of light relative to the speed of an electron in the ground state of hydrogen. It set the scale of the fine structure of atomic spectra, from which it derived its name. It was, in the language of physics, dimensionless — a pure number, without units, derived from three other fundamental constants (the elementary charge, Planck's constant, and the speed of light) in a ratio that was supposed to be fixed. Invariant. The same everywhere, at every time, under every condition.

Alpha was supposed to equal 0.0072973525693.

Marchetti's calculation yielded 0.0072973525712.

The discrepancy was in the tenth decimal place. Nineteen parts in ten trillion. A difference so small that most measurement systems could not detect it. A difference that any reasonable physicist would attribute to experimental error, computational artifact, or the accumulated rounding noise of a fifth-order perturbative calculation running on hardware that, however powerful, was not infinite in its precision.

Marchetti was a reasonable physicist. She checked the calculation. She checked the input data. She checked the computational parameters, the convergence criteria, the error-propagation estimates. She found nothing wrong. She ran the calculation again, from scratch, using a different computational method — a lattice QCD approach rather than the perturbative expansion — and obtained the same result.

0.0072973525712.

She set down her pencil — she still used pencils, a habit she had acquired from her doctoral advisor at Caltech, who had argued that pencils enforced a useful discipline of thought because they required the hand to move at the speed of understanding rather than the speed of typing — and looked at the number on her notepad.

Nineteen parts in ten trillion.

The most recent published value of the fine-structure constant, determined by a team at Harvard using a completely independent measurement technique, had been reported eight months ago. It had agreed with the previous value to twelve decimal places. Eight months was not a long time in the history of the universe. It was not a long time in the history of physics. It was not a long time by any standard except the standard that Marchetti's calculation was now, insistently and against every expectation, suggesting: the standard of a fundamental constant that was changing.

She did not sleep. She worked through the night and into the morning, running variations of the calculation with different starting parameters, different computational architectures, different error-handling protocols. The result did not change. At 9:15 AM, when her colleague Dr. James Harker arrived at the computation room carrying two cups of coffee and the casual cheerfulness of a man who had slept a normal number of hours, Marchetti showed him the number.

Harker looked at it. He set down the coffee. He sat down. He performed, mentally, the calculation that any trained physicist would perform when confronted with a measured value that disagreed with theory: he estimated the probability that the discrepancy was due to chance. The answer was very small. Small enough that Harker, who was not given to dramatic pronouncements, said:

"That can't be right."

"I've checked it seventeen times."

"Run it again."

"I've run it again. Six times. Two different methods."

Harker picked up his coffee, drank it, and set it down again. The gesture was mechanical. His eyes did not leave the number on Marchetti's notepad.

"If that number is correct," he said, "then alpha is changing."

"Yes."

"Alpha doesn't change."

"No."

"Alpha is a fundamental constant. It is built into the structure of the electromagnetic interaction. If it changes, the electromagnetic interaction changes. If the electromagnetic interaction changes, chemistry changes. If chemistry changes —"

"Everything changes."

They sat in the computation room. The fluorescent lights hummed. The supercomputer's cooling fans produced a continuous, low-frequency drone that Marchetti had long since stopped hearing but that was, she now reflected, powered by electromagnetic processes that depended on the fine-structure constant being exactly the number it had always been, and that would, if the constant continued to change, eventually cease to function.

"We need to measure it independently," Harker said. "Not calculate. Measure. High-precision spectroscopy. Penning trap. Something that gives us alpha directly, without relying on QED perturbation theory."

"Agreed."

"And we need to check the other constants."

Marchetti nodded. This was the thought she had been avoiding. Because if the fine-structure constant was changing, the question was not merely whether alpha was drifting but whether the drift was confined to alpha or whether it extended to the other fundamental constants — the gravitational constant, the strong coupling constant, the Higgs vacuum expectation value, the cosmological constant. If alpha was changing alone, the situation was extraordinary. If the other constants were changing too, the situation was something for which physics did not have a word, because physics had been constructed on the assumption that the constants were constant, and a world in which they were not was a world in which physics, as a descriptive framework, was becoming progressively less accurate.

A world in which the rules were changing.

                              II.

The independent measurement confirmed the drift.

It took three months — three months of high-precision spectroscopy performed in a magnetically shielded laboratory in the basement of the Bureau of Standards, using a single electron confined in a Penning trap and interrogated with microwave radiation at frequencies that the team controlled to fourteen significant figures. The measurement was, by any standard, among the most precise ever performed by human beings — a determination of a physical quantity to an accuracy that exceeded the accuracy of the most precise clocks, the most stable lasers, the most carefully controlled experimental environments on Earth.

The result was 0.0072973525731.

Alpha had changed again. In three months. The drift was accelerating.

Marchetti plotted the data points: the published value from eight months ago, her initial calculation from February, and the new measurement from May. Three points. They did not lie on a straight line. They lay on a curve — an upward curve, the increment between successive values increasing with each measurement, the rate of change itself changing, the drift accelerating in a manner that was consistent with an exponential function.

She showed the plot to Harker. He looked at it for a long time.

"If this rate continues," he said, "alpha will have shifted by one part per billion within five years."

"That's in the range where chemical bond energies start to be affected."

"I know."

"Molecular spectroscopy would be measurably different. Crystal structures would be measurably different. The emission spectra of every element in the periodic table would be measurably different."

"I know."

"Within twenty years, at this rate, the shift would be large enough to affect semiconductor physics. Transistor behavior would change. The entire electronics infrastructure would become unreliable."

"I know."

"Within a century —"

"Within a century, physics stops working." Harker's voice was flat. Not emotional — Harker was not an emotional man — but flat in the specific way of a voice that has encountered a fact so large that the vocal apparatus has temporarily lost the capacity to modulate. "If alpha is changing exponentially, then within a century the electromagnetic interaction will have shifted far enough from its current value that the equations we use to describe it will no longer be accurate. Chemistry will work differently. Materials will behave differently. Biological processes — enzymes, DNA replication, photosynthesis, nerve conduction — all of them depend on the electromagnetic interaction being exactly what it is. If alpha changes by more than a few parts per million, proteins will misfold. Enzymes will lose their catalytic function. DNA polymerase will make errors at rates that exceed the repair mechanisms. Biology will stop working."

"Not stop," Marchetti said. "Change. Biology will work differently. Proteins will fold differently. Enzymes will catalyze different reactions. DNA will encode different instructions — or the same instructions will produce different proteins, because the codon-to-amino-acid translation depends on molecular geometries that depend on bond angles that depend on the electromagnetic interaction that depends on alpha."

"That's not biology changing. That's biology breaking."

"It's biology becoming something else."

Harker looked at her. "Is there a difference?"

Marchetti did not answer immediately. She was thinking about something that the data implied but did not state — something that existed in the space between the measured values, in the shape of the exponential curve, in the accelerating rate of change that her three data points described.

"James," she said. "The drift is exponential."

"Yes."

"An exponential function has no natural stopping point. It accelerates forever. If alpha is changing exponentially, it will continue to change, faster and faster, until —"

"Until what?"

"That's the question. An exponential process either continues until it exhausts the conditions that sustain it, or until it's interrupted by a countervailing force. What conditions sustain the drift of a fundamental constant? What force could counteract it?"

"I don't know. Nobody knows. The question has never arisen because the constants have never changed."

"As far as we know."

Harker paused. "What do you mean?"

"I mean that we have been measuring fundamental constants for approximately a century. Physics has existed, as a quantitative science, for approximately four centuries. The universe has existed for approximately fourteen billion years. Our window of observation covers an unimaginably small fraction of the universe's history. We have been assuming that the constants are constant because they have appeared constant during the infinitesimal interval in which we have been capable of measuring them. But an exponential process that began slowly — that began with changes so small that they fell below our detection threshold for millions or billions of years — would look constant to any observer who sampled it during its early, nearly-flat phase. It would only become detectable when the acceleration pushed the rate of change above the measurement noise. Which is what appears to be happening now."

Harker was very still. The cooling fans droned. The fluorescent lights hummed. The Penning trap, in its magnetically shielded enclosure, held its single electron in a quantum state that depended, for its stability, on the fine-structure constant being the number it had always been, and that was now, according to the data, the number it was ceasing to be.

"You're suggesting that the constants have always been changing," he said. "That the universe has never been static. That the rules have been evolving — slowly, imperceptibly, over billions of years — and that we are simply the first observers unlucky enough to be alive at the moment when the rate of change crosses the threshold of detectability."

"I'm suggesting it's possible. I'm suggesting that the data is consistent with that interpretation."

"And the implication is that the universe — the physical universe, with its specific laws and specific constants and specific rules of operation — is not a permanent structure. It's a phase. A transient configuration. Like a weather system, or a geological era, or a biological epoch. It has a beginning and a duration and an end, and we happen to be living near the end."

"Not the end," Marchetti said. "The transition. The universe isn't ending. The rules are changing. What comes after the transition will still be a universe — will still have physics, will still have constants, will still have structure and regularity and laws. But they won't be our physics. They won't be our constants. They won't be our laws."

"Then what will they be?"

Marchetti looked at the plot — three data points on a curve that rose toward a future she could not calculate, because the equations she would need to calculate it were derived from the very constants that were changing, making the equations themselves progressively less reliable, a snake eating its own tail, a map dissolving as you tried to read it.

"I don't know," she said. "And that — the not knowing — is perhaps the most accurate thing I can say."

                              III.

They published the results.

The paper appeared in Physical Review Letters under the deliberately understated title "Observational Evidence for Temporal Variation in the Fine-Structure Constant." It was six pages long, densely mathematical, scrupulously qualified, and entirely terrifying.

The response from the physics community was immediate and, for the first two weeks, almost entirely hostile. The fine-structure constant did not change. It was a fundamental parameter of the universe, built into the fabric of reality at the level of quantum field theory. To claim that it was drifting was to claim that quantum electrodynamics — the most precisely tested theory in the history of science, accurate to twelve decimal places, confirmed by experiments spanning six decades — was wrong. Or, worse, was becoming wrong. Was losing its accuracy in real time, its predictions diverging from measurement as the constant on which it depended slid away from its historical value.

The criticism was professional, rigorous, and, in some cases, personal. A senior theorist at Princeton published a response arguing that Marchetti's data was contaminated by systematic errors in the Penning trap measurement. A team at CERN pointed out that the lattice QCD calculation relied on approximations whose error bounds, at the precision Marchetti was claiming, could not be fully controlled. An experimentalist at NIST — Marchetti's own institution — sent a private email suggesting, with the icy courtesy of a colleague who believed he was witnessing a career-ending mistake, that she reconsider publication.

Marchetti did not reconsider. She responded to each criticism with data. She invited the Princeton theorist to visit the laboratory and examine the Penning trap apparatus. She provided the CERN team with her complete computational logs. She answered the NIST colleague's email with a single sentence: "Come to the lab and measure it yourself."

They came. They measured. The data held.

Within six months, three independent groups — at CERN, at RIKEN in Japan, and at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna — had confirmed the drift. Alpha was changing. The rate was exponential. The acceleration was measurable.

The world did not end. The world did not, in any immediate sense, change. The fine-structure constant had shifted by less than thirty parts per trillion from its historical value, a quantity so small that no technology, no biological process, no chemical reaction, no material property was measurably affected. The lights still worked. The computers still functioned. The electrons still orbited the nuclei of atoms in configurations that were, for all practical purposes, identical to the configurations they had occupied since the formation of the solar system.

But the knowledge changed things. Not the physical world — not yet — but the mental world, the conceptual world, the world of assumptions and expectations and unconscious certainties that human beings carried with them the way they carried their skeletal structure, unnoticed and load-bearing.

The constants were not constant.

The universe was not permanent.

The rules were changing.

Marchetti gave a lecture at Caltech — her alma mater — in the fall. The auditorium was full. She stood at the blackboard, her pencil in her hand, and she drew the curve. Three data points. An exponential. A future that rose off the top of the graph into a region where the equations that described the present ceased to function.

"This curve," she said, "describes the end of the universe as we know it. Not the end of the universe — there is no reason to believe that spacetime itself will cease to exist. But the end of the specific configuration of physical law that permits the existence of atoms, molecules, chemistry, biology, and consciousness as we understand them. Within a century, the fine-structure constant will have shifted far enough to disrupt chemical bonding at the molecular level. Within two centuries, nuclear physics will be affected. Within five centuries, the gravitational constant — which preliminary data suggests is also drifting, though we have not yet achieved the measurement precision to confirm this — may have shifted far enough to alter the dynamics of planetary orbits."

She paused. The auditorium was silent. Not the silence of boredom or incomprehension but the silence of people who were listening with the full weight of their attention, the way people listen when they are being told something that matters.

"I want to be clear about what this does and does not mean. It does not mean that the universe is dying. An exponential change in fundamental constants is not an approach to zero — it is an approach to different values. The universe after the transition will have physics. It will have structure. It will have regularity and law. It will be, in every meaningful sense, a universe. But it will not be our universe. It will operate according to rules that we cannot predict, because our predictions are derived from the current values of the constants, and those values are the very things that are changing."

She set down her pencil.

"We are accustomed to thinking of the physical universe as a stage — a fixed, permanent, unchanging backdrop against which the drama of cosmic and biological evolution plays out. The stage has always been there. The stage will always be there. The actors change; the stage endures. This understanding is wrong. The stage is also changing. The stage has always been changing, so slowly that we could not detect it, so gradually that it appeared fixed. But it is changing, and the rate of change is accelerating, and within a timescale that is very short by cosmic standards — a few centuries, a few millennia — the stage will have transformed into something unrecognizable."

A hand rose in the audience. A graduate student, young, serious, clearly frightened. "What should we do?"

Marchetti looked at her. The question was not a physics question. It was a human question. It was the question that every person asks when they learn that the ground beneath their feet is not solid but shifting, not permanent but provisional, not the foundation they assumed but one phase of an ongoing process that neither asks their permission nor accommodates their preferences.

"I don't know," Marchetti said. "I know what the data shows. I know the rate of change. I know the likely timescale. I know that within a few generations, the physical conditions that permit human biology will no longer obtain, and that the transition will not be abrupt but gradual — a slow, accelerating dissolution of the familiar into the unprecedented. I know these things because I am a physicist and the data is clear."

She paused.

"But I also know that the data describes a universe that is not ending but becoming. The constants are not collapsing to zero. They are moving to new values. The universe on the other side of the transition will have its own physics, its own chemistry, its own possibilities. We cannot know what those possibilities will be, because our imaginations are constrained by the physics we inhabit. But the universe is not constrained by our imaginations. It never has been."

She picked up her pencil. She looked at the curve on the blackboard — the three data points, the exponential rise, the future that climbed toward a region where her equations ceased to function and her predictions ceased to be possible.

"What should we do?" she repeated. "We should do what we have always done. We should measure. We should observe. We should describe what we see with the greatest precision available to us, knowing that our instruments are calibrated to a reality that is in the process of changing, and that our descriptions will therefore become progressively less accurate, and that the accumulation of inaccuracy is not a failure of our science but a feature of our universe, which is, it turns out, larger and stranger and more provisional than we supposed."

She set down the pencil for the last time.

"The constants are changing. The rules are being rewritten. The universe is becoming something new. And we — we small, temporary, carbon-based observers, evolved under a specific set of physical conditions that will not endure — we are the ones who noticed. We are the ones who measured the change. We are the ones who wrote it down. Whatever comes after us, whatever new physics the universe invents, whatever new forms of complexity the new constants permit — we will have been the ones who stood at the boundary and said: here. This is where the old world ends and the new one begins. We saw it. We measured it. We described it as precisely as we could."

"That is enough. That has always been enough."

The auditorium was silent for a long time.

Then someone applauded. Then everyone did.

The woman from the future arrived in Washington, D.C. on the morning of August 19th, 1967, wearing a cotton dress that was slightly wrong — the fabric too uniform, the stitching too even, the color a shade of blue that did not quite match any dye available in any factory currently operating in the United States — and carrying a suitcase that contained, among other items, a guidebook.

The guidebook was the problem. Not because it was anachronistic — she had taken great care to ensure that its physical form was indistinguishable from a standard 1967 trade paperback — but because of what it contained. It was titled A Visitor's Guide to the American Century: 1945-1975, and it had been written by the Department of Historical Experience at the University of New Geneva, and it described the period in which she now stood with the cheerful, authoritative, slightly condescending tone of a travel guide explaining a foreign country to tourists who were expected to find the customs quaint.

Her name was Lila Osei. She was thirty-four years old. She was a historian specializing in what her civilization called the Late Combustion Period — the era, roughly 1850 to 2020, during which human societies organized themselves around the extraction and burning of fossil carbon — and she had been granted permission to conduct field research in the primary temporal zone, which was the polite euphemism her university used for the past.

She had requested 1967 specifically. The guidebook described it as "a year of exceptional density — a convergence of social, political, cultural, and psychological forces that crystallized many of the Late Combustion Period's defining tensions into forms that subsequent historians would recognize as pivotal." She had chosen Washington because it was the capital of the most powerful nation in the period's most consequential geopolitical arrangement, and because the guidebook promised that a visitor who spent a week in Washington in August of 1967 would encounter, within a manageable geographic radius, a representative cross-section of the era's characteristic pathologies.

Pathologies. That was the guidebook's word. Lila had objected to it in her pre-departure seminar, arguing that it was reductive to describe an entire civilization's suffering as pathological — that the people of the Late Combustion Period were not sick but constrained, not dysfunctional but operating within systems that limited their options in ways that made certain outcomes inevitable. Her seminar advisor, a gentle, white-haired man named Professor Tan who had himself conducted field research in the 1940s, had smiled and said: "You're right, of course. But you haven't been there yet. Go. See. Then tell me whether 'pathology' is the wrong word."

She stepped out of the alley where the displacement had deposited her — the technology was precise about temporal coordinates but approximate about spatial ones, which the engineers attributed to the difficulty of calculating the Earth's position relative to the galactic center across temporal intervals, and which Lila attributed to the engineers' unwillingness to admit that their machine didn't work as well as they claimed — and walked onto the sidewalk.

The heat struck her first. August in Washington: she had read about it, studied the climatological data, reviewed the historical accounts of visiting diplomats who had classified the city as a hardship posting on the basis of its summers alone. But the data had not prepared her for the physical reality of ninety-three degrees Fahrenheit at nine in the morning, the air thick with humidity and the exhaust of internal combustion engines that lined every street in quantities that, to Lila's eyes, constituted a kind of visual hallucination — so many vehicles, so close together, each one burning refined petroleum and releasing the combustion products directly into the atmosphere that the people on the sidewalk were breathing.

They were breathing it. Without masks. Without filters. Without any visible indication that they considered the air unusual or dangerous. This was the atmosphere they lived in. This was normal.

Lila stood on the sidewalk and breathed. The air tasted of gasoline and hot asphalt and something vegetal — the trees, she realized, the trees that lined the street, broad-leaved deciduous trees whose canopy provided intermittent shade, their leaves manufacturing oxygen at a rate that was, she calculated automatically, insufficient to offset the carbon dioxide output of the vehicles passing beneath them but that contributed, nevertheless, to the breathability of an atmosphere that would have triggered an environmental emergency alarm in any inhabited space in her own time.

The guidebook had a section on air quality. It noted, with the breezy assurance of an author who knew how the story ended, that the atmospheric CO2 concentration in 1967 was approximately 322 parts per million — a number that Lila's civilization regarded the way a doctor regards a patient's blood pressure at the moment before the stroke. Three twenty-two. The number at which everything was still, technically, within normal parameters, and at which the trajectory toward catastrophe was already locked in, already irreversible by any measure that did not include the immediate cessation of fossil carbon combustion on a global scale, which was — as every child in Lila's civilization learned before the age of ten — a thing that did not happen, that was not even seriously discussed, that was as foreign to the political vocabulary of 1967 as quantum computing or genetic engineering.

She walked. The guidebook recommended a specific itinerary for a first-day visitor: the National Mall, where the major monuments and institutions were concentrated, and which provided, according to the guide, "a compact symbolic landscape of the American Late Combustion experience."

She walked to the Mall. She stood before the Lincoln Memorial and read the Gettysburg Address inscribed on its walls and thought about the fact that a century after the war that ended legal slavery in this country, the descendants of enslaved people were still, in 1967, fighting for the rights that the war had ostensibly secured. She had studied this. She had read the primary sources. She had watched the archival footage. But standing here, in the heat, in the exhaust-flavored air, looking at the faces of the people on the Mall — some of them white, some of them Black, all of them navigating a social landscape in which the color of their skin determined, with a precision that would have been called algorithmic if anyone in 1967 had used that word casually, the opportunities available to them, the spaces open to them, the degree of violence to which they were subject — standing here, she understood something that the archives had not conveyed.

It was not over.

In her time, it was over. In her time, the racial hierarchies of the Late Combustion Period were studied the way her medical colleagues studied historical diseases — with clinical interest, with compassion for the sufferers, with a certain intellectual difficulty in understanding how a civilization could have tolerated a pathology so obviously destructive. But here, in 1967, it was not over. It was happening. The suffering was present tense. The people on the Mall were not historical figures in an archive. They were alive, and their lives were shaped by systems of oppression that Lila's civilization had dismantled so thoroughly that they were difficult to even conceptualize, the way it is difficult to conceptualize a world without antibiotics if you have never known infection.

She sat on the steps of the Memorial and opened the guidebook. The section on race relations in 1967 occupied forty pages and was illustrated with photographs that she recognized from her university's archive. She turned to a page at random:

"The visitor should be aware that racial segregation, while legally prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, remains operative in practice across much of the country. Housing, education, employment, and social services are distributed along racial lines with a consistency that the legislation has not significantly disrupted. The visitor is advised to observe these patterns without intervention, as the temporal protocols strictly prohibit..."

Lila closed the guidebook.

                              II.

She spent three days following the guidebook's itinerary. She visited the institutions and the monuments and the neighborhoods and the markets and the bus stations and the hospitals and the schools. She observed, as the guidebook instructed, the patterns of a civilization organized around principles that her own civilization had abandoned — the concentrations of wealth, the distributions of suffering, the architectural and spatial encoding of hierarchy, the thousand visible and invisible mechanisms by which a society communicated to its members which of them mattered and which of them did not.

She visited a neighborhood in Southeast Washington where the houses were small and the streets were cracked and the children played in water from an opened fire hydrant because there was no public pool, the public pool having been closed — she learned this from a woman sitting on a porch, who told her without rancor and without surprise, in the tone of someone describing weather — because the city had preferred to close it rather than integrate it.

She visited a hospital where a Black woman waited seven hours in an emergency room with a broken wrist while white patients with less severe conditions were seen first, the triage system operating according to criteria that were not written in any protocol but that were understood by everyone in the room, a set of unspoken rules as effective and as invisible as the laws of physics.

She visited a recruitment office where young men — disproportionately young men of color, disproportionately young men from neighborhoods where the houses were small and the streets were cracked — were being processed for service in a war that Lila's guidebook described, in its breezy, retrospective way, as "the Late Combustion Period's most destructive exercise in imperial overreach," and that the young men in the recruitment office described, when she spoke to them, in terms that were more immediate and less analytical: they described it as the thing they had to do because there were no jobs and no college deferments and no other way out of the neighborhoods where the public pools had been closed rather than integrated.

She visited a church where a congregation sang hymns that Lila recognized from her university's archive of Late Combustion Period sacred music, the harmonies rising and falling in patterns that were, she realized as she listened, identical in their emotional architecture to the patterns of the secular music of her own time — the same surges and resolutions, the same tensions and releases, the same fundamental assertion that the experience of being alive was simultaneously unbearable and worth bearing. She sat in the back pew and listened and wept, not because the music was sad — though some of it was — but because it was beautiful, and the beauty existed in the same space as the suffering, and the coexistence of beauty and suffering was, she understood now, the defining characteristic of the era she had come to study, the thing that the guidebook's breezy analysis could never capture, the thing that you had to be here, in the heat, in the exhaust, in the broken streets and the closed pools and the seven-hour emergency room waits, to understand.

On the fourth day, she closed the guidebook and did not open it again.

                              * * *

On the fifth day, she met a woman named Clara Johnson.

Clara was sixty-one years old. She lived in the Southeast neighborhood where the children played in hydrant water. She had raised five children, four of whom were living, the fifth having died of pneumonia at age three because the nearest hospital with a pediatric ward that would admit Black children was twenty-two miles away and Clara's husband had not owned a car and the ambulance service did not operate in their neighborhood after dark.

Clara told Lila this story without self-pity and without anger, in the patient, factual voice of a person who has told the same story many times and who has learned that the story's power lies not in the emotion with which it is told but in the facts themselves, which are sufficient, which need no embellishment, which simply are.

Lila listened. She sat in Clara's kitchen, in a wooden chair, at a table covered with a cloth that was clean and pressed and patterned with small yellow flowers, and she listened, and she did not take notes, and she did not consult the guidebook, and she did not think about the temporal protocols or the research methodology or the Department of Historical Experience's guidelines for field researchers conducting primary-source interviews in the Late Combustion Period.

She listened to a woman who had lost a child because the ambulance didn't come.

"Why are you here?" Clara asked, when the story was finished. Not suspiciously — curiously. The curiosity of a person who has lived long enough to know that people do not appear in her kitchen without reasons, and who prefers to know the reasons.

Lila considered lying. The temporal protocols required lying. The cover story she had been assigned — visiting scholar from a small liberal arts college in Vermont — was plausible and rehearsed. But she looked at Clara's face, at the kitchen with its clean cloth and its yellow flowers and its window that looked out on a street where children were playing in hydrant water because the city had closed the pool, and she could not bring herself to add a lie to the inventory of indignities that this woman's life had contained.

"I'm from the future," she said.

Clara looked at her for a long time. Then she said: "How far?"

"Far enough that things are different."

"Different how?"

"The pool is open. The ambulance comes. The hospital doesn't make you wait."

Clara was quiet. She looked at the cloth on the table, at the yellow flowers, at her own hands resting on the cloth. Hands that had washed laundry and cooked meals and held a dying child and pressed a clean cloth smooth on a kitchen table every morning for forty years.

"That's good," she said. "That's good to know."

"It took a long time."

"I expect it did."

"I came here to study," Lila said. "To observe. To understand what it was like. I was supposed to look and take notes and go home and write about it."

"And?"

"And I can't."

"Can't what?"

"Can't go home. Can't go back to where the pool is open and the ambulance comes and pretend that I understand what it was like, because I didn't understand it from the archives and I don't understand it now that I'm here. Understanding isn't the right word. You can't understand suffering from the outside. You can only witness it. And witnessing it — being here, seeing it, sitting in your kitchen and hearing about your child — changes you in a way that makes going home feel like running away."

Clara looked at her. The look was not sympathetic, exactly — sympathy was a luxury that Clara's life had not encouraged her to dispense casually — but it was knowing. The look of a woman who understood, from sixty-one years of experience, what it meant to be changed by what you had seen.

"Everybody wants to run away," Clara said. "That's not a sin. The sin is running away and then forgetting what you ran from."

                              III.

On the sixth day, Lila was supposed to return. The displacement window was scheduled for 11:47 PM. She was supposed to go to the alley, stand in the designated coordinates, and wait for the temporal field to activate and carry her back to a world where the air was clean and the pools were open and no child died because the ambulance didn't come.

She did not go to the alley.

She sat in her hotel room — a modest room in a modest hotel, the kind of room the guidebook recommended for "authentic period immersion" — and she thought about what she had seen. The heat and the exhaust. The closed pools and the seven-hour waits. The young men at the recruitment office. The music in the church. Clara's kitchen with its yellow flowers and its story of a child who died twenty-two miles from help that would not come.

She thought about her own civilization, which had solved these problems. Solved them completely. Solved them so thoroughly that the suffering she had witnessed this week was, in her world, as alien as the suffering of the Middle Ages — studied in universities, commemorated in museums, impossible to truly comprehend because the conditions that produced it had been eliminated so completely that they were difficult to even imagine.

And she thought about what that elimination had cost. Not in resources — resources had been abundant in the post-scarcity economy her civilization had built. Not in effort — the effort had been immense but had been freely given. The cost had been something subtler and more difficult to name. The cost was the loss of the capacity to feel what she was feeling now — the rawness, the immediacy, the unbearable proximity to suffering that her civilization's comfort had made impossible. In her world, suffering was historical. In this world, suffering was present. And the presence of suffering produced, in those who witnessed it, a quality of attention — of urgency, of moral seriousness, of agonized engagement with the question of how to live — that her civilization, for all its achievements, had lost.

Not lost. Traded. Her civilization had traded suffering for comfort and had received, in the exchange, everything that comfort could provide: health, safety, longevity, material abundance, freedom from fear. It was an excellent trade. It was the right trade. She would not reverse it. She would not wish Clara's suffering back into existence for the sake of the moral clarity it produced.

But she could not pretend that the trade had been costless. And she could not pretend that the cost was unimportant. And she could not — sitting in this hotel room, in this city, in this year, with Clara's story in her ears and the taste of exhaust in her mouth and the knowledge that the ambulance was not coming and would not come for years, for decades, for the better part of a century — she could not pretend that going home was an adequate response to what she had seen.

The guidebook, which she had closed and not opened, sat on the bedside table. Its breezy authority, its retrospective confidence, its certainty that the story ended well — all of it was, she understood now, a form of anesthesia. The guidebook converted living suffering into historical narrative. It turned present tense into past tense. It transformed the unbearable into the academic. And she had come here — had traveled across centuries — to experience the thing that the guidebook neutralized, and having experienced it, she could not un-experience it, could not return to the breezy retrospection of a civilization that knew how the story ended and therefore believed the ending justified the means.

Clara had said: The sin is running away and then forgetting what you ran from.

Lila did not intend to forget.

She picked up the hotel telephone. She called the operator. She asked to be connected to the offices of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.

"I'd like to volunteer," she said.

The woman on the other end of the line paused. "Ma'am, are you aware of what we do?"

"Yes."

"And you understand the risks?"

Lila thought about her clean, comfortable, suffering-free world, where the air was pure and the pools were open and the ambulances came for everyone regardless of the color of their skin, and where no one felt the way she felt right now — this raw, aching, furious, clarifying pain of witnessing injustice in its living, breathing, present-tense reality.

"I understand the risks," she said. "I'm not going home."

The temporal protocols were violated. The displacement window at 11:47 PM opened in the alley and found nothing, its field activating and deactivating in the empty space where Lila Osei was supposed to be standing, the technology performing flawlessly, the designated coordinates perfectly calculated, the only variable unaccounted for being the one variable that no technology, in any era, has ever been able to predict: what a person will do when they see suffering that they have the power to address and the choice to ignore.

She did not return to the future. The Department of Historical Experience recorded her as a temporal loss — the clinical term for a field researcher who fails to return, which happened, the department's records noted, more often than the public was told, and always for the same reason, which was that the past, when experienced rather than studied, had a tendency to become the present, and the present had a tendency to demand participation rather than observation.

Lila participated. She spent the rest of her life in the twentieth century, working, organizing, teaching, and bearing witness to a civilization in the process of becoming something better, slowly, painfully, against enormous resistance, with no guarantee of success, in a world where the air tasted of exhaust and the constants of human cruelty appeared, to those living within them, as fixed and immutable as the laws of physics.

She knew they were not. She had seen the future. She knew the story ended well — or ended better, which was not the same thing but was sufficient. And the knowledge that things would eventually improve did not diminish the urgency of the present. If anything, it increased it. Because if the future was possible — if the clean air and the open pools and the ambulances that came were not fantasies but realities, calculated and confirmed, waiting in the probability space of an unborn tomorrow — then every day that the future was delayed was a day of unnecessary suffering, and every person who could shorten the delay and did not was complicit in the suffering that the delay contained.

Clara had said: The sin is running away and then forgetting what you ran from.

Lila Osei did not run. She did not forget. She stayed in the burning heart of the present tense and did what she could, which was not enough — it was never enough — but which was what she had, and what she had was what she gave, and the giving was the thing that mattered, the only thing that had ever mattered, the only thing that would matter when the future finally arrived and someone, perhaps, opened a guidebook and read about a woman from another time who had come to 1967 and stayed because she could not bear to leave the suffering behind.

The guidebook would not mention her. Guidebooks never mention the people who stay.

But the work would. The slow, patient, unglamorous work of building a future that was worth traveling to — that work would remember her, the way soil remembers rain, the way a river remembers its source, the way the future, when it finally arrives, remembers every hand that helped to build it, even the hands that no one wrote about, even the hands that history forgot.

Especially those.

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

JULIAN ST. CROIX is a British writer whose first novel, "The Hourglass
Garden" (Faber & Faber, 1961), was a finalist for the Somerset Maugham
Award. "The Atlas of Unborn Futures" is the sequel to "The Cartographer
of Lost Tomorrows," which appeared in Issue #56 and which remains one
of the most discussed stories in this magazine's history. It is also,
by a considerable margin, the longest single piece of fiction we have
ever published, and we suspect it will hold that record for some time.
St. Croix reports that the story required fourteen months of composition,
three nervous breakdowns, and an amount of champagne that he declines
to quantify. He lives in Bloomsbury, London, and is at work on a
second novel that he describes as "a love story set in every possible
universe simultaneously."

MARGARET THORNTON holds a master's degree in marine biology from the
University of Washington and has conducted fieldwork in environments
ranging from the tide pools of the San Juan Islands to the volcanic
soils of Iceland. "The Seed Vault" is her most personal story — she
has described it as "a letter to the future from someone who doesn't
expect to receive a reply" — and it reflects both her scientific
training and her growing engagement with the environmental movement.
She lives on Orcas Island in the San Juan archipelago, where she
tends a garden with the same meticulous attention she gives to her
prose, and where she is, she tells us, conducting an experiment in
whether a single human being can, through careful cultivation, maintain
a viable population of every native wildflower species in the San Juan
Islands. Current results: promising but incomplete.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, and "Accountant of Souls" is evidence that forty-seven
stories have not exhausted his capacity to surprise us. We did not
expect Cain to write a Kafkaesque satire of the afterlife. We did not
expect it to be funny. We especially did not expect it to make us cry.
The character of Ms. Persimmon — her glasses, her conviction, her
magnificent final line — is among the finest things Cain has created
in fourteen years of writing for these pages. He lives in Dearborn,
Michigan, and works by day as a technical writer for General Motors,
a position that, he assures us, provides daily experience with the
kind of institutional bureaucracy that the afterlife in his story so
faithfully reproduces.

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a professor of astrophysics at Caltech and one
of the most respected voices in hard science fiction. "Null Set" is
a departure for Koslov — not a story of space or stars but of the
fundamental constants that make space and stars possible, and of what
happens when those constants begin to change. It is, in our estimation,
the most frightening story he has written, and the most hopeful,
which is a contradiction that Koslov resolves with the clarity and
the grace that have characterized his work since "Perihelion" appeared
in our third issue fourteen years ago. He lives in Pasadena with his
wife Anne, a sculptor, and reports that the story was inspired by a
conversation with a colleague who asked, over lunch, "What if alpha
isn't constant?" — a question that ruined Koslov's appetite and
produced, six months later, this extraordinary story.

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW is the finest time travel writer of her generation,
and "Comfort of Strangers" extends her range in a direction we did not
anticipate. Where her previous stories have explored the paradoxes of
temporal mechanics, this one explores the paradox of temporal
perspective — the way that knowing how the story ends changes the moral
weight of the present. It is, she tells us, the most difficult story
she has written, not because of its structural complexity (which is,
by Crenshaw's standards, restrained) but because of its emotional
demands. "I had to sit in 1967," she says, "and look at my own country
through the eyes of someone who knows what we could become, and then
ask whether knowledge of the future is a comfort or an accusation."
She lives in Philadelphia with her husband David and is, she reports,
considering a sequel — though she warns us that Lila Osei is not an
easy character to write, because "she keeps wanting to do things that
I'm not brave enough to do myself."

                         SIGNALS RECEIVED
                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Editors,

I have now read "The Cartographer of Lost Tomorrows" (Issue #56)
four times, and with each reading I find new layers of meaning in
St. Croix's extraordinary prose. The question of whether the future
is being manufactured rather than predicted haunts me. I work as a
city planner in Sacramento and I find myself, with increasing
frequency, asking of every proposal that crosses my desk: whose
future does this serve? I cannot thank you enough for publishing a
story that has made me better at my job.

                              — Richard Yamada
                                 Sacramento, California

Dear Mr. Sterling and Ms. Foxworth,

Thornton's "Succession" (Issue #66) should be required reading in
every biology department in the country. I say this as someone who
teaches evolutionary biology at a major university and who encounters,
with depressing regularity, students who have been taught to think of
ecology as a branch of resource management rather than as a moral
discipline. Thornton understands something that most science fiction
writers do not: that the relationship between human beings and the
natural world is not a problem to be solved but a covenant to be
honored. More Thornton, please. As much as you can print.

                              — Dr. Patricia Hayward
                                 Department of Biology
                                 University of Michigan

Dear Editors,

I must respectfully disagree with the letter in your May issue that
described Koslov's "The Quiet After Cascade" as "cold" and
"emotionally detached." Dr. Koslov writes about physics the way a
priest writes about God — with precision born of reverence. That the
emotion in his prose is understated does not mean it is absent. It
means he trusts his readers to find it without being told where to
look. I have been reading Dr. Koslov since Issue #3 and I have never
once felt that his stories lacked feeling. They are full of feeling.
The feeling is simply expressed in the language of the cosmos rather
than the language of the confessional, and some of us prefer it
that way.

                              — Margaret Liu
                                 Pasadena, California

Dear Ms. Foxworth,

As a young writer of color attempting to break into science fiction,
I want to express my gratitude for the work Dolores Reyes is doing
in your pages. "Color of Her Sky" (Issue #56) was the first science
fiction story I ever read that made me feel seen — not as an exotic
element in someone else's narrative but as a whole person in a
narrative that belonged to me. This matters more than I can say.
Please keep publishing writers who understand that the future
belongs to everyone.

                              — Samuel Okonkwo

THE EINSTEIN INTERSECTION by Samuel R. Delany
(Ace Books, 1967)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Samuel Delany has written what may be the year's most original novel,
and one of the most frustrating, and the frustration is inseparable
from the originality, which is what makes it art. In a far-future
Earth where alien beings have inherited human civilization and are
attempting to understand the mythological patterns they've inherited,
Delany creates a narrative that is simultaneously a science fiction
adventure, a meditation on myth and meaning, and a jazz improvisation
on themes borrowed from Orpheus, Christ, and the American blues
tradition. The prose is gorgeous — Delany writes sentences that
sing — and the ideas are provocative, and the plot is, at times,
genuinely bewildering, which some readers will find infuriating and
which we consider a feature rather than a flaw. Delany is twenty-five
years old. He is already writing at a level that most writers never
achieve. Watch this man. He is going to reshape the field.

LORD OF LIGHT by Roger Zelazny
(Doubleday, 1967)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Zelazny's latest novel opens with one of the finest first lines in
recent science fiction — "His followers called him Mahasamatman and
said he was a god" — and sustains that level of invention across
three hundred pages of mythological science fiction that is unlike
anything else being written. On a colonized world where the original
crew have used technology to become the gods of the Hindu pantheon,
one man — Sam, the Buddha — leads a rebellion against divine tyranny.
The premise is audacious. The execution is magnificent. Zelazny
writes with a poet's ear and a fighter's instincts, and the result
is a novel that manages to be simultaneously a theological argument,
a political thriller, and a meditation on the nature of power and
liberation. This is Zelazny at his best, which is as good as anyone
writing science fiction today.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #72 — November 1967

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue, which will
be available in late October:

"THE CARTOGRAPHY OF SLEEP" by Julian St. Croix — After the epic
ambition of "The Atlas of Unborn Futures," St. Croix returns with a
shorter, more intimate work about a woman who discovers that her
dreams are maps of other people's memories. Lyrical, unsettling, and
unmistakably St. Croix.

"PHENOTYPE" by Margaret Thornton — A generation ship's botanist
discovers that the ship's stored genomes are being subtly altered by
an unknown process, producing organisms that have no terrestrial
analog. Thornton explores the boundary between preservation and
transformation.

"THE LONG COUNT" by Phyllis Crenshaw — A temporal paradox story set
in the Mayan classical period, in which a time traveler's attempt to
prevent the collapse of Mayan civilization creates the very conditions
that cause it. Crenshaw at her structurally inventive best.

"UNION DUES" by Theodore Cain — The robots of an automated mining
operation attempt to organize a labor union. Cain delivers a story
that is both funny and surprisingly moving, and that asks whether the
dignity of work requires the capacity to refuse it.

Plus: letters from our readers, book reviews, and more.
