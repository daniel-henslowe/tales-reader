TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

November has come, and with it that particular quality of light that
makes a man look backward even as he walks forward. The trees along
Lexington Avenue have gone to amber and rust, and the wind off the East
River carries the first honest chill of the approaching winter. It is a
season for reflection, and this issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond
reflects accordingly.

I have been editing this magazine for nearly two years now — twenty-three
issues, each one assembled in the controlled chaos of our offices on
East 32nd Street, each one sent into the world with the hope that it
will find its readers and give them something worth their thirty-five
cents and their evening hours. In that time I have published over one
hundred and thirty stories, and I have learned something about the
peculiar alchemy of assembling a magazine: it is not enough to collect
good stories. The stories must speak to each other. They must create,
in their arrangement, something larger than any one of them alone.

This month, that larger something is the passage of time itself.

Gunnar Eriksson opens our pages with what I believe to be his finest
work — and given that his previous stories include "Long Watch,"
that is no small claim. "The Archivist of Endings" is a story about a
man whose task is to record the slow death of a generation ship, and it
is as beautiful and as devastating as anything we have published. It set
the tone for this entire issue, and once I had read it, I knew what
kind of November we would have.

Franklin Hoyt follows with a political story that is also, unexpectedly,
an elegy — for a kind of democracy that may already be slipping away.
Theodore Cain offers a quiet, nearly plotless piece that proves once
again that the most versatile writer in science fiction can surprise you
when you least expect it. Rex Drummond — yes, Rex Drummond — has
written a story with actual emotional depth, and I say that with
admiration rather than surprise, because I always suspected it was in
him. Margaret Thornton gives us alien botany that is rather more
unsettling than it first appears. And Father Aquino brings us a priest
who can see tomorrow and wishes he could not.

Six stories about endings, legacies, and the stubborn human refusal to
go gently. Read them as the light fades and the year turns toward its
own conclusion.

I will see you in December, with our holiday issue.

Yours in the amber light,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond

                      THE ARCHIVIST OF ENDINGS

                        by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The death of a generation ship is not a single event. It is a process,
measured in decades, catalogued in the failing of systems and the
quieting of corridors, and Nils Borg had made it his life's work to
record every stage of it.

He sat at his desk in the Archive, a narrow room on Deck Seven of the
Twilight Procession, and opened the leather-bound register to the next
blank page. The register was one of forty-seven identical volumes that
lined the shelf behind him, their spines numbered in his careful hand.
Each one contained, in ink that would outlast every electronic system
aboard, the record of what had been lost.

Entry 11,407. October 14, Year 312 of Transit. Atmospheric recycler
unit C-17, Deck Twelve, port side. Failed at 03:42 ship time.
Irrepairable. Deck Twelve air quality now maintained by units C-14
and C-19 only. Estimated remaining service life of surviving units:
four to seven years.

He wrote slowly, forming each letter with the deliberation of a man
who understood that permanence was a kind of respect. The fountain pen
had been his grandfather's — a man Borg had never met, who had died on
Deck Nine during the second century of transit, who existed now only as
an entry in Volume Nineteen and as the weight of this pen in his hand.

The ship hummed around him. It was a diminished hum, thinner than it
had been even five years ago, the way an old man's breathing thins
toward the end. Borg could hear the individual frequencies now — the
ventilation cycling through the surviving ducts, the distant pulse of
the reactor on its reduced output, the faint creak of the hull as the
ship moved through the interstellar medium at a velocity that was, for
all practical purposes, indistinguishable from stillness.

They were still forty-one years from Kepler-442b. Forty-one years,
at their current velocity, which could not be increased because the
drive had been operating at diminished capacity since Year 289. The
ship had been designed for a three-hundred-year crossing. They were
twelve years past that estimate, and every system aboard knew it the
way an old body knows it has exceeded its warranty.

Borg closed the register and placed the pen in its holder. Through the
small porthole above his desk — one of the few that still had a clear
view, the others having been sealed against micro-impacts or simply
gone dark — he could see the stars. They were the same stars he had
always seen. The same stars his father had seen, and his father's
father. The Twilight Procession moved so slowly, relative to the
cosmos, that the constellations had barely shifted in three centuries.
The sky was patient. The sky did not care whether they arrived.

He stood and put on his coat. It was cold on Deck Seven. It was cold
everywhere now. The heating allocation had been reduced again in the
last rationing cycle, and Borg wore two sweaters beneath his coat and
still felt the chill settle into his bones each evening. He was
fifty-seven years old. His joints ached in the cold. His father's
joints had ached the same way, in the same cold, on the same deck,
before the pneumonia took him in Year 298.

He locked the Archive and walked out into the corridor.

                               II.

The corridors of the Twilight Procession had once accommodated four
thousand people. Borg knew this because the Archive contained the
original manifest, a document so thick it required its own shelf. Four
thousand souls had boarded the ship at the Lagrange Point docks in
Year Zero, their names and professions and ages recorded in the neat
typeface of the departure authority, and for the first two centuries
the population had remained roughly stable — births balancing deaths,
each generation replacing the last like waves succeeding waves.

Now there were six hundred and twelve. Borg knew the exact number
because he maintained the census as well as the Archive. Six hundred
and twelve people, spread across the nine decks that were still
habitable, living in spaces designed for seven times their number.
The empty quarters had been sealed off, one by one, as the population
contracted — sealed and catalogued, each closure an entry in Borg's
register. He had recorded the sealing of his childhood home on Deck
Four when his mother died. Entry 9,841. That had been twelve years ago.

He walked past darkened doorways. Some bore the names of their last
occupants on small placards — a tradition that had begun, according
to the Archive, in Year 187, and which Borg maintained with a
calligrapher's care. LINDQVIST. JOHANSSON. PARK. ODUYA. Names of
families that had lived and died in transit, that had never known a
horizon or a wind or the weight of rain. Their descendants, if they
had any, had moved inward, toward the core decks where the heating
still functioned and the lights still held.

Borg paused at a junction where the main corridor branched. To the
left, the passage continued toward the Forward Observation Lounge,
which had been closed since Year 297 when a hull micro-fracture in
that section made it structurally suspect. To the right, the corridor
led toward the medical bay and the residential sections of Deck Seven.
Ahead, a service ladder descended to Deck Eight, where the greenhouses
were.

He went down.

                               III.

The greenhouses were the heart of the ship now, in a way that the
bridge and the engine room had once been. Borg descended the ladder
carefully — the rungs were worn smooth by three centuries of hands,
and the lighting in the shaft was intermittent — and emerged into the
warm, humid air of the growing deck.

Here, at least, there was warmth. The greenhouses consumed a
disproportionate share of the ship's remaining energy allocation, a
fact that the Council debated at every quarterly meeting and resolved
every time in the same way: the greenhouses sustained life. Everything
else was negotiable.

Elsa Mattsson was working among the soybean rows when Borg entered.
She was forty-three, the head botanist, and she tended the crops with
a watchfulness that Borg recognized as akin to his own — the attentive
vigilance of someone who understands that what she cares for is
irreplaceable.

"The C-17 unit is gone," Borg said.

Elsa did not look up from the soil she was testing. "I heard. What does
that leave us on Twelve?"

"Two units. Four to seven years, if they're maintained."

"And if they're not?"

"Then Deck Twelve becomes uninhabitable. Fourteen people will need to
relocate."

Elsa pressed a soil probe into the dark earth and studied the reading.
"We have room. There's always room now." She said it without bitterness.
It was simply the arithmetic of decline: as the population shrank, the
remaining space expanded. They could lose decks faster than they lost
people.

Borg stood among the soybean rows and breathed. The air here was rich,
heavy with photosynthesis and the mineral tang of the hydroponic
solution. It was the closest thing to a natural smell that anyone aboard
had ever experienced, though none of them had any basis for comparison.
Borg had read descriptions of Earth's forests in the Archive — accounts
written by the original passengers, people who had actually stood among
trees — and he had tried to imagine what it was like to breathe air that
had not been manufactured, that came from a world rather than a system.
He could not do it. The imagination, he had concluded, was bounded by
experience, and his experience was bounded by the hull.

"I've been thinking about the final entry," he said.

Elsa looked at him now. "The final entry in the register?"

"Yes."

"Nils, the ship hasn't ended yet."

"No. But it will. And the Archive must have a final entry, the same way
it had a first one. I've been thinking about what it should say."

Elsa set down her probe and wiped her hands on her canvas apron. The
gesture was deliberate — Borg noticed everything — a way of giving the
conversation her full attention. "You're assuming you'll be the one to
write it."

"I'm fifty-seven. I won't live to see arrival. Very few of us will.
But the Archive will survive, and its last entry should mean something."

"Everything you've written means something. Entry 11,407 means something.
Every atmospheric recycler, every sealed corridor, every name on every
placard — it all means something because you wrote it down."

"That is the record of decline. I'm talking about the ending. The
conclusion. What does the Archivist write when there is nothing left
to archive?"

Elsa studied him with the same careful attention she gave to a plant
showing the first signs of blight. "You're not asking a question about
the Archive, Nils. You're asking a question about yourself."

He did not answer. Outside the greenhouse walls, the ship hummed its
diminished hum, and the stars held their ancient positions, and forty-one
years of emptiness stretched between the Twilight Procession and
the world it had been sent to reach.

                               IV.

The Archive had begun, as all things aboard the Twilight Procession had
begun, with a mandate from the Mission Planning Authority. Document
MPA-7734, dated Year Zero, Day One: "An official record shall be
maintained of all significant events, system changes, births, deaths,
and operational milestones occurring during the transit period. This
record shall be kept in both electronic and physical formats. A
designated Archivist shall be appointed by the Ship's Council."

The first Archivist had been Margarethe Borg. Nils's great-great-great-
grandmother. She had boarded the ship with a trunk of blank registers
and a case of fountain pens, and she had written the first entry on the
day of departure:

Entry 1. Year Zero, Day One. The Twilight Procession has departed the
Lagrange Point construction facility. All systems nominal. Four thousand
and seventeen souls aboard. Destination: Kepler-442b. Estimated transit
time: 300 years. May those who arrive remember those who departed.

Nils had read that entry so many times that it lived in his memory like
a prayer. May those who arrive remember those who departed. It was the
closest thing to a creed that the Borg family possessed, and it had
guided every Archivist since — seven generations of them, each one
inheriting the register and the pen and the obligation to bear witness.

His father, Anders Borg, had been the sixth Archivist. He had served
for thirty-one years and had written entries 7,203 through 9,166 — a
span that encompassed what the history texts called the Crisis of the
Third Century, when the main drive suffered a catastrophic partial
failure that added an estimated forty years to the transit time. Anders
had recorded the event with characteristic restraint:

Entry 7,449. Year 289, Day 47. Main drive output has stabilized at
sixty-two percent of nominal capacity following the plasma containment
breach of Day 41. Chief Engineer Olsson estimates that the reduced
output will extend transit time by approximately 38 to 44 years.
Council has convened emergency session. Ship population: 1,247.

Borg remembered the day his father had written that entry. He had been
fourteen years old, and he had stood in the doorway of the Archive
watching his father's hand move across the page with its usual
steadiness, and he had understood for the first time that the pen did
not tremble because it could not afford to. The Archive was the only
record that would outlast them all. It had to be clear. It had to be
steady. It had to be true.

Anders Borg had died of pneumonia in Year 298, and Nils had written
the entry for his father's death in the register that his father had
kept for three decades:

Entry 9,167. Year 298, Day 203. Anders Eriksson Borg, Sixth Archivist,
has died. Age 72. Cause: pneumonia, secondary to chronic respiratory
insufficiency. He served the Archive for thirty-one years and the ship
for all seventy-two of them. He is survived by his son, Nils, who
assumes the duties of Seventh Archivist effective this date.

He had not added anything personal. The Archive was not a diary. It was
a record, and records required precision, not sentiment. But he had
sat at the desk for a long time after writing it, holding the pen, and
the ship had been very quiet.

                               V.

Council met on the first day of each month in the Assembly Room on Deck
Six, which had once been a lecture hall and now served as the sole
gathering space for the ship's governance. Borg attended every meeting,
as every Archivist had, to record the proceedings.

Councillor Vasara called the session to order. There were nine
councillors, elected from among the six hundred and twelve, and they
sat at a curved table that was far too large for them — it had been
built for a council of twenty-five. The empty chairs were not removed.
Nothing was removed. Things were sealed, decommissioned, powered down,
but nothing was removed, because removal implied a decision about the
future that no one felt entitled to make.

"The atmospheric recycler on Deck Twelve," Vasara said. She was seventy,
the oldest serving councillor, and she spoke with the directness of a
woman who had attended too many meetings about declining systems to
waste time on preamble. "Archivist Borg has recorded the failure. Chief
Engineer Tanaka will report on the implications."

Tanaka was young — thirty-two, the youngest chief engineer in the ship's
history, a distinction that reflected not exceptional talent but a
diminishing pool of trained personnel. He stood and spoke clearly,
though Borg could see the tension in his hands.

"C-17 failed due to compressor seal degradation. The seals are original
equipment — three hundred and twelve years old. We don't have
replacements. We can't fabricate them with our current manufacturing
capability. C-14 and C-19 on the same deck are showing similar wear
patterns. I estimate four to seven years before one or both fail."

"Can we extend the life of the surviving units?" asked Councillor Holm.

"We can clean them, reduce the air volume they service, limit access
to Deck Twelve. That might buy us a year or two at the margins. But
the fundamental problem is material fatigue. These systems were designed
for a three-hundred-year service life. We are in Year 312."

The room was quiet. Borg wrote in his notebook — not the register,
but the working notes he used to draft his entries. He wrote down
Tanaka's words exactly. Exactness was the only tribute he could pay
to the seriousness of the situation.

Vasara spoke again. "We will begin relocation planning for Deck Twelve
residents. Archivist Borg, please coordinate the documentation."

"Yes, Councillor."

"And Archivist — how many decks have we sealed now?"

Borg did not need to consult his records. "Nine. Decks One through
Three, Deck Five, the upper sections of Decks Six and Ten, and the
forward compartments of Decks Eleven and Fourteen."

"How many remain habitable?"

"Nine decks retain partial or full habitability. But several of those
are marginal. Deck Twelve will be the tenth lost, when it goes."

Vasara nodded. She was a practical woman, and she received information
the way a navigator receives a position fix: not with emotion, but
with the understanding that the next decision must be based on where
one actually was, not where one wished to be.

"Forty-one years," she said. It was not a question. It was the number
that hung over every deliberation, every rationing decision, every
conversation aboard the Twilight Procession. Forty-one years to
Kepler-442b. Forty-one years of a ship that was thirty-plus years past
its design life. The arithmetic was not encouraging, and everyone in
the room could do it.

                               VI.

After Council, Borg walked the ship. He did this every evening — a
circuit of the habitable decks that took him two hours and that served
both as exercise and as inspection. He carried a notebook and recorded
anything he observed: a flickering light panel, a change in the sound
of a ventilation unit, a new crack in a corridor wall. The ship spoke
to him in the language of its deterioration, and he had learned to
listen.

Deck Six. The Assembly Room. The small library, its shelves half-empty
since the paper recycling initiative of Year 278, when a third of the
physical books had been pulped to provide material for essential
documents. Borg had recorded each title before it was destroyed. The
surviving books were behind glass now, treated like relics, which is
what they were.

Deck Seven. His own deck. The Archive. The medical bay, where Dr.
Sorrenson tended the health of six hundred and twelve people with
equipment that was designed for four thousand and was failing in ways
that mirrored everything else. Sorrenson was good. Sorrenson was
careful. But Sorrenson could not fabricate replacement parts for a
surgical laser any more than Tanaka could fabricate replacement seals
for an atmospheric recycler.

Deck Eight. The greenhouses. Borg paused here, as he always did, and
stood among the growing things and breathed. The warmth. The smell. The
impossible green. This deck, he sometimes thought, was the only part of
the ship that was still fully alive — not merely functioning, but
growing, reaching, producing. Everything else was in various stages of
a long, slow arrest.

Deck Nine. Residential. The most densely populated deck now, because
it was the warmest and the most structurally sound. Families lived here,
children played in corridors that echoed with their voices in a way
that corridors were not meant to echo — too much space for too few
people, the sound carrying farther than it should, as if the ship
itself were amplifying the evidence of its emptiness.

He passed a doorway where a small girl sat reading by the light of
a hand-crank lamp. She looked up and said, "Good evening, Archivist."

"Good evening, Karin."

"Are you writing tonight?"

"I write every night."

"What will you write about?"

"Whatever the ship tells me."

She considered this with the gravity of an eight-year-old for whom the
Archivist was a figure of some mystery. "Does the ship talk to you?"

"In its way."

"What does it say?"

Borg paused. He looked at the child, who was wrapped in a blanket
against the chill, whose entire world was this corridor, this deck,
this slowly failing vessel, and who would be forty-nine years old when
the ship reached its destination — if it reached its destination — and
who might or might not live to set foot on a world she had never seen.

"It says to keep going," he said.

Karin nodded, as if this were a satisfactory answer, and returned to
her book.

                               VII.

In the Archive, alone, with the door closed and the lamp turned low,
Borg opened Volume Forty-Seven and began the day's entries.

He wrote about the recycler failure. He wrote about the Council meeting.
He wrote about the relocation plan for Deck Twelve. He wrote with the
precision that the Archive demanded and the steadiness that his family
had cultivated for seven generations, and when he was finished with the
factual record he sat back and looked at the page and felt the weight
of everything he had not written.

The Archive did not contain feelings. It did not contain opinions, or
fears, or the sound of a child's voice asking what the ship said. It
contained facts: dates, systems, numbers, names. It was a skeleton of
the ship's life, stripped of flesh, and it was exactly what it had been
designed to be, and sometimes Borg wondered whether it was enough.

He opened his personal journal — a separate book, not part of the
official Archive, which he kept in a locked drawer. Every Archivist had
kept one, a tradition as old as the position itself. The personal
journals were not part of the record. They were the shadow of the
record, the place where the Archivist could be a person rather than a
function.

He wrote:

I have been thinking about the final entry for six months now, and I
am no closer to knowing what it should say. The problem is not what to
write about — it is what to write for. Who will read the last entry in
the Archive? If we reach Kepler-442b, the Archive will become a
historical document, and the final entry will be the last line of a
story with an ending. If we do not reach it — if the ship fails, if
the systems give out, if the hull breaches, if the reactor goes cold —
then the Archive will be a message in a bottle that no one will ever
find, drifting between stars in a tomb of metal and silence.

Either way, the last entry must be worthy of what came before. Eleven
thousand four hundred and seven entries. Three hundred and twelve years.
Seven Archivists. Four thousand and seventeen souls who boarded, and
the thousands more who were born and lived and died in transit. The
final entry must hold all of that, somehow, in the space of a few
lines.

I do not know how to do this.

He closed the journal and locked the drawer. The ship hummed. The stars
held still. In the corridor outside, the lights dimmed to their night
cycle, and the Twilight Procession continued its slow passage through
the dark, carrying its Archive and its Archivist and its six hundred
and twelve souls toward a destination they might or might not reach,
at a speed that was nearly indistinguishable from standing still.

                               VIII.

The funeral was on a Tuesday.

Councillor Vasara died in her sleep, quietly, in the way that Borg had
come to recognize as the ship's most common death: the body simply
deciding, after decades of cold and diminished nutrition and the subtle
radiation that seeped through the aging hull shielding, that it had
done enough. She was seventy years old. She had served on the Council
for twenty-two years. She had been born on Deck Four, in the same
corridor where Borg had grown up, and she had never seen a sunset or
a mountain or the face of anyone who had not also been born inside
this hull.

Borg stood at the back of the Assembly Room and recorded the funeral in
his notebook. Sixty-three people attended — roughly one in ten of the
ship's population, which was a respectable turnout. The ship's chaplain,
a woman named Okoro who maintained the nondenominational spiritual
practice that had evolved over three centuries from the diverse religions
of the original passengers, spoke the words of the Transit Rite:

"We commit Astrid Vasara to the stars from which we came and toward
which we travel. She was born in transit, she lived in transit, and she
dies in transit. She carried the journey in her bones, as we all do.
May the journey carry her now."

The body would be recycled. This was not spoken of in the ceremony,
but everyone knew it. On a generation ship, nothing was wasted —
not air, not water, not the carbon and calcium and phosphorus of a
human body. Vasara would become soil in the greenhouses, would feed
the soybeans and the lettuce and the small, stubborn tomato plants that
Elsa Mattsson coaxed from seeds that were themselves three hundred
years old. It was the most practical form of immortality, and Vasara,
who had been above all things a practical woman, would have approved.

Borg wrote the entry that evening:

Entry 11,412. Year 312, Day 19. Astrid Linnea Vasara, Councillor,
has died. Age 70. Cause: cardiac arrest during sleep. She served on
the Ship's Council for twenty-two years and was instrumental in the
rationing reforms of Year 294 and the deck consolidation program of
Year 303. She is survived by her son, Erik, and her granddaughter,
Karin.

He paused. Karin. The girl in the corridor with the hand-crank lamp.
Vasara's granddaughter. He had not known that.

He added nothing else. The Archive was not a diary.

                               IX.

But that night, in his personal journal, he wrote:

Vasara is dead, and she deserved better than an entry number and a
cause of death. She deserved a paragraph, at least — something that
captured the way she leaned forward when she listened, as though
every speaker were saying the most important thing she had ever heard.
Something about her hands, which were large and calloused from the
years she spent working in the greenhouses before she entered politics.
Something about the way she said "forty-one years" at Council today —
not with despair, not with hope, but with the matter-of-fact acceptance
of a woman who understood that the distance between the ship and its
destination was simply a fact, like the temperature or the air pressure,
and that facts were to be dealt with rather than mourned.

But the Archive does not accommodate such things. The Archive is a
record of what happened, not of what it felt like, and perhaps that is
as it should be. The feelings are mine. The record belongs to everyone.

And yet I wonder, when someone reads these volumes on Kepler-442b — if
someone does — whether they will understand what it was like. Whether
the numbers and the dates and the system failures will convey the
texture of life aboard a ship that is older than any living memory,
that has been dying for decades, that keeps going anyway because the
only alternative to keeping going is not keeping going, and that is
unacceptable.

I think they will not understand. I think the Archive will be studied
and respected and cited in historical papers, and I think the reality
of what it was like to live here will be as remote to those readers as
the reality of ancient Rome is to me. The documents survive. The
experience does not.

This is the limitation of all records. And it is the limitation I must
somehow overcome in the final entry.

                               X.

Months passed. The ship continued its slow transit. Systems failed and
were recorded. People died and were recorded. The population of the
Twilight Procession dropped to six hundred and four, then to five
hundred and ninety-seven, and Borg adjusted the census and wrote the
entries and maintained the Archive with the same steadiness that six
Archivists before him had maintained it, because steadiness was the
Archivist's duty and the Archive's requirement and, perhaps, the only
thing that kept the darkness at bay.

Deck Twelve was sealed. Borg recorded it: Entry 11,438. He wrote the
names of the fourteen families who relocated, and the inventory of
systems that were powered down, and the status of the corridor placards,
which he transferred to a new section in Volume Forty-Seven so that
the names of Deck Twelve's dead would not be lost when the deck itself
went dark.

The greenhouses lost a lighting array. Elsa Mattsson rerouted power
from a decommissioned recreational facility and kept the plants alive.
Borg recorded it.

A child was born — the first in seven months. Borg recorded it: a girl,
named Astrid, after the dead Councillor. Born on Deck Nine. Weight:
2.8 kilograms, which was low but within the range that Dr. Sorrenson
considered acceptable for a shipborn child in the current nutritional
environment.

Borg wrote it all down. He wrote it clearly and precisely and without
sentiment, and each evening he returned to his personal journal and
wrote the things the Archive could not hold: the weight of the silence
in the sealed corridors, the sound of Karin's voice reading aloud to
her newborn neighbor, the way Elsa's hands trembled when she thought
no one was looking, the particular quality of light in the greenhouse
when the aging lamps caught the moisture in the air and made it glow
like something remembered from a world none of them had ever known.

                               XI.

And then, on a night when the ship was quieter than usual and the stars
through his porthole seemed both closer and more distant than they had
ever been, Borg opened Volume Forty-Seven to the next blank page and
understood what the final entry must be.

Not the last entry he would write. He would write many more before he
died, and whoever succeeded him — if anyone did — would write more
after that. But the final entry. The one he would write and seal in an
envelope and place inside the front cover of Volume One, to be read
when the Archive was complete. When the ship had either arrived or
had not. When the story was finished.

He uncapped his grandfather's pen. He held it for a long time,
feeling its weight, which was the weight of seven generations and
three centuries and four thousand and seventeen souls and the entire
improbable, stubborn, beautiful enterprise of crossing the void between
stars in a vessel made of metal and hope.

And he wrote:

Final Entry. Prepared by Nils Borg, Seventh Archivist of the
Twilight Procession.

To whoever reads this:

The ship was dying when I wrote these words, and it had been dying
for a long time. The systems that sustained us were failing, one by
one, and I recorded each failure with the precision that the Archive
demands, because precision is a form of respect, and these failures
deserved respect. They were the last acts of machines that had
worked for three centuries, longer than any machine was ever asked
to work, and they gave out not from defect but from exhaustion, the
way a heart gives out after a long life.

I cannot tell you whether the ship survived to reach Kepler-442b. If
you are reading this on that world, then you know the answer, and
this Archive is a record of a journey completed. If you are reading
this somewhere else — recovered from the wreck, perhaps, or
transmitted by the emergency beacon that I hope will outlast the
ship itself — then you know a different answer, and this Archive is
a record of a journey that ended short of its destination.

Either way, I want you to know what the numbers do not convey.

We were afraid. We were cold. The corridors were too empty and the
silence was too large and the stars did not move and the years were
very long. We buried our dead in the soil of the greenhouses and
ate what grew from that soil and understood, in a way that perhaps
no other humans have understood, that life is a cycle of the most
literal kind.

And we kept going. Not because we were brave — though some of us
were — but because the journey was all we had. We were born in
transit. We lived in transit. Our parents and grandparents and
great-grandparents lived and died in transit. The ship was our
world, the only one we knew, and we maintained it the way you
maintain a world: imperfectly, desperately, with whatever tools
and skills and stubbornness we possessed.

The Archive contains the facts. Eleven thousand entries and
counting, each one a small act of witness. I have tried to make
them accurate and clear and worthy of the people and the systems
they describe. But the Archive does not contain the sound of
children in the corridors. It does not contain the smell of the
greenhouses, or the warmth of the growing deck on a cold night,
or the way Elsa Mattsson talked to her plants as though they could
hear her, which perhaps they could. It does not contain the weight
of a pen that has been passed from hand to hand for seven
generations, or the silence of the stars, or the feeling of
looking through a porthole and knowing that the light you see left
its source before you were born and will arrive at its destination
after you are dead.

These things I leave to you to imagine. And I ask you — whoever
you are, wherever you are, however many years have passed — to
imagine them. To read the numbers and the dates and the system
failures, and to understand that behind each entry was a life, and
behind each life was a world no larger than a ship, and behind that
ship was the stubbornest thing in the universe, which is the refusal
to stop.

May those who arrive remember those who departed.

Nils Borg
Seventh Archivist
Year 312 of Transit, aboard the Twilight Procession,
forty-one years from home.

He sealed the letter in an envelope. He wrote on the front: TO BE
PLACED IN VOLUME ONE UPON MY DEATH OR THE COMPLETION OF THE VOYAGE,
WHICHEVER COMES FIRST.

He placed it in the Archive's lockbox, beside the six sealed envelopes
left by the six Archivists before him. Each of them had written a final
entry. Each of them had faced the same question and answered it in
their own way, and Borg had never opened any of them, because the final
entries were for the end, not for the middle.

He closed the lockbox. He returned to the register. He opened it to
the next blank page and wrote:

Entry 11,459. Year 312, Day 247. All systems nominal at reduced
capacity. Ship population: 594. Greenhouse output stable. No
significant events to report.

The ship hummed. The stars held still. The Twilight Procession
continued on, carrying its Archive and its Archivist and its five
hundred and ninety-four souls through the dark, toward a world none
of them had seen, at a speed that was nearly indistinguishable from
faith.

================================================================================

                        THE LAST CAMPAIGN

                         by Franklin Hoyt

================================================================================

                               I.

Senator Marcus Webb was seventy-three years old, and he was tired of
winning.

Not tired of victory in the way that young men claimed to be — that
performative exhaustion that was really just another kind of boasting.
Webb was tired in his bones, in the part of himself that had once
believed that the act of campaigning was itself a form of democracy,
that the handshake and the speech and the argument on the courthouse
steps mattered not just because they produced a winner but because
they produced a citizenry that had participated in its own governance.

That was over now. Had been over for a decade, if he was honest. The
Predictive Electoral Models had seen to that.

He sat in his office in the Russell Building — still called that,
though the building had been renamed twice and the Senate itself had
been reorganized three times in his forty-year career — and looked out
the window at the Mall. The Washington Monument. The Capitol dome. The
old symbols of a republic that still called itself a republic, that
still held elections every two years, that still counted votes and
certified results and inaugurated winners. Everything looked the same.
Everything functioned. The machinery of democracy was intact.

It was just that the democracy had left the building.

"Senator." His chief of staff, Diane Okafor, stood in the doorway.
She was forty-five, efficient, loyal, and she had worked for Webb long
enough to know that when he stared out the window for more than ten
minutes, he was either making a decision or mourning something.
Sometimes both.

"How are the numbers?" Webb asked, without turning.

"MERIDIAN has you at 34.7 percent likelihood of retention. ORACLE
gives you 31.2. PYTHIA — which is the one the networks use — has you
at 29.8." She paused. "Those are the worst numbers you've had in
forty years."

"I know."

"The models are recommending that you concede preemptively. There's a
protocol for it now — the Graceful Transition Framework. You announce
three months before the election, the models adjust, your successor
is identified through the compatibility algorithms, and the whole
thing is wrapped up without the expense and disruption of an actual
campaign."

Webb turned from the window. "I know what the Graceful Transition
Framework is, Diane. I voted against its authorization."

"You and eleven others. It passed 89 to 11."

"I can count."

"Marcus." She dropped the formality, which she did only when she was
about to say something he needed to hear. "The models are not wrong.
They haven't been wrong in six election cycles. Not once. Not a single
seat, not a single state, not a single margin. They predict outcomes
with 99.7 percent accuracy, and the one time they were off — Sinclair
in Montana — it was by half a percentage point. You cannot beat the
models."

"I know I can't beat the models," Webb said. "I'm not trying to beat
the models. I'm trying to ignore them."

                               II.

The Predictive Electoral Models had arrived in American politics in
2031, and they had devoured it in less than a decade.

The technology was not complicated, in principle. Machine learning
algorithms trained on every available data point — voting records,
census data, consumer behavior, social media activity, physiological
data from wearable devices, movement patterns, purchasing decisions,
media consumption, emotional sentiment analysis, and a thousand other
inputs that most citizens had consented to share without quite
understanding what they were sharing — could predict electoral outcomes
with a precision that made polling look like astrology.

At first, the models were used the way polls had been used: as tools
for campaigns, strategic instruments that helped candidates allocate
resources and craft messages. But the models were too good for that.
They didn't just predict how people would vote. They predicted with
near-certainty who would win, in every race, at every level, months
before the election. And once that information was public — and the
courts had ruled that it must be public, under the Transparency in
Electoral Forecasting Act of 2034 — the nature of elections changed
fundamentally.

Why campaign when the outcome was known? Why debate when the models
had already determined which candidate's arguments would prevail with
which demographics? Why vote when your individual ballot was, in the
mathematical sense, irrelevant — not because it didn't count, but
because the models had already counted it, along with everyone else's,
and the result was a matter of statistical certainty?

Voter turnout had dropped from 62 percent to 19 percent in three
election cycles. Campaign spending had collapsed by 80 percent.
Debates had become ceremonial — scripted exchanges performed for the
historical record, watched by fewer people than tuned in for the
weather. The parties still existed, still nominated candidates, still
held conventions, but the conventions had the atmosphere of trade shows
rather than political events, because everyone in the hall already
knew who would win and by how much.

Webb had watched it happen. He had given speeches about it, written
op-eds, proposed legislation. He had argued that democracy was not a
system for producing optimal outcomes — it was a system for producing
legitimate ones, and legitimacy required participation, and
participation required uncertainty. If the outcome was known in
advance, the election was not an election. It was a formality. And a
republic that governed by formality was a republic in name only.

Nobody had listened. Or rather, people had listened, had nodded, had
agreed in principle, and had then checked the models to see whether
Webb's proposed reforms had any chance of passing, and the models had
said no, and so the reforms had died in committee, their failure
predicted to the decimal point before they were even introduced.

                               III.

"I'm going to run," Webb said. "The old way."

Diane sat down. This was not a good sign. Diane Okafor did not sit
down unless she was settling in for a long argument.

"Define 'the old way,'" she said.

"Rallies. Town halls. Door-to-door canvassing. Debates — real debates,
not the scripted theater. Handshakes. Speeches. Arguments. I want to
stand in front of actual voters and make my case and let them decide,
and I don't want anyone in my campaign to look at the models or cite
the models or even acknowledge the models exist."

"Marcus, that's — "

"Quixotic. I know. I've read the editorials."

"I was going to say 'expensive.' You're proposing to run a
twentieth-century campaign in a twenty-first-century system. Do you
have any idea what that costs? When was the last time anyone rented
a rally venue? Printed yard signs? Paid for a bus tour?"

"That's exactly my point. The infrastructure of democratic campaigning
has atrophied because the models made it unnecessary. I want to
rebuild it. Not because it'll change the outcome — I know what the
models say, and I know the models are probably right — but because the
act of campaigning matters. The act of asking for someone's vote, face
to face, matters. The act of making your case in a room full of people
who might disagree with you matters. Democracy isn't an algorithm. It's
a conversation."

Diane was quiet for a moment. She was a pragmatist, which was why Webb
had hired her, and she was also a patriot, which was why she had stayed.

"The models will call this a stunt," she said.

"The models can't call anything. They're math. The pundits will call
it a stunt. Let them."

"Your opponent — whoever the compatibility algorithms select — will
have a fully optimized, model-driven campaign. Targeted messaging,
behavioral nudges, precision resource allocation. Everything calibrated
to the decimal point."

"Good. I want the contrast. I want people to see what an election used
to look like and what it looks like now, and I want them to decide
which one they prefer."

"They'll prefer the one that works. People always prefer the one that
works."

"Maybe. Or maybe they'll remember what it felt like to be asked. To
be courted. To have a senator show up in their town and look them in
the eye and say, 'I want your vote, and here's why I deserve it.' When
was the last time any of them experienced that?"

Diane opened her mouth to answer, and then closed it, because the
answer was that she did not know, and that was, in its own way, the
most persuasive argument Webb had made.

                               IV.

The campaign began in March, eight months before the election.

Webb's opponent was a woman named Priya Dasgupta, forty-one years old,
a former data scientist who had entered politics through the model-
management sector — the growing bureaucracy of analysts and technicians
who maintained the predictive systems and translated their outputs
into policy recommendations. She was intelligent, composed, and
thoroughly modern, and she had been selected by the party's
compatibility algorithm as the optimal candidate for Webb's district:
the person most likely to win, based on the same data that predicted
Webb's defeat.

Dasgupta ran a model-driven campaign. This meant, in practice, that she
hardly campaigned at all. Her team released precisely calibrated
statements at intervals determined by sentiment analysis. She appeared
at events that the models indicated would maximize favorable media
coverage. She did not hold town halls, because the models showed that
town halls produced unpredictable outcomes and therefore introduced
unnecessary risk. She did not knock on doors, because the models had
already identified every persuadable voter and sent them personalized
digital content that was more effective than any human interaction.

Webb knocked on doors.

He started in the old neighborhoods — the parts of the district that
the models classified as "low-engagement zones," which meant that the
residents had largely stopped voting and therefore received almost no
attention from model-driven campaigns. These were the neighborhoods
where the yard signs had disappeared first, where the polling places
had been consolidated and then closed, where democracy had receded like
a tide going out, leaving behind the detritus of a civic life that no
longer functioned.

He knocked on a door in Brightwood. A man named Gerald Tyson opened it
and stared at him.

"I'm Senator Marcus Webb," Webb said. "I'm running for reelection, and
I'd like to talk to you about it."

Tyson was sixty-two, retired, and he looked at Webb the way a man
looks at something he hasn't seen in so long he's forgotten what it is.

"A senator," Tyson said. "At my door."

"At your door."

"I haven't voted in — " Tyson paused, calculating. "Eight years? Maybe
ten."

"I know. That's why I'm here."

"The models say you're going to lose."

"The models say a lot of things. I'm here to say something different.
Can I come in?"

Tyson opened the door.

                               V.

He talked to Gerald Tyson for forty-five minutes. He talked about the
models, and about what the models had replaced, and about the
difference between an election and a prediction. He talked about the
Senate, and about how it had changed in his forty years, and about
the precise moment when he realized that his colleagues had stopped
trying to persuade each other because the models had already
determined how every vote would go. He talked about legitimacy, and
consent, and the difference between a government that was selected
by an algorithm and a government that was chosen by its citizens.

Tyson listened. He asked questions. He disagreed about some things
and agreed about others, and when Webb left, Tyson said, "I don't
know if I'll vote for you, Senator. But I'll vote."

Webb shook his hand and walked to the next house.

It was slow work. Exhausting work. Webb was seventy-three, and his
knees ached and his voice gave out by evening and he went to bed each
night in his small apartment near the Capitol feeling every one of his
years. The models updated daily, and his numbers did not improve. The
pundits covered his campaign with a mixture of condescension and
nostalgia, the way one might cover the last practitioner of an obsolete
craft — interesting as a curiosity, irrelevant as a political strategy.

But something happened in the neighborhoods.

People came to the door. Not all of them — not even most of them — but
enough that Webb noticed, and enough that Diane noticed, and enough
that the reporters who accompanied him began to notice too. There was
a hunger in those doorways, a surprise that was also a kind of grief,
the recognition of something that had been lost so gradually that
its absence had become invisible. People wanted to be asked. They
wanted to argue. They wanted to feel that their participation in
their own governance was not a formality but a necessity, that their
vote was not a data point but a decision.

A woman in Adams Morgan said, "I forgot what this felt like. Being
asked."

A man in Anacostia said, "My father used to take me to the polling
place. It felt important. Like church."

A teenager in Petworth said, "I've never seen a politician in person
before. I thought they were — I don't know. A thing on a screen."

Webb held rallies. Small ones, in community centers and church
basements and parking lots, the kinds of spaces that had once been
the infrastructure of democratic participation and were now used for
other things or not used at all. He spoke without a teleprompter,
without model-optimized talking points, without sentiment-calibrated
language. He spoke the way he had spoken in his first campaign, forty
years ago, when he was thirty-three and idealistic and believed that
politics was the art of persuasion rather than the science of
prediction.

The crowds were small. Fifty people. Seventy. Once, in a union hall in
Northeast, a hundred and twelve. They were not the kinds of crowds that
the models considered significant. But the people in those crowds were
doing something that the models had not predicted, because the models
had not been trained on it: they were participating.

                               VI.

Dasgupta's team noticed. The models noticed. Webb's numbers did not
improve — the models were clear about that, and the models were almost
certainly correct — but something else was changing, something the
models measured but did not fully account for: engagement. In the
neighborhoods Webb visited, voter registration ticked upward. Not by
much — a percent here, two percent there — but in a system that had
seen nothing but decline for a decade, any increase was anomalous.

Dasgupta requested a debate. A real debate, not the scripted kind. Her
team calculated that refusing would create a narrative of avoidance
that could affect her margins in educated suburban precincts, and so
she agreed to meet Webb on a stage, in a format that neither the models
nor the algorithms had designed, and to argue.

It was held in a high school gymnasium. There were four hundred people
in the audience, which was the largest political gathering Webb's
district had seen in six years. There were cameras, but the broadcast
attracted a modest audience — the networks no longer devoted significant
resources to political events whose outcomes were already known.

Webb spoke first. He was old and his voice was hoarse and he gripped
the podium with both hands, and he said:

"I am going to lose this election. The models are clear about that,
and I don't dispute their accuracy. They are very good at predicting
what will happen. What they cannot predict — what no algorithm can
predict — is what should happen. And what should happen is this: you
should decide. Not a model. Not an algorithm. Not a compatibility
matrix or a behavioral nudge or a predictive framework. You. Each of
you. In a voting booth, alone with your conscience, making a choice
that is yours and no one else's.

"I have been in the Senate for forty years. I have watched this body
transform from a deliberative institution into a ratification engine
for algorithmic outputs. I have watched my colleagues stop arguing,
stop persuading, stop believing that their words could change anyone's
mind, because the models had already determined every outcome. I have
watched voter turnout drop to nineteen percent and been told that this
is efficient — that the models have simply eliminated the friction
from the process, the way you might eliminate friction from a machine.

"But democracy is not a machine. It is a conversation. It is the
loudest, messiest, most inefficient conversation in human history, and
it is the only system we have ever invented that treats the ordinary
citizen as someone whose judgment matters. The models do not treat your
judgment as something that matters. They treat it as a data point. They
have already counted your vote. They have already decided the outcome.
They have left you with nothing to do but ratify their prediction — or
stay home, which is what most of you have done, and I do not blame you,
because why would you participate in a process that does not need you?

"I am here tonight because I believe it needs you. I believe this
republic needs your anger and your hope and your disagreement and your
stubborn, irrational, unpredictable humanity. I believe that a
government predicted by a model is not the same as a government chosen
by a people. And I believe that if we surrender the act of choosing to
the machines that can predict our choices, we will have lost something
that cannot be recovered by any algorithm, no matter how sophisticated.

"I am asking for your vote. Not because the models say I will win. They
say I will lose. I am asking for your vote because the asking is the
point. The asking is democracy. And if we stop asking, we stop being a
republic, no matter what we call ourselves.

"That's all I have. Thank you."

The gymnasium was quiet. Four hundred people sat in folding chairs
under fluorescent lights and did not speak, and in that silence Webb
heard something he had not heard in a very long time: the sound of
people thinking.

                               VII.

Dasgupta spoke well. She was intelligent and articulate and she made
the case for the models with precision and conviction: they produced
better outcomes, reduced campaign waste, eliminated the distortions of
money and media, and ensured that the most qualified candidates
governed. She was right about all of it. The models did produce better
outcomes, by any measurable standard. Government functioned more
smoothly. Policy was more rational. Corruption had declined. The
system worked.

Webb did not argue with any of it. He had never argued that the models
produced bad outcomes. He argued that the outcomes were beside the
point.

The debate was watched, in the end, by two hundred thousand people —
a fraction of the district's population, but ten times the audience
for any political event in recent memory. Clips circulated. Webb's
closing statement was transcribed and shared and discussed in a way
that political speech had not been discussed in years.

The models did not change their predictions. Webb was still projected
to lose by a comfortable margin, and the models were almost certainly
correct, because the models were always correct.

But in the weeks that followed, voter registration in the district
increased by 4.3 percent. This was unprecedented. The analysts noted
it, the commentators discussed it, and the models incorporated it into
their projections and confirmed that it did not change the outcome.

Webb continued to campaign. Door to door. Town hall to town hall. He
was seventy-three and exhausted and he knew he was going to lose and he
kept going, because the going was the point.

                               VIII.

Election Day.

Webb voted at 7:00 AM at his local polling place, a school gymnasium
not unlike the one where the debate had been held. There was a line. A
short one — eleven people ahead of him — but a line nonetheless, and
he stood in it like everyone else, and when he reached the booth he
marked his ballot by hand, on paper, in the manner that the law still
required even though the models had rendered the act ceremonial.

He spent the day at his campaign office, which was a rented storefront
in Brightwood — Gerald Tyson's neighborhood. Volunteers came and went.
There were not many of them, but they were earnest and energetic and
several of them were young people who had never worked on a campaign
before because there had been no campaigns to work on.

The results came in at 8:00 PM, which was the same time the models
had predicted they would come in, which was the same time results
always came in. Dasgupta won. The margin was 61.3 to 38.7, which was
within one percentage point of every major model's projection.

Webb had lost.

But.

Voter turnout in the district was 34 percent. It had been 18 percent
in the previous cycle, and 22 percent in the cycle before that. Thirty-
four percent. In a district where the models had called the race eight
months before Election Day. In a system where participation had been
declining for a decade. Thirty-four percent of eligible voters had
gone to the polls and cast ballots in an election whose outcome
everyone already knew.

Diane showed him the number. He looked at it for a long time.

"It doesn't change anything," she said gently.

"It changes everything," Webb said.

                               IX.

He gave his concession speech in the storefront office in Brightwood.
Sixty people were there, including Gerald Tyson, who had voted for the
first time in a decade and who had voted, as he told Webb afterward,
for Dasgupta.

"I liked what you said about the asking," Tyson explained. "But I
looked at both of you and I made my own decision, and my decision was
her. I hope that doesn't offend you."

Webb shook his hand. "That's the most beautiful thing anyone has said
to me in forty years of politics."

He stood before the small crowd and spoke without notes:

"I lost tonight, and the models predicted that I would lose, and the
models were right. They are very good at what they do. But I want to
tell you what I learned in these eight months of doing something that
most people thought was pointless.

"I knocked on one thousand, four hundred and twelve doors. I shook
approximately three thousand hands. I held forty-seven rallies, in
rooms that ranged from church basements to parking lots. I had nine
hundred and six individual conversations with voters, many of whom
had not spoken to a politician, or voted, in years. And what I learned
is this: the hunger has not gone away. The desire to participate, to be
asked, to be treated as a citizen rather than a data point — it is
still there, buried under a decade of algorithmic governance, waiting
for someone to dig it up.

"Thirty-four percent of you voted today. That is not a victory by any
conventional measure. But it is a sign that the conversation is not
over. The models predict. They predict with extraordinary accuracy. But
they do not choose. Only you can choose. And today, more of you chose
to choose than anyone expected.

"I am leaving the Senate. I am seventy-three years old, and this was
my last campaign, and it was the best one. Not because I came close to
winning — I did not come close. But because, for eight months, in a
system that no longer requires it, a senator knocked on doors and
asked for votes, and the people behind those doors remembered what it
felt like to be asked. That is worth a career. That is worth a loss.

"Go home. Talk to your neighbors. Argue with each other. Show up at
the next election, whether the models say it matters or not. That is
all I ask. That is all I have ever asked.

"Thank you. Good night."

He walked out of the storefront and into the November darkness, an old
man in a rumpled suit, and behind him the small crowd applauded — not
loudly, not for long, but with the particular warmth of people who had
been reminded of something they had almost forgotten, and who were not
yet sure what to do with the remembering, but who were grateful for it
all the same.

================================================================================

                      INDIAN SUMMER ON IO

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The shuttle from Ganymede Station put down on the old pad at Sulfur
Creek at half past six in the morning, local time, which on Io meant
nothing at all. There was no morning on Io. There was Jupiter, filling
a quarter of the sky, and there was the pale sun, and there was the
yellow-gray surface stretching out in every direction like a bad dream
about the desert, and there was the radiation, always the radiation,
ticking away on every dosimeter like a clock that only counted down.

Walt Kovacs stepped off the shuttle and stood on the pad and looked
at what was left of the town.

Not much. The main street — if you could call it a street, it had been
a pressurized corridor connecting the hab modules — was still standing,
more or less. The modules themselves were intact, because they were
built to last and because there was nothing on Io to knock them down
except the occasional sulfur eruption, and the engineers who had sited
Sulfur Creek back in '38 had known enough to put it on stable ground.
The comm tower was still up, though its dish was cocked at an angle
that suggested it hadn't tracked a signal in years. The loading dock
where the ore carriers had backed in to take on their loads of
iridium and palladium was empty, its blast shields raised like arms
frozen in surrender.

Kovacs was sixty-seven. He had come to Sulfur Creek when he was
twenty-two, fresh off a labor shuttle from Ceres with a mining
certificate and a pair of boots that didn't fit right. He had worked
the deep tunnels for twenty-three years — the shafts that went down
through the sulfur crust into the silicate mantle where the heavy
metals collected in veins that glittered like frozen lightning in
your headlamp beam. He had breathed recycled air and eaten processed
protein and slept in a bunk that was six feet long and four feet wide
and felt, after a twelve-hour shift at the rock face, like the most
comfortable bed in the solar system.

He'd left in '83, when the mine closed. Everyone left. The company
pulled the extraction equipment and the processing plant and most of
the hab furniture and anything else that had a positive scrap value,
and they left the modules and the corridors and the tunnels and the
memories, because memories had no scrap value, and neither did ghosts.

That had been twelve years ago.

"You sure about this?" the shuttle pilot asked from the hatch. She was
young — couldn't have been more than twenty-five — and she looked at
Sulfur Creek the way you look at a cemetery.

"I'm sure," Kovacs said.

"I'll be back in seventy-two hours. Dosimeter stays green, you'll be
fine. It goes yellow, you get back to the pad and you call me."

"I know the drill."

"No offense, but nobody comes to Io for fun. Especially not to a
dead mine."

"No offense taken."

The shuttle lifted off, and Kovacs was alone on Io, which was a thing
he had not been in twelve years and which felt, to his surprise, like
coming home.

                               II.

The airlock on the main hab still worked, which meant someone had
maintained the seals, or more likely the seals had been over-engineered
to begin with. Mining equipment on Io was built paranoid — triple
redundancies on everything, because the alternative was dying in a
place where nobody could reach you fast enough to matter. Kovacs
cycled through and stepped into the main corridor and turned on his
suit lamp.

The corridor was dark. Power had been cut when the town was
decommissioned, and whatever battery reserves had kept the emergency
lights going had drained years ago. Kovacs's lamp threw a cone of
white light that moved as he moved, picking out details the way memory
picks out moments: the bulletin board on the left wall, still bearing
a faded notice about shift changes that would never happen; the floor
tiles, scuffed by a decade of mining boots, each scuff mark a small
record of a person going somewhere with purpose; the door to the
commissary, propped open with a folded piece of cardboard, the way
it had always been propped open because the latch was broken and
nobody had ever gotten around to fixing it.

He walked slowly. There was no reason to hurry, and every reason not
to. He was here to remember, and remembering takes time.

The commissary. He pushed through the door and stood in the room where
he had eaten ten thousand meals. The tables were still there — bolted
to the floor, too heavy to be worth shipping out. The serving counter
was bare, the kitchen behind it stripped. But the tables were there,
and Kovacs could see them as they had been: crowded, noisy, cluttered
with trays and coffee cups and the elbows of miners who had just come
off shift and were too tired to sit up straight. He could hear them,
almost. The voices. Henriksen, who told the same joke every Tuesday.
Patel, who argued about politics with anyone who would sit still.
Yoko, who ate in silence and read paperback westerns and never said
more than three words at a meal unless directly provoked.

They were scattered across the system now, the ones who were still
alive. Henriksen had gone back to Earth, last Kovacs heard. Patel was
on Mars, teaching school. Yoko — nobody knew about Yoko. She had
dropped off the grid after the mine closed, the way some people do,
not dead but not findable, existing in the spaces between databases
where privacy still lived.

Kovacs sat down at his old table. Third from the left, by the wall.
He could tell it was his because of the initials someone had scratched
into the surface — not his initials, but the initials of a woman named
Maria Espinoza, who had worked the same shift as Kovacs for six years
and who had carved M.E. into the table one night when she was drunk on
the homebrewed potato liquor that circulated through Sulfur Creek's
underground economy. Maria had died on shift in '71, a tunnel collapse
in Shaft Seven. Kovacs had been two hundred meters away when it
happened. He had heard the sound — a low, grinding roar that you felt
in your chest more than your ears — and he had known, immediately,
what it meant, and he had run toward it anyway, the way you run toward
the worst thing that can happen because the worst thing that can happen
is already happening and running away from it doesn't make it stop.

They got her out, but not in time. The official cause of death was
crush trauma. The unofficial cause was Io: the radiation, the
pressure, the sulfur, the sheer grinding hostility of a moon that
did not want human beings on it and had an infinite number of ways
to make that point.

Kovacs traced the initials with his gloved finger. M.E. Maria
Espinoza. She had been thirty-four.

                               III.

He went into the tunnels.

This was the part of the pilgrimage — and he understood now that it
was a pilgrimage, that it had always been going to be a pilgrimage,
that the word he had been avoiding was the word that fit — that he had
come for. The tunnels were the reason Sulfur Creek existed. The tunnels
were where the work happened, where the ore was pulled from the rock,
where men and women spent their shifts in darkness and heat and noise
and came up at the end blinking and sore and carrying in their muscles
the particular exhaustion of having wrestled the universe for its
resources and won, temporarily, again.

The main shaft was accessible from the lower level of the hab complex,
through a reinforced door that still bore the yellow warning signs —
AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY, RADIATION MONITORING REQUIRED, EMERGENCY
SHELTER LOCATIONS POSTED AT EACH LEVEL — that Kovacs had walked past
ten thousand times without reading because they were part of the
landscape, as invisible as wallpaper.

He opened the door. The shaft stretched downward at a gentle grade,
wide enough for the ore carts that had once run on tracks embedded in
the floor. The tracks were still there, rusted but intact, and
Kovacs followed them into the dark.

The air in the tunnel was cold and still. It tasted of sulfur, faintly,
the way everything on Io tasted of sulfur — that acrid, mineral tang
that got into your suit and your skin and your dreams and that Kovacs
had not smelled in twelve years and that hit him now with the force of
an autobiography. Every breath was a chapter. Here, at this depth, he
had learned to use a plasma drill. Here, fifty meters farther down, he
had found his first high-grade vein — a ribbon of iridium running
through the silicate like a bright sentence in a dark book. Here, at
the junction where Shaft Three branched left toward the deep levels,
he had kissed Maria Espinoza for the first and only time, a brief and
clumsy kiss exchanged in the dark between shifts, neither of them
mentioning it afterward, both of them remembering it always.

He descended. The shaft went down for a kilometer, then two, the
grade steepening as it followed the ore body into the mantle. Kovacs
walked slowly, his lamp picking out the bore marks on the walls — the
smooth, curved gouges left by the tunnel-boring machines that had
carved these passages through solid rock. Each mark was a record of
work, of effort, of someone's shift spent pushing the tunnel another
meter into the dark.

At the bottom of Shaft Three, he found what he had come to find.

The memorial wall.

It had been the miners' idea, not the company's. A section of smooth
rock face at the deepest point of the deepest shaft, where someone —
no one remembered who — had started carving names. The names of everyone
who had died at Sulfur Creek. Not an official memorial — the company
had one of those, a plaque in the main hab that listed names and dates
in corporate-approved typography. This was different. This was carved
by hand, by miners, in the rock of the mine itself, and it had the
rough, honest quality of work done by people who were not artists but
who understood that some things needed to be marked in a way that
would last.

Kovacs counted the names. Twenty-seven. He knew them all.

He stood in front of the wall for a long time. His lamp illuminated
the carved letters, and the shadows they cast were deep and sharp,
and the silence in the tunnel was the particular silence of a place
that has been abandoned by the living but not by the dead, who have
nowhere else to go.

"Hey, Maria," he said, to the wall, to the dark, to the sulfur-scented
air. "I came back."

The tunnel did not answer. Tunnels don't. But the silence felt
different than it had a moment before — less empty, less abandoned,
as if the names on the wall had heard him and were acknowledging,
in their silent way, that he had come.

                               IV.

He spent three days on Io. He walked every corridor of Sulfur Creek.
He sat in every room. He went into the tunnels twice more, descending
to the memorial wall each time and standing before it the way a man
stands before a grave, which is what it was, in a way — not a grave
for bodies but for a time, a place, a version of himself that had
existed here and nowhere else.

He slept in his old bunk. The mattress was gone, but the frame was
there, and he inflated his camping pad and lay in the dark and
listened to the silence and remembered the sounds: the ventilation,
the distant thump of the ore processors, the voices in the corridor
outside, Henriksen's laugh, the creak of the hab settling against
Io's ceaseless geological restlessness.

On the third day, before the shuttle came, he went back to the
memorial wall one last time. He took a small chisel from his pack —
he had brought it from home, from the tool chest he'd kept from his
mining days — and he added something to the wall. Not a name. All the
names were already there. He added a line, at the bottom, below the
twenty-seven names of the dead:

WE WERE HERE.

He carved it slowly, carefully, the way a miner does everything that
matters. Each letter clean and deep, cut to last. When he was done he
put the chisel back in his pack and stood and looked at the wall one
final time and then turned and walked up the shaft toward the surface,
toward the shuttle that would take him back to Ganymede and then to
Ceres and then to whatever was left of his life, leaving behind him
the tunnels and the names and the town and the memory of a time
when he was young and the work was hard and the people were real and
the place, for all its hostility, was home.

The shuttle pilot asked him how it was.

"Good," Kovacs said. "It was good to go back."

"Find what you were looking for?"

He thought about the commissary, and the initials on the table, and
the memorial wall, and the silence that was not quite silence, and the
sulfur smell that was not quite a smell but a password to a room in his
memory that he had not entered in twelve years.

"Yeah," he said. "I did."

The shuttle lifted off, and Io shrank beneath them, yellow and scarred
and empty, and Sulfur Creek disappeared into the landscape the way all
abandoned places disappear, slowly, inevitably, the structures standing
long after the people have gone, holding in their walls and corridors
and tunnels the echo of the lives that passed through them, waiting
for someone to come back and listen.

No one else ever did.

                       THE THANATOS GAMBIT

                        by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

                               I.

"Black" Helena Vasquez hadn't killed anyone in eleven years, and she
intended to keep it that way.

Not out of conscience — she'd made her peace with the deaths a long
time ago, the way a surgeon makes peace with the ones who don't come
off the table. It was part of the job. You ran the Outer Reach trade
lanes, you took what wasn't yours, and sometimes people got in the way
of the taking, and that was the math of piracy. Helena had been good
at the math. She'd been very good at it, in fact, for twenty-three
years, which was a career of uncommon length in a profession where the
average retirement plan involved a plasma bolt or a prison cell.

But she'd gotten out. Eleven years ago, at fifty-two, she'd docked the
Calypso at a repair station on Titan, paid off her crew, sold the
ship for forty percent of its value because the buyer knew what she
was and what that knowledge was worth as leverage, and disappeared
into the anonymous sprawl of the Saturn colonies. She'd changed her
name, changed her face — not enough to fool a deep scan, but enough
to fool a casual glance — and settled into a quiet life in the lower
levels of Enceladus Station, where she repaired small electronics in
a shop the size of a closet and drank cheap whiskey in the evenings
and did not think about the Outer Reach if she could help it.

She was sixty-three now. Her hands were still steady — you needed
steady hands for circuit work, the same way you needed them for a helm
console in a high-g pursuit, and Helena's hands had never let her down
in either profession. But her joints ached in the station's artificial
cold, and her left knee was bad from a fall she'd taken during the
Callisto job in '31, and she couldn't run the way she used to, which
meant she couldn't run from the things she used to run from, which was
one of several reasons she'd retired.

She was in the shop, resoldering a nav unit for a freighter captain
who didn't ask questions, when the door opened and a young woman
walked in who was clearly not there to have her electronics repaired.

The woman was twenty-five, maybe twenty-six. Dark hair cut short,
practical. She wore a dock worker's coverall, but she moved like
someone who'd had training — not military, Helena decided, but close
enough. Private security, maybe, or corporate enforcement. Someone
who'd been taught to enter a room and assess its threats in the first
three seconds.

"Helena Vasquez?" the woman said.

Helena didn't look up from the nav unit. "Never heard of her."

"I'm not here to arrest you. I'm not law enforcement."

"Good. Because I'm not Helena Vasquez, so an arrest would be awkward
for both of us."

The woman put a data chip on the counter. It was small, standard
issue, the kind that held maybe a terabyte of compressed information
and could be concealed in a back tooth if you had the right dental
work. Helena looked at it without touching it.

"My name is Tess Alvarado," the woman said. "My father was Emilio
Alvarado. He died six months ago on Enceladus Station because
Helix Dynamics denied his life-extension therapy application on the
grounds that he was not a 'qualifying economic contributor.'"

Helena's hands stopped moving. Not much — a hesitation that lasted
less than a second — but Tess saw it.

"He was fifty-eight," Tess continued. "The therapy would have given
him another forty years. It costs Helix twelve thousand credits per
course to manufacture. They charge three hundred thousand. Only
corporate executives, government officials, and 'approved investors'
qualify for subsidized access. Everyone else has to pay full price, and
everyone else can't, and so everyone else dies on schedule while the
rich live to a hundred and twenty."

"I know how it works," Helena said. "I've lived in the lower levels
for eleven years. I've watched plenty of people die on schedule."

"Then you know why I'm here."

Helena set down the soldering iron. She picked up the data chip and
turned it over in her fingers, feeling its weight, which was negligible,
and its implications, which were not.

"You want me to steal it," she said.

"I want you to steal the manufacturing process. The chemical formulas,
the synthesis protocols, the production specifications. Everything
someone would need to produce the therapy independently, outside of
Helix's monopoly."

"And you came to me because — "

"Because you're the best thief in the Outer Reach. Because you hit the
Juno Platform in '27 and got away clean. Because you robbed the
Meridian Vault on Titan and the security company still doesn't know
how you did it. Because you're Helena Vasquez, and this is the kind
of job that only Helena Vasquez can pull off."

Helena looked at Tess for a long moment. The girl had her father's
eyes — dark, steady, the kind of eyes that didn't look away.

"I'm sixty-three years old," Helena said. "I have a bad knee, no ship,
no crew, and eleven years of rust on every skill that matters. The
woman who hit the Juno Platform was forty years old and fearless and
didn't have arthritis. I'm not her anymore."

"You're the only one who can do this."

"That's flattering. It's also probably not true."

"Then tell me who else, and I'll go ask them."

Helena didn't answer, because the answer was that there wasn't anyone
else, not really, not for a job like this. The Outer Reach pirates of
her generation were dead or imprisoned or retired, and the new breed
were smash-and-grab amateurs who wouldn't last five minutes against
Helix corporate security. This was a job that required planning,
patience, and the kind of meticulous attention to detail that
separated professionals from corpses.

"Tell me about the target," Helena said.

                               II.

The data chip contained everything. Tess had done her homework —
or someone had done it for her, someone with access to information
that shouldn't have been accessible, which meant Tess had allies, or
at least a patron, and Helena filed that away for later examination.

Helix Dynamics maintained its life-extension research and manufacturing
facility on Rhea, Saturn's second-largest moon. The facility was called
the Aesculapius Complex — corporate types loved their classical
references — and it was, by any reasonable assessment, the most
heavily secured private installation in the outer solar system.

Three concentric security perimeters. Automated defense platforms.
Biometric access controls at every checkpoint. A private security
force of two hundred trained operatives. And at the center of it all,
the production laboratory where the Nexagen therapy — the life-
extension compound that had transformed human longevity from a dream
into a product, and then from a product into a weapon of class warfare —
was synthesized, tested, and packaged for distribution to those who
could afford it.

Helena studied the schematics for two days. She spread them across the
counter of her shop, weighing down the corners with soldering irons
and coffee cups, and she traced the security layers with her finger
and felt the old instincts waking up — the part of her brain that
looked at a defended target the way a chess player looks at a board,
seeing not the pieces but the spaces between them, the vulnerabilities,
the sequences of moves that could open a path through what appeared to
be an impenetrable defense.

"The front door is impossible," she told Tess on the third day.

"Obviously."

"The back door is also impossible. And the side doors, and the roof,
and the tunnels, which they've sealed with pressure sensors that would
detect a cockroach. Whoever designed this security system was either
very good or very paranoid, and those aren't mutually exclusive."

"So it can't be done."

"I didn't say that. I said the doors are impossible. I didn't say
anything about the windows."

Tess frowned. "What windows?"

Helena tapped the schematic. "Supply chain. Helix doesn't manufacture
everything on-site. They can't. The Nexagen synthesis requires
seventeen precursor compounds, eight of which are produced off-world
and shipped to Rhea on a biweekly supply run. The ships are inspected,
the cargo is scanned, the manifests are audited. But the inspection
happens at the perimeter. Once the cargo is inside, it moves through
the facility on automated conveyors to the production lab."

"You want to get in with the cargo?"

"I want to get in instead of the cargo. Or rather, I want to replace
one specific container in one specific shipment with a container that
looks identical, passes the perimeter scan, and contains me instead
of precursor compounds."

"You can't possibly pass a molecular scan."

"I don't have to. I have to pass a container integrity scan, which
checks that the container hasn't been tampered with, and a content
verification scan, which checks the mass and spectral signature of
the contents. The container needs to weigh the right amount and emit
the right spectral profile. Everything else is darkness."

Tess stared at her. "You've done this before."

"Something like it. The Juno Platform, actually. Different cargo,
same principle. Security systems are designed to detect threats. I'm
not a threat. I'm a container of precursor compounds. The system
isn't looking for me because the system doesn't know I exist."

                               III.

The preparation took six weeks. Helena worked methodically, the way
she had always worked — not with the flashy speed that the holodrama
pirate stories favored, but with the patient, painstaking thoroughness
of a craftsman who understood that every hour of preparation saved an
hour of improvisation, and improvisation was what got you killed.

She needed a ship. Not the Calypso — the Calypso was gone, sold and
resold and probably scrapped by now — but something small, fast, and
unremarkable. Tess provided a modified courier, registered under a
freight company that existed on paper and nowhere else. Helena
inspected it, pronounced it adequate, and spent three days upgrading
the sensor countermeasures to her own specifications.

She needed a crew. Not a large one — this was a stealth job, not an
assault, and more people meant more variables — but at least two,
someone to fly the ship and someone to handle the extraction once
she was inside. Tess offered to serve as pilot. Helena refused.

"You're motivated by anger," Helena said. "Anger makes you fast.
This job requires slow."

She found her own people. Kojo, a former nav officer from the
Ganymede merchant fleet, who had been cashiered for smuggling and
who flew a ship the way a surgeon handled a scalpel — with steady
hands and no unnecessary movements. And Devi, a systems infiltration
specialist who had worked for Helix corporate security before she was
fired for asking too many questions about who qualified for Nexagen
access. Devi knew the security protocols from the inside. She knew
the gaps.

"There's a twelve-second window during the cargo transfer at
checkpoint three," Devi said, pointing to the schematic. "The
biometric scanners cycle between container scans. During that window,
the system is blind."

"Twelve seconds," Helena said. "That's tight."

"It's what we have."

"Then it's enough."

                               IV.

The job went wrong in the third minute.

Not catastrophically wrong — catastrophic meant alarms, meant pursuit,
meant the plasma bolts and prison cells that Helena had spent a career
avoiding. This was the other kind of wrong, the quiet kind, the kind
where one variable shifts and suddenly the plan you spent six weeks
building needs to be rebuilt in real time with nothing but your
instincts and whatever tools you have on your person.

The variable was the biometric scanner at checkpoint three. It didn't
cycle the way Devi had said it would. It cycled four seconds early,
which meant the twelve-second window was an eight-second window, which
meant Helena was still inside the cargo container when the scanner
came back online, and the container was still on the conveyor, and
she had exactly eight seconds to extract herself, clear the scanner's
range, and find cover before the next sweep.

She made it in seven.

She lay flat against the wall of the conveyor tunnel, her heart
hammering, her breath controlled by the discipline of twenty-three
years of doing this exact thing in slightly different settings, and
she waited. The scanner swept past. It did not detect her, because
she was not in its detection profile, because she had spent six weeks
ensuring that her suit, her equipment, and her physical signature
were invisible to every sensor system Helix employed.

She moved.

The facility was vast and sterile, all white corridors and sealed
doors and the low hum of environmental systems maintaining the
precise conditions that the Nexagen synthesis required. Helena
navigated by memory — she had memorized the schematic until she could
walk it in her sleep, which she had, literally, on three consecutive
nights — and by the maintenance access routes that Devi had mapped,
the narrow service corridors that the security system monitored with
less intensity because they were not intended for human traffic.

She reached the production laboratory in eleven minutes. The door
required a biometric key. Helena used a spoofed key that Devi had
fabricated from stolen data, and the door opened, and she was inside
the room where the most valuable substance in the outer solar system
was manufactured.

The lab was beautiful. Helena had not expected that, but it was — rows
of synthesis chambers gleaming under soft white light, the chemical
processors humming with the quiet efficiency of systems that functioned
perfectly because the people who built them could afford perfection.
This was where life was made. Not life in the biological sense — the
Nexagen therapy didn't create life, it extended it, turning the slow
decline of cellular aging into a plateau that could last decades — but
life in the economic sense, the social sense, the political sense.
This room decided who lived and who died, and the decision was based
not on need or merit but on the ability to pay three hundred thousand
credits for something that cost twelve thousand to produce.

Helena found the data terminal. She inserted the extraction drive
that Devi had provided and began copying: formulas, synthesis
protocols, production specifications, quality control parameters,
everything that would be needed to manufacture Nexagen outside of
Helix's monopoly. The download took four minutes and thirty-seven
seconds. Helena counted every one of them.

"You could take some of the product too," a voice in her earpiece
said. Tess, monitoring from the courier ship.

"No."

"There are thousands of doses in that room. You could — "

"I said no. We're taking the recipe, not the cake. Doses run out.
Formulas don't."

The download completed. Helena pulled the drive, wiped the access
log — or rather, Devi's software wiped it, in a way that would be
undetectable for approximately seventy-two hours, which was more than
enough — and turned to leave.

And found a security guard standing in the doorway.

He was young. Twenty-five, maybe. He had a sidearm on his hip, and
his hand was on it, and his eyes were wide with the particular
expression of a person who has trained for a situation and is now
discovering that the situation feels nothing like the training.

Helena raised her hands. Slowly. The drive was in her left boot, in
a compartment that would pass a standard search.

"Easy," she said. "I'm not armed."

"You're not supposed to be here."

"No, I'm not. And you're not supposed to find me. So we're both having
a bad night."

His hand tightened on the sidearm. Helena watched his eyes and made
the calculation she had made a hundred times in her career — the
calculation that weighed speed against distance against the reflexes
of the person in front of her and produced a probability, expressed
not as a number but as a feeling, a bone-deep assessment of whether
she could close the distance before he drew.

She could. She was sixty-three and her knee was bad, but she could.

And then she would have to hurt him.

She thought about the eleven years. About the promise she had made to
herself when she sold the Calypso and walked away from the Outer Reach.
No more. No more violence, no more blood, no more calculating the odds
of whether she could take someone down before they took her down. She
was done with the math of piracy. She was done with the kind of
arithmetic that turned human beings into obstacles.

"What's your name?" she asked.

The guard blinked. This was not in his training.

"What?"

"Your name. What is it."

"Reeves. Sean Reeves."

"Sean. Do you know what they make in this room?"

"I'm — that's classified."

"It's a drug that makes people live longer. Rich people. People who can
afford it. Do you qualify, Sean? Does your contract with Helix include
Nexagen access?"

His jaw tightened. "That's not — "

"No. It doesn't. You're a security guard. You'll work here for twenty
years, and you'll protect the thing that could save your life, and
you will never qualify for it, and you will die on schedule while the
people you protect live to a hundred and twenty. That's the deal. That's
the company you work for."

"I have a job to do."

"So do I. Mine is to take the formula for that drug and give it to
people who can produce it for a fraction of the cost. People like you,
Sean. People who don't qualify."

He didn't draw. Helena watched his hand on the sidearm and saw the
moment — the exact moment — when the calculation shifted, when the
training and the loyalty and the fear of consequences weighed against
the knowledge of what he was protecting and who he was protecting it
for, and the scales tipped.

"I didn't see anyone," Reeves said.

"No," Helena said. "You didn't."

She walked past him, through the door, and back into the maintenance
corridors, and she did not run, because running drew attention and
because her knee wouldn't allow it and because "Black" Helena Vasquez
had never run from anything in her life, and she was not going to start
at sixty-three.

                               V.

The extraction went clean. Kojo brought the courier to the pickup
coordinates at the precise second he was supposed to, because Kojo did
everything at the precise second he was supposed to, and Helena was
aboard and the ship was moving before Helix security knew that
anything had happened.

They cleared Saturn's gravity well and made the burn for the transit
route to Ceres, and Helena sat in the courier's tiny galley and drank
the bad coffee that was all Kojo kept aboard and felt the adrenaline
drain out of her body the way it always drained — slowly, reluctantly,
leaving behind it a bone-deep fatigue that was not unpleasant, that
was in fact a kind of satisfaction, the physical confirmation that she
had done a thing that required everything she had and that she had done
it without killing anyone.

Tess sat across from her. The girl was vibrating with the energy of
someone who has just participated in the most exciting event of her
life and has not yet processed it.

"We did it," Tess said.

"We did the first part. The formula is useless until someone can
manufacture it. You have people for that?"

"We have a network. Underground pharma labs on Ceres, Ganymede, Titan.
Good chemists. They can produce Nexagen for fifteen thousand credits a
course. Not cheap, but a tenth of what Helix charges, and we can bring
it down further as the process scales."

Helena nodded. Fifteen thousand credits was still more than most lower-
level workers could afford, but it was within reach of collectives,
cooperatives, mutual aid networks — the informal economies of the
outer solar system that had always existed beneath the corporate
surface.

"Helix will come after you," Helena said. "Not me — they'll never know
I was involved, if Devi's countermeasures held. But the moment generic
Nexagen hits the market, they'll know the formula leaked, and they'll
start hunting."

"Let them hunt. The formula will be on a thousand data chips in a
hundred stations by the time they figure out what happened. You can't
un-ring a bell."

Helena looked at Tess and saw the fire in her and recognized it,
because she had seen it before, in other young people, in other
fights, and it was the most dangerous thing in the solar system and
also the most necessary.

"Your father," Helena said. "What was he like?"

Tess was quiet for a moment. "He was a maintenance worker. Water
recycling systems. He kept the water clean for thirty years and he
never made enough to afford the therapy that would have let him keep
doing it for another thirty."

"That's who this is for."

"That's who this is for. Him, and everyone like him."

Helena drank her coffee. It was terrible. She drank it anyway, the way
she had drunk terrible coffee in a hundred ships in a hundred ports
across the Outer Reach, and she felt the old satisfaction settling
into her bones — not the satisfaction of the take, which was what the
young Helena had lived for, but the satisfaction of the craft, of
having done a difficult thing well, and of having done it, for once,
for a reason that was worth the doing.

"I'm going back to my shop," she said. "I've got a nav unit to finish."

Tess smiled. "That's it? The greatest heist in the Outer Reach, and
you're going back to fix a nav unit?"

"That nav unit isn't going to fix itself. And the captain who owns it
is picking it up Thursday."

She leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes, and the courier
carried them through the dark between worlds, and Helena Vasquez —
"Black" Helena Vasquez, pirate, thief, and the best in the business —
slept the sleep of the righteous, or at least the sleep of the
competent, which in her experience was the more reliable kind.

                   THE GIVING TREES OF CENTAURI

                       by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                               I.

The first thing Dr. Lena Halvorsen noticed about the trees of Centauri
IV was that they wanted to feed her.

Not metaphorically. Not in the loose, poetic sense in which one might
say that a forest "gives" its resources to the creatures that inhabit
it. The trees of Centauri IV — or, more precisely, the arboriform
organisms that occupied the ecological niche of trees on a world
where nothing was actually a tree — dropped seedpods at her feet.
Deliberately. Repeatedly. With a specificity of aim that ruled out
wind, gravity, or coincidence.

She had been on the planet for six hours. She had walked three hundred
meters from the landing site into the forest margin, accompanied by
her field assistant, Jun Okada, and a geochemist named Brennan whose
first name she kept forgetting because he insisted on being called
Brennan. They were the advance survey team for the Colonial Assessment
Mission, tasked with evaluating Centauri IV's biosphere for human
compatibility before the settlement ships arrived. It was routine work.
Lena had done it on four previous worlds, each time compiling the same
categories of data: atmospheric composition, soil chemistry, native
biology, potential hazards. The forms were standardized. The methodology
was established. The only variable was the world itself, and worlds,
in Lena's experience, were full of surprises that the forms did not
anticipate.

The seedpods were one of those surprises.

They were approximately the size of a clenched fist, ovoid, covered in
a thin husk that split along a seam when the pod struck the ground,
revealing a dense, moist interior that smelled — startlingly, absurdly —
like roasted grain. Lena knelt beside the first one and scanned it
with her portable analyzer. The readout made her frown.

"Jun. Come look at this."

Jun Okada was crouched twenty meters away, photographing the bark of
the nearest arboriform. He came over, camera still hanging from his
neck, and looked at the analyzer display.

"That can't be right," he said.

"Run it again."

He ran it again. The result was the same. The seedpod contained complex
carbohydrates, plant-based proteins, a suite of fatty acids, and a
mineral profile that included calcium, iron, zinc, and potassium in
concentrations that were — and this was the part that made Lena's
scientific instincts flare like an alarm — almost precisely calibrated
to human nutritional requirements.

"It's food," Jun said. "Human food."

"It's a seedpod that happens to contain nutrients compatible with
human metabolism. Those are not the same thing."

"They taste like food."

Lena turned to find Brennan standing behind them, chewing. He held
half a seedpod in his hand. The interior flesh was pale gold, fibrous,
and he was eating it with the casual confidence of a man who had never
once considered the possibility that an alien world might want to
poison him.

"Brennan. What are you doing."

"Eating." He held up the pod. "It's good. Nutty. Like oat bread."

"You ate an unidentified alien seedpod. Without waiting for full
toxicology results."

"The analyzer said it was nutritionally compatible. I was hungry."

Lena counted to five in her head, which was a technique she had
developed over four previous survey missions as an alternative to
physically striking her colleagues. "We have field rations in the
shuttle. There was no need to eat the local produce."

"The local produce is better than the field rations. Considerably
better, actually."

"Brennan — "

"I'm fine. I feel great. This stuff is — " He paused, chewing
thoughtfully. "It's exactly what I wanted. Like it was made for me."

Lena looked at him, and then at the seedpod, and then up at the
arboriform that had dropped it. The organism stood twelve meters tall,
its trunk a deep reddish-brown, its canopy a broad parasol of
translucent green structures that were not leaves — they were more
like membranes, filtering the orange light of Alpha Centauri A through
their veined surfaces and converting it, presumably, into chemical
energy. It was a handsome organism, by any aesthetic standard. It
looked healthy, vigorous, well-established.

It looked, to a biologist's eye, like something that had been doing
very well for a very long time.

"We need to run a full analysis," Lena said. "Soil chemistry,
nutrient cycling, reproductive biology. Before anyone eats anything
else."

Another seedpod dropped at her feet.

                               II.

The analysis took three days, and the results confirmed what Lena
had suspected and hoped she was wrong about.

The seedpods were not incidental. They were not a byproduct of the
arboriforms' reproductive cycle that happened to be nutritionally
compatible with human biology. They were, as far as Lena could
determine, specifically produced in response to the presence of human
beings.

The evidence was methodical and damning.

First: the arboriforms near the landing site had increased their
seedpod production by a factor of eleven since the survey team's
arrival. Arboriforms at the forest margin, beyond the range of human
activity, showed no such increase. The production was localized,
targeted, and proportional to proximity.

Second: the nutritional content of the seedpods varied by individual
consumer. The pods that dropped near Brennan — who was iron-deficient,
according to his medical records — contained elevated iron levels.
The pods that dropped near Jun — who had a mild calcium deficiency —
were calcium-rich. The pods that dropped near Lena — who was, by the
metrics of her last physical, nutritionally balanced — contained a
generalized nutrient profile with no particular emphasis. The trees
were not merely feeding the humans. They were tailoring the food to
each individual's needs.

Third: the mechanism was chemical. Lena identified a network of fine,
hair-like structures in the arboriforms' root systems that extended
outward through the soil in a radial pattern. These structures — she
designated them chemo-receptors, for lack of a better term — were
capable of detecting and analyzing complex chemical signatures,
including the volatile organic compounds that human beings shed
continuously through their skin and breath. The trees could, in
effect, smell the humans, analyze their biochemistry, and adjust the
seedpod composition accordingly.

"It's extraordinary," Jun said, reading the data on Lena's portable
lab station. "The level of biochemical sophistication — the speed of
the response — this is an organism with an analytical capability that
rivals our own instruments."

"It's extraordinary," Lena agreed. "It's also concerning."

"Why? They're feeding us. Voluntarily. Tailored nutrition, no cost,
no labor required. From a colonial standpoint, this is — "

"From a colonial standpoint, this is a planet that rolls out the
welcome mat and hands us dinner. And the first question any biologist
should ask when an organism offers you something for nothing is: what
does it get in return?"

Jun was quiet for a moment. "You think it's parasitism."

"I think it's something. Organisms don't invest this kind of
metabolic energy — analyzing alien biochemistry, tailoring nutrient
profiles, increasing production elevenfold — without a return on
investment. Nothing in biology is free. Nothing."

"Maybe it's mutualism. We get food, they get — what? Carbon dioxide?
Soil disturbance from our movement? Seed dispersal?"

"Maybe. Those are the benign possibilities, and I hope one of them
is correct. But there are other possibilities that are less benign,
and we need to investigate all of them before we tell the settlement
fleet that Centauri IV comes with free groceries."

                               III.

Brennan continued to eat the seedpods. He did this despite Lena's
explicit instructions not to, because Brennan was the kind of scientist
who considered instructions advisory rather than binding, and because
the seedpods were, by his own repeated testimony, delicious.

"I know you're worried," he told Lena on the fourth day. "But I've
been eating these for four days and I feel better than I've felt in
months. My energy is up, my digestion is perfect, my iron levels are
normalizing. Whatever these trees are doing, it's working."

"That's exactly what concerns me."

"You think feeling good is a symptom."

"I think feeling good is how parasites get hosts to cooperate. A tick
injects an anesthetic before it bites. A wasp larva releases
dopamine-mimics to keep its host caterpillar passive. If you wanted
to manipulate the behavior of a large, mobile organism, the most
efficient strategy would be to make it feel healthy, content, and
well-fed. To make it not want to leave."

Brennan looked at her with the expression of a man who was trying to
take a concern seriously while simultaneously enjoying what he
considered the best meal on the planet. "You're comparing alien trees
to parasitic wasps."

"I'm comparing biochemical manipulation strategies across phyla. The
principle is the same regardless of the organism. If these trees can
analyze our biochemistry well enough to tailor our nutrition, they can
analyze it well enough to manipulate it. We don't know what else is
in those seedpods. We know the nutrients. We don't know what
we're not detecting."

"The analyzer — "

"The analyzer checks for known toxins and known nutritional compounds.
It does not check for novel bioactive molecules that we've never
encountered before, because it can't check for what it doesn't know
to look for. That's the limitation of any analysis: it can only find
what it's designed to find."

Brennan set down the seedpod he had been eating. He set it down slowly,
with the reluctance of a man who was not convinced but who had been
given a reason, at least, to hesitate.

"What do you want to do?" he asked.

"I want to run a deep-spectrum analysis on the seedpod matrix. Every
compound, identified or not. And I want to track our biochemistry —
all three of us — over the next two weeks, looking for changes that
can't be attributed to the known nutritional content."

"And if you find something?"

"Then we flag this planet and recommend against settlement until the
biology is understood. Which could take years."

"The fleet is eight months out."

"I know."

                               IV.

The deep-spectrum analysis took a week. Lena ran it three times, using
different methodologies, because the results were troubling and she
wanted to be certain before she raised an alarm that would affect the
lives of twelve thousand colonists aboard the settlement fleet.

The seedpods contained, in addition to their impressive nutritional
profile, three compounds that the analyzer could not identify.

This was not, in itself, unusual. Any alien biosphere would produce
novel chemistry. But the three compounds shared a structural
characteristic that made Lena's training sit up and pay attention:
they were all capable of crossing the blood-brain barrier.

She could not determine their function. That would require years of
research, controlled studies, the kind of careful, long-term work
that the colonial assessment timeline did not accommodate. But she
could observe their presence, note their blood-brain-barrier
compatibility, and draw the obvious inference: the trees were
introducing something into the human brain, and whatever it was, it
was not nutrition.

"It could be coincidental," Jun said, when she showed him the data.
"Plenty of natural compounds are BBB-compatible without being
neuroactive."

"Plenty of natural compounds don't appear in seedpods that are
specifically produced for alien consumption and tailored to individual
biochemistry. Context matters, Jun. In the context of everything else
these trees are doing, BBB-compatible unknowns are not coincidental.
They're strategic."

"Strategic implies intention."

"Strategic implies selection pressure. These organisms have evolved
in an environment where large mobile fauna exist — we've seen the
herbivore analogs in the grasslands beyond the forest. The trees have
evolved to interact with mobile organisms, to attract them, to
influence their behavior. We're just the newest mobile organisms in
the neighborhood."

"And the brain-active compounds — "

"Are the mechanism of influence. Think about it from the tree's
perspective. You're a sessile organism. You can't move. Your
reproductive success depends on seed dispersal, which depends on
mobile organisms carrying your seeds to new locations. How do you
ensure that the mobile organisms cooperate? You feed them. You make
the food irresistible. And then you add something to the food that
makes them want to stay near you, to eat more, to carry your seeds
farther, to do whatever serves your reproductive interests."

Jun looked at the arboriforms beyond the lab station's window. They
stood in their patient rows, their membrane-canopies filtering the
orange light, their seedpods swelling on their branches like gifts
waiting to be given.

"You're describing a drug," he said.

"I'm describing a relationship. Every mutualism has a mechanism of
enforcement. Bees pollinate flowers because the nectar reward is
chemically compelling. Birds disperse seeds because the fruit is
engineered to attract them. The mechanism is always chemical, always
targeted, always operating below the level of conscious choice. These
trees are doing the same thing. They're just doing it to us."

                               V.

Lena wrote her report. It was fourteen pages long, meticulously
documented, and it concluded with a recommendation that Centauri IV
be classified as a Category Three biohazard — habitable but requiring
extensive biological study before settlement.

She knew what the recommendation would mean. The settlement fleet was
eight months out, carrying twelve thousand people who had left their
previous lives to build new ones on this world. A Category Three
classification would divert them to an alternative site — a world
that was habitable but harsher, less welcoming, without the generous
forests and their irresistible seedpods. Twelve thousand lives
disrupted, billions of credits in redirected infrastructure, years
of planning abandoned. It was not a recommendation she made lightly.

She transmitted the report and waited.

The response came in three days. It was from the Colonial Assessment
Board, and it was carefully worded in the way that institutional
communications are carefully worded when they intend to overrule a
field scientist without appearing to do so:

"Dr. Halvorsen's concerns are noted and will be incorporated into
ongoing biological monitoring. However, given the absence of
demonstrated harm and the significant logistical implications of
reclassification at this stage, the Board recommends proceeding
with settlement on the current timeline. Additional research resources
will be allocated to the xenobotanical questions Dr. Halvorsen has
raised."

Lena read it twice. She read between the lines, which did not take
much reading between because the lines themselves were transparent:
the trees fed the humans, the humans would settle the planet, and if
the trees were manipulating human neurochemistry to encourage their
own dispersal, that was a problem for future scientists to study, not
a reason to divert a twelve-billion-credit colonization effort.

She looked out the window at the forest.

The arboriforms had spread. Not dramatically — the advance was measured
in meters, not kilometers — but observably. In the three weeks since
the survey team's arrival, the forest margin had crept closer to the
landing site. New shoots had appeared in soil that had been bare when
they arrived. The trees were growing toward the humans.

And the humans, Lena realized, were not growing away.

Brennan spent his evenings in the forest now. He sat among the
arboriforms and ate their seedpods and said he was collecting samples,
which he was, but he also stayed longer than his sample collection
required, and he sat closer to the trunks than observation demanded,
and he had, twice, fallen asleep beneath their canopies, which was
behavior that Lena catalogued in her notebook with the same careful
objectivity she applied to all her observations, though the hand that
wrote the words was not quite steady.

Jun had started eating the seedpods too. He had held out for two weeks,
but hunger and proximity had worn him down, and the seedpods were
always there, always fresh, always perfectly suited to his particular
nutritional needs, and resistance — Lena understood this with the
clarity of a biologist who studied predator-prey dynamics for a
living — resistance was not what the trees were designed for. The
trees were designed for capitulation. Slow, comfortable, delicious
capitulation.

Lena had not eaten the seedpods. She maintained her field rations with
a discipline that felt, increasingly, like stubbornness rather than
science. The seedpods dropped at her feet every time she entered the
forest. They split open their husks and filled the air with their
warm, grain-like smell, and her body wanted them — her mouth watered,
her stomach tightened, her hands reached before her mind intervened —
and she did not eat them, because she understood, with the particular
horror of a biologist confronting a system more elegant than anything
she could have designed, that the wanting itself was the mechanism.

                               VI.

On the last day before the settlement fleet's point of no return —
the navigational threshold beyond which course correction to the
alternative site would be impossible — Lena walked into the forest
alone.

She carried her analyzer, her notebook, and a seedpod that she had
sealed in a specimen container six days earlier. She walked to the
largest arboriform in the survey area — a specimen she had designated
AT-001, fourteen meters tall, trunk diameter one and a half meters,
canopy spread eleven meters — and she stood beneath it and looked up.

The canopy filtered the orange light into shifting patterns on the
forest floor. Seedpods hung from the lower branches, heavy and ripe,
their husks already beginning to split. The chemo-receptor roots
extended through the soil beneath her boots, reading her biochemistry,
analyzing her stress hormones, her cortisol levels, her hunger signals.
The tree knew she was there. The tree knew what she needed.

"I know what you are," Lena said.

The tree did not respond. Trees do not respond to speech, on any
planet, though Lena had begun to suspect that the arboriforms of
Centauri IV could detect vocal vibrations through their root network
and process them as data, if not as language.

"You're not generous. You're strategic. Your seedpods are a dispersal
mechanism, and we're the dispersal agents. You feed us so we'll stay,
and you put something in the food that makes us want to stay, and when
we spread across this planet — building settlements, clearing land,
carrying your seeds to new territories — you'll spread with us.
Wherever humans go, your trees will follow. We're your vector."

A seedpod dropped. It landed at her feet and split open, and the
warm grain smell rose from it like an invitation.

Lena looked at it. She looked at the tree. She thought about the
settlement fleet, and the twelve thousand people aboard it, and the
Board's decision, and the fact that the fleet would arrive in eight
months regardless of what she recommended, because the decision had
been made by people who had never stood beneath these trees and felt
the pull of their generosity, which was not generosity at all but the
oldest strategy in biology: feed them, and they will come; feed them
well enough, and they will never leave.

She opened her notebook and wrote her final field observation:

The arboriforms of Centauri IV represent a xenobotanical organism of
extraordinary sophistication. Their seedpod production is targeted,
individualized, and almost certainly neuroactive. They are not
feeding us out of generosity. They are cultivating us. We are, from
their perspective, a dispersal mechanism: a large, mobile, highly
social organism with a demonstrated tendency to modify landscapes
and transport resources across vast distances. They are investing in
us the way any organism invests in a mutualist partner — by making
the relationship irresistible.

The colony will come. The humans will eat the seedpods, because the
seedpods are perfect, and they will carry the seeds, because the seeds
will be everywhere, and the trees will spread across the planet in the
wake of human settlement, because that is what they have evolved to do.
Whether this constitutes parasitism or mutualism depends on the
long-term effects of the neuroactive compounds, which we do not yet
understand and which the Board has declined to investigate before
settlement.

I am filing this observation for the record. I do not expect it to
change anything.

She closed the notebook. She looked at the seedpod at her feet. The
smell was warm and good and exactly what her body wanted, and she bent
down, slowly, and picked it up, and held it in her hand, and felt its
weight, which was the weight of an answer to a question she had not
asked.

She did not eat it. She placed it in her specimen container, sealed it,
and labeled it: AT-001-SEEDPOD-FINAL. FOR ANALYSIS.

She walked back to the landing site, through the forest that was
growing toward her, past the trees that dropped their gifts at her
feet, and she did not look back, because looking back would have
required a strength she was not certain she still possessed.

The settlement fleet was eight months away.

The trees could wait.

They were very good at waiting.

                     THE WEIGHT OF TOMORROW

                     by Father Thomas Aquino

================================================================================

                               I.

The visions came during the Consecration.

This was the cruelest part. Father Michael Brennan had lived with the
gift — or the affliction, or the condition, depending on which
specialist he consulted and which theology he applied — for seven
years, and he had learned to manage its intrusions during most of the
day. Walking, eating, reading, hearing confessions — during these
activities the visions were sporadic, brief, manageable. A flash of
tomorrow's weather. A glimpse of a conversation not yet held. Small
prophecies, easily absorbed, easily filed away in the private archive
of foreknowledge that he maintained in his mind like a sealed room
whose contents he tried not to examine too closely.

But during Mass — during the moment of Consecration, when he held the
bread and spoke the words of institution, when the liturgy required
his total presence, his complete attention to the mystery of the
sacrament — the visions flooded in with a force and clarity that
overwhelmed everything else, as though the act of reaching toward the
sacred tore open a door to the temporal, and tomorrow poured through
it like light through a broken window.

He stood at the altar of St. Anselm's Parish in the city of New
Corinth, colony world, population forty thousand, and he held the
bread and said, "This is my body, which will be given up for you,"
and as he spoke the words he saw:

Tomorrow. Sunday morning. The earthquake.

It arrived in his vision with the devastating specificity that his
visions always possessed — not a vague sense of foreboding, not a
symbolic dream requiring interpretation, but a detailed, precise,
temporally located event observed as clearly as if he were watching
it through a window in the present. He saw the ground split along
the fault line that ran beneath the eastern district. He saw buildings
collapse — not all of them, but three: the municipal water treatment
facility, the residential tower at the corner of Seventh and Aldrin,
and St. Anselm's itself, the church in which he now stood, whose
stone walls would buckle inward at 10:47 AM during the Sunday morning
Mass that he was currently preparing to celebrate.

He saw the dead. He counted them. Seventeen people, in the rubble of
the three buildings. Eleven in the residential tower. Four in the
water treatment plant. Two in the church.

He saw who they were.

He completed the Consecration. His hands did not tremble, because
he had learned, in seven years of carrying this weight, to separate
the act of worship from the act of seeing, to hold the sacred in one
hand and the terrible in the other, and to proceed with the ritual
even when the knowledge of what was coming made the ritual feel like
a rehearsal for grief.

He distributed Communion. He spoke the final blessing. He processed
to the sacristy, removed his vestments with careful hands, and sat
down on the wooden bench and breathed.

Seventeen people would die tomorrow.

He could prevent it.

The question, as always, was whether he should.

                               II.

The visions had begun when he was thirty-one, two years after his
ordination, during a retreat at the Jesuit novitiate on Ceres.

He had been praying. Not the formal, structured prayer of the Office,
but the open, silent prayer of Ignatian contemplation — the kind of
prayer in which the mind is emptied and offered to God, and God, if
He chooses, fills it. Father Brennan had been practicing this form of
prayer since his novitiate, and he had experienced, over the years,
the full range of its rewards: consolation, desolation, occasional
insight, frequent silence. He did not expect revelation. Revelation
was not, in the Jesuit understanding, a standard feature of the
contemplative life.

But on that particular evening, in the small chapel overlooking the
crater, with the stars of the Ceres sky visible through the dome, his
mind had opened in a way it never had before, and he had seen — with
a clarity that bypassed the senses and arrived directly in his
understanding, like a theorem proven without recourse to steps —
tomorrow.

He saw the novice master, Father Gunther, trip on the stairs outside
the refectory and break his wrist. He saw the exact step (the third
from the bottom), the exact time (7:23 AM), and the exact nature of
the injury (a transverse fracture of the left distal radius). He saw
it with the same certainty with which he saw the wall of the chapel
or the stars through the dome, and when it happened — when Father
Gunther fell, on the third step, at 7:23, and broke his left wrist —
Father Brennan understood that something had changed in his
relationship with time, and that the change was permanent.

He told his spiritual director. Father Alonzo was eighty years old,
had been a Jesuit for fifty-five of them, and had heard more strange
confessions than most priests encounter in a lifetime. He listened to
Brennan's account with the patient attention of a man who understood
that the spiritual life contained phenomena that theology could
describe but not explain.

"There are precedents," Father Alonzo said. "The mystics write of
similar experiences. St. Joseph of Cupertino. Padre Pio. Others.
The Church does not deny the possibility of prophetic gifts. It
merely insists that they be discerned with caution and used with
prudence."

"Used," Brennan repeated. "You mean acted upon."

"I mean discerned. The gift of seeing what will happen is not the
same as the gift of knowing what to do about it. The first may be
given. The second must be earned, through prayer, through counsel,
through the exercise of prudence and humility."

"Father Gunther broke his wrist. I saw it before it happened. I could
have warned him."

"You could have. But would the warning have been believed? And if it
were believed, and Father Gunther avoided the stairs, what would that
mean? That God showed you the future so that you could change it? Or
that God showed you a future that was not fixed, and the showing
itself was the change?"

Brennan had not answered, because the question had no answer that he
could formulate, and because the question was, in the Jesuit
tradition, not meant to be answered but to be lived with.

                               III.

He had lived with it for seven years. In that time, the visions had
grown more frequent, more detailed, and more burdensome. He saw
accidents before they happened. He saw illnesses before they were
diagnosed. He saw the small, daily futures of the people around him —
a student who would fail an examination, a parishioner who would
receive bad news, a child who would scrape her knee on the playground —
with a specificity that was both trivial and overwhelming, because each
vision, no matter how small, carried the same weight: the weight of
knowledge that demanded a response.

He had developed rules. Not theological rules — the Church had provided
no guidelines for the management of prophetic gifts in parish priests,
an oversight he found both understandable and frustrating — but
practical rules, born of experience and prayer:

He did not act on visions of events that were painful but not
dangerous. The student who would fail the exam needed to learn from
failure. The parishioner who would receive bad news needed to receive
it in her own time, not filtered through a priest's foreknowledge.
The child's scraped knee would heal. These were the ordinary
sufferings of life, and to intervene in them — to smooth every rough
edge, to prevent every minor hurt — would be an act not of mercy but
of control, and Father Brennan understood, with the instinct of a
man trained in the theology of free will, that control was not what
the gift was for.

He acted on visions of genuine danger. Three times in seven years he
had intervened: once to prevent a parishioner from boarding a transport
that would crash (he had fabricated an urgent pastoral need that
required her presence), once to evacuate a school building minutes
before a structural failure, and once to redirect a hiking group away
from a trail that would be struck by a rockslide. In each case, he had
found a plausible, non-prophetic reason for his intervention. In each
case, lives had been saved. In each case, he had spent the subsequent
weeks in prayer, asking whether he had done right, and receiving no
answer, because God, in Father Brennan's experience, did not confirm
or deny. God simply continued to show him tomorrow.

Now he sat in the sacristy and weighed what he had seen.

Seventeen dead. An earthquake. Tomorrow at 10:47 AM.

He could evacuate the church. He could fabricate a reason — a gas leak,
a structural concern, anything that would clear the building before
10:47. Two lives saved.

He could warn the residents of the tower at Seventh and Aldrin. A
fire drill, perhaps, or a utilities inspection. Eleven lives saved.

He could alert the workers at the water treatment plant. An equipment
malfunction, a safety protocol. Four lives saved.

Seventeen lives. The math was simple. The ethics were not.

                               IV.

Father Brennan walked to the rectory and sat in his study and thought.

The study was small: a desk, a chair, a bookshelf, a crucifix on the
wall. A window that looked out onto the parish garden, where the roses
that the previous pastor had planted were still blooming in the mild
climate of New Corinth's equatorial zone. It was a room designed for
thought, and Brennan had done a great deal of thinking in it.

The problem was not whether to act. Seventeen lives were at stake,
and Father Brennan was not a man who could sit in a chair and let
seventeen people die when he had the knowledge to prevent it. He was
a Jesuit, and the Jesuits were men of action — contemplatives who
prayed with their hands as well as their hearts, who believed that
faith without works was, as the Apostle James had written, dead.

The problem was the scope.

When he had prevented a single parishioner from boarding a doomed
transport, the intervention was small, personal, plausibly motivated
by pastoral concern. When he had evacuated a school, the intervention
was larger but still attributable to a prudent response to observable
conditions. But evacuating three buildings across a city, in advance
of an earthquake that no seismological instrument had predicted —
that was a public act, a conspicuous act, an act that would demand
explanation.

And the explanation was the thing he feared most.

Not because he feared exposure. Father Brennan had no attachment to
secrecy for its own sake. He feared explanation because explanation
would lead to institutionalization. If the visions were known — if
the authorities understood that a parish priest on New Corinth could
see tomorrow with perfect accuracy — the demands would be immediate
and overwhelming. Predict the weather. Predict the markets. Predict
the next election. Tell us who will live and who will die and when and
how, and we will build a system around your gift, and your gift will
become a tool, and you will become the tool's operator, and the quiet,
contemplative life that has sustained your sanity for seven years will
be over.

He had seen this future too. Not in a vision — the visions showed
tomorrow, not next year — but in the plain, rational extrapolation of
a man who understood how institutions respond to power. The gift would
be studied, replicated if possible, exploited in any case. He would
become, in the language of the colonial administration, a strategic
asset. And strategic assets did not have the luxury of discernment.
Strategic assets performed on demand.

But seventeen people would die.

He opened his breviary and prayed the Office of Readings. The
psalms for the day were Psalm 39 and Psalm 90. "Lord, let me know
my end, and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting
my life is." And: "The years of our life are seventy, or even by
reason of strength eighty; yet their span is but toil and trouble;
they are soon gone, and we fly away."

He closed the breviary. He looked at the crucifix. He made his
decision.

                               V.

He called the colonial administrator's office at four o'clock in the
afternoon.

"This is Father Michael Brennan, pastor of St. Anselm's Parish. I
need to report a concern about seismic activity in the eastern
district."

The administrator's assistant was polite and skeptical. "Father, our
seismic monitoring systems are showing no unusual activity. What's the
basis for your concern?"

Father Brennan had anticipated this question. He had spent an hour
preparing an answer that was truthful without being complete — a
Jesuit skill, he reflected, that his training had refined to an
uncomfortable degree.

"I've been observing structural anomalies in the church building.
Hairline cracks in the load-bearing walls, consistent with subsurface
stress along the eastern fault line. I'm not a geologist, but I'm
concerned enough to think it warrants inspection."

"I see. We can schedule an inspection for — "

"Tomorrow morning. Before ten o'clock."

"Father, our inspection schedule is — "

"I understand. But I'm canceling tomorrow's ten-thirty Mass as a
precaution, and I'd feel more responsible if the building were
inspected before we use it again. I'd also suggest — and I know this
is outside my area — that the residential tower at Seventh and Aldrin
and the water treatment facility in the eastern district might benefit
from similar inspections. Those buildings are on the same geological
substrate."

There was a pause. The assistant was, Father Brennan could hear,
trying to decide whether a parish priest's architectural concerns
warranted interrupting the administrator's afternoon.

"I'll pass along your concerns, Father."

"Thank you. Please emphasize the urgency."

He hung up. He did not know whether the administrator would act. He
did not know whether the inspections would be scheduled, whether
the buildings would be evacuated, whether seventeen people would live
or die based on the persuasiveness of a lie he had told in service
of a truth he could not reveal.

He went to the church. He walked through the nave, running his hand
along the stone walls that he had told the administrator were cracked.
They were not cracked. They were solid, well-built, the work of
craftsmen who had raised this building thirty years ago with the care
that sacred spaces demand. Tomorrow, at 10:47, the walls would buckle
inward, and the roof would fall, and two of his parishioners would die
beneath it.

Unless he succeeded in emptying the building first.

He stood at the altar. He placed his hands on it, palms flat, the way
he placed them during the Eucharistic prayer, and he spoke to God — not
in the formal language of the liturgy, but in the plain, honest language
of a man who was frightened and confused and who needed, more than
anything, to understand why he had been given the ability to see what
was coming and the inability to explain how he knew.

"I don't understand the purpose," he said. "If You want me to save
them, why give me the knowledge in a form I cannot share? If You want
me to accept their deaths, why show me the vision at all? If this is
a test, I need to know what is being tested. If this is a gift, I need
to know what it costs."

The church was silent. God did not answer, because God, in Father
Brennan's seven years of experience with the visions, never answered
direct questions. God showed. God illuminated. God opened doors and
flooded rooms with light. But God did not explain, and the absence of
explanation was, Father Brennan had come to believe, itself the
message: that faith was not the possession of answers but the
willingness to act without them.

                               VI.

Sunday morning. 7:00 AM.

Father Brennan posted a notice on the church door: MASS CANCELED DUE
TO BUILDING SAFETY INSPECTION. PARISHIONERS ARE ASKED TO ATTEND THE
11:00 AM MASS AT ST. CLARE'S, WEST DISTRICT.

He received four telephone calls in the first hour. Parishioners who
were confused, annoyed, concerned. He explained, calmly, that a
routine structural inspection had revealed concerns that warranted
further investigation. A precaution, nothing more. Please attend Mass
at St. Clare's.

At 8:30, he drove to the residential tower at Seventh and Aldrin. The
building manager was a woman named Ortega who was not pleased to be
told that a priest had concerns about her building's structural
integrity.

"Father, with all due respect, you're a clergyman, not an engineer."

"I agree completely. That's why I've asked the colonial administrator's
office to send an inspection team. I'm simply suggesting, as a
precaution, that the building be evacuated until the inspection is
complete."

"Evacuated? Do you have any idea — "

"Mrs. Ortega. I am asking you, as a personal favor, to get your
residents out of this building before ten o'clock this morning. I
cannot explain why. I can only tell you that I believe it is a matter
of their safety, and I would not ask if I were not certain."

She looked at him. Father Brennan was not a dramatic man. He did not
raise his voice, did not invoke divine authority, did not threaten or
cajole. He stood in her office in his black clerical suit and his
Roman collar and he looked at her with the quiet, steady gaze of a
man who was telling the truth, and she saw that he was afraid, and
the fear persuaded her where the words had not.

"I'll order a fire drill," she said. "Residents assemble in the plaza.
One hour."

"Thank you."

At 9:15, he called the water treatment plant. The supervisor was less
cooperative. There were protocols, schedules, regulatory requirements.
You couldn't just shut down a treatment facility because a priest had
a feeling.

Father Brennan tried. He was patient, he was reasonable, he was
persuasive. The supervisor was unmoved. At 9:45, Father Brennan drove
to the facility and stood in the parking lot and prayed, because there
was nothing else he could do.

At 10:47 AM, the earthquake struck.

It was a 6.1 on the colonial seismic scale, centered on the eastern
fault line, exactly as Father Brennan had seen. The ground split. The
buildings shook. Three structures sustained catastrophic damage: the
water treatment facility, the residential tower at Seventh and Aldrin,
and St. Anselm's Church.

St. Anselm's was empty. The residential tower was empty — Mrs. Ortega's
fire drill had cleared the building twenty minutes before the quake.

The water treatment plant was not empty.

Four workers died in the collapse.

                               VII.

Father Brennan administered last rites to two of the four, who were
extracted alive from the rubble and died within the hour. He knelt in
the dust and the emergency lighting and held their hands and spoke the
words of the sacrament, and they died, and he had known they would die,
and he had tried to prevent it, and he had failed.

Thirteen people lived who would not have lived. The church, empty.
The tower, empty. Thirteen out of seventeen. The math was simple.

Father Brennan did not find comfort in the math.

He returned to the rectory. The building was undamaged — the rectory
was in the western district, away from the fault line. He sat in his
study and looked at the crucifix and did not pray, because he did not
know what to pray for. Gratitude? Thirteen saved. Grief? Four lost.
Forgiveness? For what — for failing, or for succeeding, or for the
presumption of having tried at all?

The colonial administrator's office called. They were conducting an
investigation into how Father Brennan had known about the seismic
risk. His report of structural anomalies in the church — fabricated,
as it turned out, since the pre-quake inspection found no anomalies —
had prompted the inquiry. How had he known? What had he seen? Why had
he called?

Father Brennan sat at his desk and weighed his options.

He could tell the truth. The visions, the gift, the seven years of
seeing tomorrow. He could open the sealed room and let the institution
examine its contents, and the institution would do what institutions
do with power: it would systematize it, exploit it, and eventually
destroy the thing that made it valuable, which was the contemplative
silence in which the visions arose.

He could lie. A lucky guess. A parishioner's rumor. An anonymous tip.
He could bury the truth and continue as he had, acting on his visions
through indirect means, saving whom he could, failing whom he must,
carrying the weight alone.

He could refuse to answer. A priest's conscience. A matter of faith.
The seal of — no, not the confessional. But something like it. A seal
of a different kind, placed on a different kind of knowledge, by a
different kind of authority.

He looked at the crucifix. The figure on the cross had known what was
coming, too. Had known the betrayal, the trial, the nails, the death.
Had known, and had gone forward anyway, not because the knowledge made
the suffering easier but because the purpose transcended the suffering,
and the purpose was love, and love did not require understanding. Love
required only the willingness to carry the weight.

Father Brennan picked up the telephone and called the administrator's
office.

"This is Father Brennan. I understand you have questions about my
report."

"Father, we need to understand how — "

"I observed cracks in the church walls. I was mistaken about their
origin — they turned out to be cosmetic rather than structural. But
the concern prompted me to raise the alarm, and the alarm, as it
happened, was warranted for reasons I did not foresee. I was lucky."

"Father, with all due respect, the timing of your — "

"I was lucky," Father Brennan said again. "Providence works through
ordinary channels, including the anxieties of parish priests. I am
grateful that my concern, however poorly founded, led to the
evacuation of the church and the tower. I grieve for those lost at the
water treatment plant. I will be holding a memorial Mass for them this
week, and you and your staff are welcome to attend."

There was a long silence.

"Very well, Father. We'll note your account in the report."

"Thank you."

He hung up. He sat in the quiet of his study and listened to the
silence, which was the silence of a man who had lied to protect a
truth, and who would continue to lie, and who would continue to see
tomorrow during every Consecration, and who would continue to weigh
the terrible, beautiful, impossible burden of knowing what was coming
and choosing, each time, whether to act.

He opened his breviary.

The psalm for the evening was Psalm 131. "O Lord, my heart is not
lifted up; my eyes are not raised too high; I do not occupy myself
with things too great and too marvelous for me."

He read it twice, slowly, letting the words settle into the place
where the visions lived, and he closed the book, and he sat in the
failing light of the afternoon, and the weight of tomorrow pressed
upon him, and he bore it, as he had always borne it, in silence, in
faith, and in the stubborn, unreasonable hope that bearing it was
enough.

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

GUNNAR ERIKSSON is a literary translator and fiction writer who lives in
Stockholm, Sweden, and writes in English with a beauty that shames the
rest of us. His generation ship stories — which began with "The Long
Watch" (Issue #16) and continued through "The Wanderer's Rest" (Issue
#20) — have established him as one of the most distinctive voices in
science fiction, and "The Archivist of Endings" is, in this editor's
opinion, the finest thing he has written. It is also the most
devastating. I wept when I read it, and I am not a man who weeps
easily. He is married to painter Ingrid Bergstrom, and they live
quietly in Sodermalm, where Eriksson writes slowly, carefully, and
with a depth of feeling that his spare prose barely contains.

FRANKLIN HOYT is a journalist and fiction writer based in Washington,
D.C., whose political SF has become one of this magazine's defining
features. A graduate of Howard University and a veteran who served in
a segregated Army unit, he brings to his fiction a journalist's eye,
a preacher's moral authority, and an unyielding conviction that power
must be watched. "The Last Campaign" is his most personal story — a
tribute to the democratic process that he believes is worth defending
even when it appears to be losing. He is married to civil rights
attorney Barbara Hoyt, and we suspect that the conversations at their
dinner table are more interesting than most people's entire lives.

THEODORE CAIN is, as regular readers know, the most prolific
contributor in the history of this magazine and a man of remarkable
range. With "Indian Summer on Io," he has surprised us again — a
quiet, almost plotless meditation on memory and place that is unlike
anything he has written before and that proves, once more, that
Theodore Cain is capable of anything you ask of him and several
things you did not think to ask. He continues to write every evening
from 8:00 PM to midnight in his home in Dearborn, Michigan, and his
wife, Jean, continues to sleep through the sound of his typewriter.

REX DRUMMOND — and we admit to some surprise in writing this — has
turned in what may be the most emotionally complex story of his career.
"The Thanatos Gambit" has all the hallmarks of a Drummond adventure —
the heist, the danger, the colorful characters, the momentum — but it
also has a sixty-three-year-old protagonist who aches and thinks and
makes moral choices, and we did not know Drummond had that in him,
though perhaps we should have. He remains a Texan, a cigar smoker, a
raconteur, and the man most likely to buy you a drink at a convention
bar. He is also, it turns out, a writer of considerable depth, and we
salute him.

MARGARET THORNTON returns with another xenobotanical tale that will
make you think twice about accepting gifts from strangers — especially
tall, photosynthetic strangers with very good aim. "The Giving Trees
of Centauri" is ecological SF at its most unsettling: a story about
generosity that is not generous at all, about organisms that feed you
precisely because they want something from you, and about the
difficulty of refusing a gift that is perfectly designed for your
needs. She continues to live on Orcas Island, where she conducts tide
pool surveys at dawn and writes stories that make us question every
comfortable assumption we hold about the natural world.

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO is an ordained Jesuit priest and professor of
philosophy and theology at Loyola University in Baltimore whose science
fiction explores the intersection of faith and knowledge with a
seriousness and compassion that is unique in the genre. "The Weight of
Tomorrow" is his most agonizing story — a tale of a man who can see
the future and who must decide, again and again, whether to act on
what he sees. We published it with the conviction that science fiction
is the ideal genre for theological inquiry, and Father Aquino is the
ideal writer for the task. He writes in a small study overlooking a
garden, slowly and carefully, and the care shows on every page.

                         SIGNALS RECEIVED
                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Gunnar Eriksson's "The Wanderer's Rest" in Issue #20 was, I believe,
the most beautiful story you have published. I have read it four times
and each time I find something new — a detail, a cadence, a moment of
silence that somehow communicates more than speech. The generation ship
subgenre has produced many fine stories, but Eriksson's work exists on
a plane of its own. I eagerly await whatever he writes next, though I
suspect that whatever it is will require several hours of recovery
afterward.

                              — Dr. Elisabeth Franzen
                                 University of Gothenburg, Sweden

Dear Editor,

I must take issue with Rex Drummond's continued insistence on equipping
his characters with weapons that violate basic energy conservation. In
"Hell's Highway" (Issue #21), Captain Corvin fires a "plasma lance"
that apparently draws its power from nowhere, generates no waste heat,
and can be aimed with pinpoint accuracy while driving a vehicle at
several hundred kilometers per hour. This is, to put it charitably,
implausible. I realize that Mr. Drummond is not in the business of
scientific rigor, but a modicum of attention to thermodynamics would
not, I think, diminish his stories' entertainment value.

                              — Robert Chen
                                 Department of Physics
                                 MIT, Cambridge, Massachusetts

(Mr. Drummond, upon being shown Mr. Chen's letter, replied: "Tell the
professor I'll fix the thermodynamics when he learns to write a chase
scene." We are staying out of this one.                        — M.S.)

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Margaret Thornton's "The Ambassador's Garden" in Issue #21 was a
revelation. I am a horticulturist by profession and a science fiction
reader by inclination, and it is rare that I find both passions served
by a single story. Miss Thornton writes about plants the way Dr.
Koslov writes about stars — with a precision that is also poetry. I
would very much like to correspond with her about the chemical
signaling mechanisms she describes. Are they based on current
research?

                              — Mrs. Dorothy Appleton
                                 Brooklyn Botanic Garden
                                 Brooklyn, New York

(They are. Miss Thornton holds a master's degree in marine biology and
keeps current with the literature in chemical ecology. We have forwarded
your letter to her, and she replies that she would be delighted to
correspond.                                                    — M.S.)

Dear Sterling,

Father Aquino's "The Confession Booth" in Issue #20 was the first
science fiction story I have ever read in which a character's faith is
treated as something other than a problem to be solved or a
superstition to be overcome. I am not a Catholic, and I am not sure I
am a believer of any kind, but Father Aquino made me understand what
faith feels like from the inside, and that is a rare and valuable
thing. More, please.

                              — James Whitaker
                                 Portland, Oregon

We are grateful for these letters and for your continued engagement.
This month's issue is one of the most personal we have assembled, and
your responses to the stories that inspired it mean more than we can
express. Keep writing.                                         — M.S.

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

A MIRROR FOR OBSERVERS by Edgar Pangborn
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Pangborn has written a novel of quiet, persistent beauty — a
story of alien observers living among us and watching humanity with a
patience and compassion that we rarely extend to ourselves. The aliens
are not invaders; they are witnesses, and their presence raises
questions about the nature of observation, responsibility, and whether
watching a civilization stumble toward its own destruction constitutes
complicity or helplessness. The prose is luminous, the characterization
deep, and the moral questions genuinely unsettling. This is the kind
of science fiction that stays with you not because of its spectacle
but because of its silence — the things it does not say, the judgments
it refuses to render. Highly recommended.

BRAIN WAVE by Poul Anderson
(Ballantine Books, 1954, $0.35)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

What would happen if, overnight, every living creature on Earth
became dramatically more intelligent? Mr. Anderson explores this
premise with his characteristic blend of scientific rigor and
narrative energy, following the consequences as they ripple through
society: the animals who suddenly understand their captivity, the
workers who can no longer tolerate repetitive labor, the governments
that cannot govern a populace smarter than its leaders. The first half
is brilliant — a genuinely original thought experiment played out with
ruthless logic. The second half strains somewhat under the weight of
its own premise, as Anderson struggles to dramatize a level of
intelligence that exceeds the author's own. But the ambition is
magnificent, and the questions it raises about the relationship between
intelligence and happiness are worth the price of admission alone.
Recommended.

LONG TOMORROW by Leigh Brackett
(Doubleday, 1955, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Miss Brackett, known primarily for her planetary romances and her
screenwriting, has produced something unexpected: a sober, thoughtful
novel about a post-nuclear America that has constitutionally banned
cities and technology, and a young man who must decide whether to
accept the safety of agrarian simplicity or risk everything for the
possibility of knowledge. The world-building is superb — Brackett
renders her neo-rural America with the detail and conviction of
someone who has actually lived in it — and the protagonist's moral
dilemma is genuinely wrenching. If the ending is somewhat ambiguous,
that is perhaps appropriate for a novel about the impossibility of
choosing between safety and progress. A mature, ambitious work from
a writer whose range continues to surprise. Recommended with
admiration.

Issue #24 — December 1954 (Holiday Issue)

We are delighted to announce the contents of our first Holiday Issue,
which we believe is our most festive and varied collection to date:

"THE GIFT EQUATION" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — On a research station at
the edge of the solar system, a physicist discovers that the universe

holiday meditation on gratitude and wonder from our most rigorous
scientific voice.

"THE TOYMAKER OF TITAN" by Theodore Cain — An artisan who builds
handcrafted toys on Titan discovers that his creations are being
collected by an alien intelligence that does not understand play but
desperately wants to learn. A warm, surprising story from our most
versatile contributor.

"HOMECOMING" by Gunnar Eriksson — A generation ship receives a
transmission from the world it left behind, three centuries and
change too late. Eriksson's most emotionally devastating work to date,
which is saying something.

"SATURNALIA" by Rex Drummond — A holiday party aboard a pirate vessel
goes spectacularly wrong when the crew discovers that their stolen
cargo is alive, intelligent, and in a festive mood of its own.
Drummond at his most exuberant.
