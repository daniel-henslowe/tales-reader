TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

One year ago this month, you held in your hands the first issue of Tales
from the Future and Beyond. It was a slender thing — 120 pages, six
stories, and a great deal of editorial hope. I wrote in that inaugural
letter that the future was vast and that we had only begun to explore it.
I had no idea how right I would be, or how generous you would prove.

Twelve issues later, we are still here. More than still here — we are
growing. Beginning with this issue, we expand our page count to 148
pages, allowing us to feature longer stories and more substantial
editorial departments. Our subscription list has tripled. Our slush pile
has grown from a trickle to a torrent. And the quality of what arrives
in our mailbox — from established names and unknown hopefuls alike — has
exceeded every expectation I harbored when Meridian first gave me the
keys to this particular rocket ship.

This issue marks a new beginning in more ways than one, and I have
chosen its contents to reflect that theme. Dr. Vincent Koslov opens
our second year with "Planetfall," a story of colonists who arrive at
their promised world only to find the promises were optimistic. Theodore
Cain gives us a family's first year on Mars, told with his characteristic
warmth and precision. Rex Drummond rides again — this time as a space
marshal bringing law to a lawless asteroid. Harrison Blackwood returns
with a ghost story set among the stars that will, I promise, keep you
awake past your bedtime. Bob Finley explores the terrifying frontier of
memory itself. And Margaret Thornton takes us to a world where the
plants are alchemists and the science is stranger than any magic.

Six stories of new beginnings. Six visions of what it means to start
over, to arrive somewhere unknown, to reinvent oneself in the face of
the alien and the unexpected.

To our readers who have been with us from the first issue: thank you.
You built this magazine as much as any editor or author. To those
joining us for the first time with this issue: welcome aboard. The
voyage is just getting interesting.

Here is to year two.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond

                            PLANETFALL

                       by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                               I.

The colony ship Endeavour emerged from its final deceleration burn at
0347 hours Universal Time on the four hundred and twelfth day of the
mission's seventieth year, and the first thing Commander Lena Haraldsen
saw through the forward observation window was that the planet was the
wrong color.

It should have been blue-green. The spectroscopic data transmitted by
the Kepler Survey Probe in 1987 had been unambiguous: nitrogen-oxygen
atmosphere, liquid water oceans covering sixty-one percent of the
surface, chlorophyll-analogue signatures consistent with photosynthetic
ground cover across the temperate zones. The probe's summary report,
which had been reprinted in every school textbook on the ship for three
generations, included an artist's rendering of a world that looked
remarkably like Earth seen from low orbit — a marble of blue and green
and white, familiar and welcoming.

The planet hanging in the observation window was amber. A deep,
unsettling amber, like a bruise on a peach, streaked with bands of pale
yellow cloud and vast swathes of something that was neither ocean blue
nor vegetation green but a color that fell outside Haraldsen's immediate
vocabulary. The oceans, where she could see them between cloud
formations, were the color of weak tea.

"That," said Navigation Officer Patel, who was strapped into the
adjacent console and had been awake for fourteen hours managing the
deceleration sequence, "does not look like the brochure."

Haraldsen did not respond. She was running atmospheric composition
through the spectrometer array, and the numbers were scrolling across
her screen in a cascade that she was reading the way a physician reads
an electrocardiogram — quickly, professionally, with a growing sense
that something was very wrong.

Nitrogen: 72.3 percent. Acceptable. Oxygen: 19.1 percent. Low but
breathable. Carbon dioxide: 0.84 percent. High. Sulfur dioxide: 0.06
percent. The number stopped her. She read it again. She read it a third
time.

"Get Dr. Yuen up here," she said.

                               II.

Dr. Mei Yuen was the Endeavour's chief planetary scientist, a title she
had inherited from her mother, who had inherited it from a man named
Kowalski who had died of a stroke in the ship's forty-third year. The
position carried with it a small laboratory on Deck Seven, an archive
of planetary data that had not been updated since the probe's last
transmission in 1991, and the accumulated anxiety of three generations
of colonists who had staked everything — their lives, their children's
lives, their species' future — on the accuracy of data collected by
a robotic probe seventy years before their arrival.

Yuen was a compact woman of fifty-two with close-cropped gray hair and
the careful, deliberate movements of someone who had spent her entire
life in artificial gravity calibrated to 0.85 Earth standard. She
arrived on the command deck twelve minutes after being summoned, having
taken the time to dress properly and collect her instrument kit, and she
studied the spectrographic data for four minutes in silence before
speaking.

"The sulfur dioxide is volcanic," she said. "There's been significant
eruption activity since the probe's survey. The atmospheric sulfur is
driving a cascade — increased particulate scatter is shifting the
apparent color. The oceans." She paused, pulling up the liquid
spectroscopy. "The pH is approximately 4.2. Acidic. Sulfuric acid
contamination from the atmospheric sulfur dissolving into the
hydrosphere."

"The probe reported pH 7.8," Haraldsen said.

"The probe reported conditions seventy years ago. Planetary geology does
not hold still for human convenience."

Haraldsen absorbed this. Around her, the command deck was filling as
word spread through the ship's internal communications network — not
officially, because she had not authorized any announcement, but through
the informal channels that operated in any community of four thousand
people living in a metal cylinder. The whisper network. The looks
exchanged in corridors. The children who noticed that their parents were
walking faster than usual.

"Is the atmosphere breathable?" she asked.

"Technically, yes. The oxygen partial pressure is adequate. The sulfur
dioxide concentration is below the immediate toxicity threshold. Long-
term exposure would cause respiratory inflammation, possibly chronic
bronchitis. We would need filtration for sustained habitation."

"The soil?"

Yuen's expression changed — a minute tightening around her eyes that
Haraldsen had learned, over twenty years of working together, to read as
the closest Yuen came to alarm.

"I will need samples for definitive analysis. But based on the
atmospheric chemistry and the spectral data I can derive from orbit, I
would estimate significant heavy metal contamination — arsenic, cadmium,
lead — leached from the volcanic deposits. The probe surveyed a planet
in geological quiescence. We are looking at one in the aftermath of a
major eruptive cycle. The soil is almost certainly toxic to terrestrial
agriculture."

The command deck was very quiet.

"We cannot grow food," Haraldsen said. It was not a question.

"Not in the native soil. Not without extensive remediation that would
require resources and time we may not have."

Haraldsen turned to the observation window. The amber planet filled it,
vast and indifferent, slowly rotating beneath them in the light of its
star. She had been born on this ship. Her mother had been born on this
ship. Her grandmother had walked aboard at the Kennedy Departure
Facility in 2019 as a young environmental engineer carrying a suitcase
and a photograph of a house she would never return to, and everything
since — every birth, every death, every meal, every lesson, every
quarrel and reconciliation and quiet evening in the observation lounge —
had been in service of arriving at this moment.

They were here. And here was not what they had been promised.

"What about the megafauna?" Patel said, breaking the silence.

Everyone looked at him.

"The probe detected large-animal signatures in the temperate zones.
If the ecology has shifted this dramatically, we should assume the
fauna have shifted too."

Yuen nodded slowly. "The probe catalogued seventeen species above fifty
kilograms in the survey region. With this level of environmental
disruption, the surviving species will be adapted to the new conditions.
Hardier. More aggressive, potentially. The ecological pressure of a
major volcanic event selects for resilience."

"And we," Patel said, "are arriving as a new species in their
territory."

                               III.

The Endeavour carried 4,217 human beings. It carried eighteen years of
stored food at full rationing. It carried seed stock for forty-seven
terrestrial crop species and genetic material for twelve livestock
breeds. It carried construction equipment, medical supplies, educational
archives, cultural repositories, and the accumulated institutional
knowledge of a society that had maintained itself in transit for seven
decades. It did not carry enough fuel to go anywhere else.

This last fact was the one that shaped all subsequent decisions.

Haraldsen convened the Colony Council — twelve elected representatives
plus the department heads — in the ship's main assembly hall six hours
after the initial assessment. She presented the data without
editorializing. She let Yuen explain the atmospheric chemistry, let
Chief Engineer Okafor explain the fuel situation, let Agricultural
Director Singh explain the soil problem. She watched the faces of the
councillors as each briefing landed, watched the sequence of emotions —
disbelief, anger, fear, and then, in most of them, the hard-edged focus
of people who had been raised in a culture that treated problem-solving
as a moral imperative.

"We have eighteen years of food," Haraldsen said, when the briefings
were complete. "That is our window. In eighteen years, we must be
self-sustaining on the surface, or we will not sustain at all."

Councillor Brandt, who represented the ship's manufacturing sector and
who was the closest thing the Endeavour had to a political opposition
leader, spoke first. "The original mission plan assumed a six-month
transition to surface agriculture. You are now telling us that the
timeline is eighteen years."

"I am telling you that eighteen years is the outer limit. The timeline
for actual self-sufficiency depends on how quickly we can solve the soil
problem."

"And if we cannot solve it?"

The question hung in the recycled air of the assembly hall. Four
thousand people, Haraldsen thought. Children. Elderly. The youngest
born six months ago. The oldest eighty-nine years old and sharp as a
blade, a woman named Adler who remembered Earth and mentioned it
approximately once a year, always in the context of weather.

"Then we will face that when we face it," Haraldsen said. "For now, we
solve problems. That is what we do."

                               IV.

The first landing party descended to the surface on the seventh day
after orbital insertion. Shuttle Three carried a crew of twelve:
geologists, biologists, an atmospheric chemist, a civil engineer, and
two security officers carrying sidearms that had been manufactured aboard
the Endeavour and test-fired exactly once, in a cargo bay, resulting in
a ricochet that damaged a ventilation panel and a strongly worded memo
from Chief Engineer Okafor.

Yuen was aboard. She had insisted, and Haraldsen had not argued. There
are certain kinds of knowledge that cannot be acquired from orbit.

The landing site was a coastal plain in the northern temperate zone —
the same site the mission planners had selected seventy years ago, based
on the probe's data, as the optimal location for the initial settlement.
From orbit, it had looked like a broad, flat expanse of amber terrain
bordering a tea-colored sea. From the shuttle's descent trajectory, it
looked like a vast and alien emptiness, the horizon line unbroken by
any structure recognizable to human eyes.

The shuttle touched down at 1142 hours. Yuen was the first to step
onto the surface, carrying a sample kit and wearing a respirator mask
as a precaution, though the atmospheric readings inside the shuttle
showed breathable air.

The ground beneath her boots was a coarse, rust-colored soil that
crunched faintly with each step. The air that leaked around her mask
smelled of sulfur — not the choking reek of a volcanic vent, but a
persistent, low-grade acidity, like the ghost of a struck match. The
sky was a deep amber overhead, paling to a sickly yellow at the
horizon, where the sun — Kepler-442, slightly cooler and redder than
Sol — sat like a copper coin behind a scrim of particulate haze.

She knelt and drove a sample tube into the soil. The resistance was
moderate — not rock, not sand, but something between, a compacted
mineral matrix. She sealed the tube and placed it in her kit, then
took a second sample, then a third. Around her, the rest of the team
was fanning out across the landing zone, setting up atmospheric
monitoring stations and geological survey markers.

"Dr. Yuen." Security Officer Tanaka's voice, from forty meters to the
east. Calm but careful.

Yuen looked up. Tanaka was standing very still, his hand resting on
the sidearm at his hip, his eyes fixed on a point approximately two
hundred meters beyond the survey perimeter. Yuen followed his gaze
and felt something fundamental rearrange itself in her understanding
of the planet.

The animal was roughly the size and shape of a terrestrial bison, if a
bison had been redesigned by an engineer with a preference for armor
plating and an indifference to aesthetic convention. It stood on six
thick, columnar legs and was covered in overlapping plates of what
appeared to be calcite — a biological armor that gave it the appearance
of a living boulder. Its head was broad and flat, dominated by a bony
crest that rose above its skull like a shield, and below the crest were
two eyes the size of dinner plates, set wide apart and possessing a
luminous amber color that matched the sky with an exactness that seemed
almost deliberate.

It was watching them. It was watching them with the focused, evaluative
attention of a predator assessing unfamiliar prey, or a territorial
animal assessing an intruder in its range.

"Nobody move," Yuen said, very quietly, into the team's communication
channel.

The animal did not move either. For approximately ninety seconds, twelve
humans and one alien megafauna regarded each other across two hundred
meters of rust-colored soil on a planet that was nobody's first choice.

Then the animal turned, with a ponderous, unhurried grace, and walked
away. The ground trembled slightly with each step.

Yuen exhaled.

"Add 'territorial megafauna' to the assessment report," she said.

                               V.

The soil analysis confirmed Yuen's orbital projections and exceeded
them. Arsenic concentrations were fourteen times the safe threshold for
terrestrial agriculture. Cadmium was eleven times. The pH was 4.6 —
acidic enough to dissolve the root systems of most crop species within
weeks of planting. The mineral composition was dominated by volcanic
basalt derivatives that bound essential nutrients — phosphorus,
potassium — in forms inaccessible to terrestrial plant biology.

"In summary," Yuen told the Colony Council, "the soil is poison."

Agricultural Director Singh, a quiet, methodical man who had spent his
career maintaining the ship's hydroponic gardens, laid out the options.
Option one: soil remediation. Treat the native soil with calcium
carbonate to raise the pH, introduce chelating agents to bind the heavy
metals, amend with organic matter from the ship's compost reserves.
Estimated timeline to marginally arable soil: eight to twelve years.
Estimated probability of success: uncertain.

Option two: hydroponic expansion. Build surface greenhouses using
materials from the ship and grow crops in hydroponic systems, bypassing
the soil entirely. Limitation: the ship's hydroponic capacity could feed
approximately eight hundred people at full production. Scaling to four
thousand would require a manufacturing infrastructure that did not yet
exist on the surface.

Option three: some combination of both, pursued simultaneously, with the
hydroponics buying time while the soil remediation proceeded.

"Option three," Haraldsen said. "Obviously."

"Obviously," Singh agreed. "But I want the Council to understand what
'buying time' means. It means rationing. It means that every person on
this ship will eat less than they are accustomed to, for years. It means
we will be hungry. And hunger changes people."

Haraldsen looked around the Council table. She saw fear in some faces
and determination in others and, in Councillor Brandt's, a grim
satisfaction that his warnings about over-reliance on seventy-year-old
data were being vindicated.

"We will manage hunger," she said. "We have managed worse. We managed
seventy years in a metal tube."

"With adequate food supplies," Brandt said.

"With adequate food supplies and no planet to stand on. Now we have a
planet. It is not the planet we were promised. It is the planet we have.
And we will make it work, because the alternative is not available."

                               VI.

The first year on the surface of Kepler-442b — which the colonists began
calling Amber, for obvious reasons — was a chronicle of improvisation,
setback, and stubborn incremental progress.

The greenhouses went up first. Okafor's engineering teams cannibalized
non-essential sections of the Endeavour — recreation halls, secondary
cargo bays, the observation lounge where three generations had gone to
look at the stars — and repurposed the materials into pressurized
agricultural domes on the surface. The work was brutal: twelve-hour
shifts in respirator masks, in gravity fifteen percent higher than the
ship's artificial standard, in an atmosphere that left a sulfurous taste
on the tongue and an itch in the throat.

The hydroponic systems were operational within four months. Singh's team
planted the first crops — lettuce, radishes, soybeans, the fast-
turnover species — and watched them grow under artificial lighting in
filtered air while, outside the greenhouse walls, the amber sky pressed
down and the megafauna wandered the perimeter with their luminous eyes
and their ponderous, territorial patience.

The megafauna were a persistent problem. The initial survey identified
six species in the settlement region, ranging from the bison-sized
armored grazers — which the colonists called "tanks" — to a smaller,
faster predator species that moved in packs of eight to twelve and
displayed a distressing level of curiosity about human activity. The
predators, which someone nicknamed "jackals" despite their six legs and
their calcite armor and their utter lack of resemblance to any
terrestrial canid, tested the settlement's perimeter fencing within the
first week. The fencing held. The jackals adapted, probing for
weaknesses with a methodical intelligence that the biologists found
fascinating and the security team found alarming.

No one was killed by the fauna in the first year. Three people were
injured — one by a jackal that breached a damaged fence section, two by
a tank that charged a geological survey team that had inadvertently
approached a nesting site. The injuries were serious but recoverable.
The psychological impact was harder to measure.

The soil remediation proceeded slowly. Yuen's team spread calcium
carbonate across a ten-hectare test plot and introduced the chelating
agents that Singh's agricultural chemists had synthesized from the
ship's chemical stores. The pH climbed. The heavy metal concentrations
dropped. After six months, they planted a test crop of rye grass — the
hardiest species in their seed stock — and waited.

The rye grass germinated. It grew for eleven days, producing thin,
yellowish shoots that reached approximately four centimeters in height.
On the twelfth day, the shoots began to wilt. By the fourteenth day,
they were dead.

Yuen ran the analysis. The chelating agents had bound the arsenic and
cadmium as intended, but the soil's basaltic mineral matrix was
regenerating the toxic compounds through a weathering process that she
had not anticipated. The planet's geology was actively producing the
poison. It was not a static contamination to be cleaned up; it was a
dynamic process, ongoing, driven by the volcanic chemistry of the
bedrock itself.

She sat in her laboratory — a converted shipping container on the
surface, insulated against the sulfurous air — and stared at the data
for a long time.

Then she went to find Haraldsen.

                               VII.

"How long?" Haraldsen asked.

"If we increase the chelation rate by a factor of five and maintain
continuous application, we might achieve marginally arable soil in the
test plot within three years. But the mineral regeneration means we will
need to maintain the treatment indefinitely. We are not cleaning the
soil. We are suppressing an active process."

"Like a chronic illness."

"An apt analogy. The planet is not contaminated. The planet is, from our
agricultural perspective, inherently hostile. We are not remediating a
problem. We are fighting the planet's fundamental chemistry."

Haraldsen stood at the window of her office — also a converted shipping
container, also insulated, with a view of the greenhouse domes and,
beyond them, the amber plain stretching to the amber horizon. A herd of
tanks was grazing approximately a kilometer to the south, their calcite
armor catching the copper light of the sun and throwing it back in dull
flashes.

"Can we win?" she asked.

Yuen considered the question with her characteristic precision. "We can
establish a sustainable food supply. It will require a permanent
chemical infrastructure — a factory, essentially, devoted to continuous
soil treatment. It will require genetic modification of our crop species
to tolerate higher ambient toxicity. It will require decades of work and
a willingness to accept a margin of error that no mission planner on
Earth would have approved."

"Earth is seventy light-years away and has not heard from us in seventy
years. Earth's approval is not relevant."

"No. It is not."

Haraldsen turned from the window. She was forty-eight years old. She
had been born in a metal cylinder traveling at twelve percent of the
speed of light, and she had spent her entire life preparing for the
moment of arrival, and the moment of arrival had been nothing like the
preparation. She thought of her grandmother — Ingrid Haraldsen, the
environmental engineer, who had boarded the Endeavour at age twenty-six
carrying a photograph of a wooden house in Bergen, Norway, and who had
died in the ship's thirty-first year without ever setting foot on solid
ground again.

Ingrid had left behind a journal. Lena had read it many times. One
passage stayed with her:

"We did not choose this for ourselves. We chose it for the ones who
come after. Whether they will thank us or curse us, I cannot know. But
I know that they will be standing on a world that is not this ship, and
that will have to be enough."

It would have to be enough.

"Tell Singh to begin genetic modification protocols on the priority crop
list," Haraldsen said. "Tell Okafor I want the chemical processing
plant operational within six months. And tell Councillor Brandt that I
want a meeting with him this evening — not a Council session, a private
conversation. He has been right about several things, and I need him
working with us rather than against us."

Yuen nodded and turned to leave.

"Mei."

Yuen stopped.

"The rye grass. The test plot. Plant it again."

"It will fail again."

"Plant it again anyway. And when it fails, plant it again. We will keep
planting until something grows, or until we learn enough from the
failures to make something grow. That is the mission now."

Yuen regarded her commander with an expression that contained, beneath
its characteristic precision, something that might have been admiration.

"Understood," she said.

                               VIII.

In the second year, the rye grass grew to six centimeters before dying.

In the third year, it grew to twelve.

In the fourth year, a genetically modified strain — developed by Singh's
team from seed stock that had been irradiated, cross-bred, and subjected
to selection pressures that would have baffled the original mission
geneticists — grew to thirty centimeters and survived for eighty-one
days before the mineral toxicity overwhelmed its modified tolerance.

In the fifth year, a second-generation modified strain grew to full
maturity, produced seed, and was harvested. The yield was negligible.
The nutritional content was marginal. The taste, according to Singh, who
insisted on being the first to eat it, was "reminiscent of cardboard
that has been stored near a sulfur mine."

He ate it with tears on his face.

The chemical processing plant was operational by the end of year two.
It consumed enormous quantities of energy — drawn from the Endeavour's
reactors, which had been repurposed as a surface power station — and
produced the chelating agents and soil amendments in volumes that would
have been economically absurd on Earth but were existentially necessary
on Amber.

The greenhouses expanded. By year three, the hydroponic systems were
feeding two thousand people. By year five, twenty-eight hundred. The
remaining fourteen hundred were fed from the ship's stored supplies,
which were diminishing on a curve that Singh tracked on a chart in his
office with the grim attentiveness of a man watching a candle burn
toward his fingers.

The megafauna adapted to the human presence with the pragmatic
flexibility of species that had survived a volcanic apocalypse. The
tanks avoided the settlement, rerouting their grazing patterns around
the perimeter in a wide arc that the biologists interpreted as a
territorial concession. The jackals were less accommodating. They
learned to avoid the electrified perimeter fencing but discovered that
the greenhouse domes had seams, and twice in the third year they
penetrated the agricultural enclosure and caused significant crop
damage before being driven out.

After the second incursion, Haraldsen authorized lethal force protocols
against jackals that breached the perimeter. The decision was
controversial. The colony's biologists argued that the jackals were
simply behaving as territorial predators confronted with a new
competitor, and that killing them was ecologically reckless. The
security team argued that crop damage was an existential threat. The
Colony Council debated for three days.

Haraldsen listened to every argument and then made the decision she
had already made before the debate began. "We will defend our food
supply. We will do so with restraint and with respect for the ecology
we are entering. But we will defend it."

The jackals learned. Within six months, they stopped testing the
perimeter. The biologists noted that they had redirected their
predatory attention toward the tank herds — a behavioral shift that
suggested a cognitive flexibility the initial surveys had not
predicted.

"They are problem-solvers," the lead biologist, Dr. Tanaka — the
same Tanaka who had been a security officer on the first landing party
and had since retrained, following the path that interested him rather
than the one he had been assigned — told Haraldsen in his year-five
report. "They assess, they adapt, they try new strategies. They are
not intelligent in any way we would recognize as sapient. But they are
very, very good at surviving."

"So are we," Haraldsen said.

                               IX.

On the first day of the seventh year, Lena Haraldsen walked out of the
settlement alone. She wore a respirator — the sulfur concentration had
dropped over the years as the volcanic cycle waned, but long-term
exposure protocols still required filtration — and she carried nothing
else. She walked past the greenhouses, past the chemical plant with
its hissing condensers and its permanent smell of processed sulfur,
past the perimeter fence with its warning signs, and out onto the amber
plain.

The ground was firmer here, away from the remediated zones. The native
soil, untreated, crunched beneath her boots with its characteristic
mineral rasp. The sky was lighter than it had been on arrival day —
the volcanic haze was thinning, year by year, and on clear days the
amber shifted toward something that was almost gold, a color that had
no name in any terrestrial language but that the colony's children,
who had never seen another sky, simply called "the color of the sky."

She walked for twenty minutes, until the settlement was a cluster of
domes and containers on the horizon behind her and the plain stretched
ahead in every direction, empty and vast and utterly alien.

A tank was grazing approximately three hundred meters to the north.
It raised its massive head as she stopped, regarded her with its
luminous amber eyes, and then returned to its grazing. It had assessed
her. She was not a threat.

Haraldsen removed her respirator. She had been told not to do this.
She did it anyway. She breathed in the air of the planet — sulfurous,
mineral, strange — and felt it fill her lungs, and she stood there for
a long time, breathing, looking at the sky that was the wrong color
above a world that was the wrong world, and she thought about her
grandmother's journal, and about rye grass, and about the fact that
the seventh-year crop yield had been large enough to feed four hundred
people.

Not enough. Not yet. But the curve was bending.

She put the respirator back on and walked back to the settlement, where
there were problems to solve, and decisions to make, and four thousand
people who needed her to believe that the curve would continue to bend.

She believed it. Not because the data guaranteed it. But because the
alternative to belief was despair, and despair was a luxury that no
commander of a colony on a hostile world could afford.

Behind her, the tank watched her go with its amber eyes. Then it
lowered its head and resumed grazing on vegetation that had adapted,
over millions of years, to thrive in toxic soil under a sulfurous sky.

The planet did not care whether the humans survived. The planet would
continue its slow geological processes regardless — erupting, cooling,
weathering, regenerating its mineral poisons, spinning in its orbit
around its copper-colored star.

But the rye grass was growing.

And in the greenhouse nearest the settlement's center, a child named
Soren — Lena's nephew, born on the surface, the first generation that
would never know the inside of the ship — was eating a bowl of grain
porridge made from the first harvest, and he was asking for seconds.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         FIRST HOUSE ON MARS

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

The house wasn't much to look at. A prefab dome, twelve meters across,
stamped out of aluminum alloy at the Burroughs Manufacturing Plant in
the lowlands and trucked up to the building site on a flatbed crawler.
It sat on a concrete pad in the shadow of Olympus Mons — though
"shadow" was generous, since the mountain was so vast that its shadow
was less a shadow than a slow regional dimming, like the sun going
behind a cloud that stretched from horizon to horizon.

Tom Kessler stood in the doorway of the dome and looked out at Mars.

It was not a scenic view, exactly. The landscape was rust-colored
regolith in every direction, flat as a griddle, dotted with rocks that
ranged from fist-sized to car-sized, and presided over by a sky that
couldn't decide if it was pink or butterscotch. Olympus Mons rose to
the northwest, but you couldn't really see it from ground level — it
was too big, too gradual. It was less a mountain than a general
upwardness in the terrain, a tilt in the world that the eye registered
without the mind quite believing.

"Well?" said Ellen, coming up behind him. She was holding a box labeled
KITCHEN — FRAGILE and wearing the expression she wore when she was
determined to be cheerful about something she wasn't sure about.

"It's roomy," Tom said.

"It's Mars."

"That too."

She set the box down and stood beside him. Their daughter, Gracie, was
somewhere inside the dome making ownership noises — the territorial
sounds of a nine-year-old establishing dominion over a new bedroom.

"She'll need curtains," Ellen said.

"For what windows?"

"She'll need curtains anyway. It's a principle."

Tom nodded. His wife's faith in principles — curtains, mealtimes,
birthday parties, the civilizing rituals of domestic life — was the
reason they were here. Not the only reason. The company had offered a
relocation package that was hard to turn down: free housing, a twenty
percent salary bump, priority schooling for dependents. Tom was an
atmospheric systems engineer, and Mars needed atmospheric systems
engineers the way a leaky boat needs a man with a bucket. But it was
Ellen who had said yes. Ellen who had looked at the brochures with
their artist's renderings of domed communities and hydroponic gardens
and children playing in pressurized courtyards, and who had said, "We
could build something there. Something from the beginning."

Something from the beginning. That was Ellen's phrase, and it meant
more than a house on Mars. It meant starting fresh. It meant making a
home in a place that had no precedent for homes, where every tradition
would have to be invented from scratch.

Tom thought it was either the bravest or the most foolish idea his wife
had ever had. He suspected it was both.

                               *

The first week was logistics. Unpacking crates. Connecting the water
reclamation system. Calibrating the atmospheric processors, which Tom
did himself because he didn't trust anyone else to get the humidity
balance right — too dry and your sinuses cracked; too wet and the dome's
interior surfaces grew a gray-green mold that the colony doctor called
"Martian penicillin" and that Tom called "evidence of professional
failure."

The dome had four rooms: a combined living area and kitchen, two
bedrooms, and a bathroom with a shower that recycled ninety-six percent
of its water and produced a pressure that Ellen described as "being
breathed on by a tired dog." The walls were bare aluminum. The floor
was textured composite. The whole place had the aesthetic warmth of the
inside of a filing cabinet.

"We need paint," Ellen said on the third day.

"Paint isn't in the supply allocation."

"Then we need to find paint."

She found paint. Tom never learned exactly how. There was a network
among the colony wives — and some of the husbands, and a few people
who were neither but who understood that civilization was built from
small acts of domestic stubbornness — a barter economy of favors and
surplus materials that operated outside the official supply chain. Ellen
came home on the fifth day with three cans of paint: one blue, one
yellow, one white. The blue was intended for atmospheric sensor
housings. The yellow was a corrosion-resistant coating for water
pipes. The white was actual paint, liberated from some unspecified
source that Ellen declined to name.

They painted Gracie's room blue. They painted the kitchen yellow. They
left the living room white and the bedrooms aluminum, because even
Ellen's network had limits.

"It looks like a home," Ellen said, standing in the kitchen with yellow
paint on her hands and a streak of it in her hair.

It looked like a kitchen that had been painted with pipe coating. But
Tom understood what she meant, and she was right. It looked like
someone lived there. It looked like someone intended to stay.

                               *

Gracie adjusted faster than either of her parents. Children do. Within
two weeks, she had memorized the layout of the colony's pressurized
corridors, made three friends, acquired a pet — a small, harmless
bacteriological culture in a sealed jar that the colony biologist had
given her and that she named "Mr. Wiggles" despite its lack of any
discernible wiggles — and declared that Mars was "okay but it needs a
dog."

She attended the colony school, which met in a repurposed storage dome
and was taught by Mrs. Okafor, a former university professor who had
followed her geologist husband to Mars and who brought to the education
of eleven children the same rigor she had once applied to doctoral
candidates. Gracie came home with assignments that Tom found
surprisingly challenging: calculate the delta-v required for an Earth-
Mars transfer orbit. Explain why the sky is pink. Write an essay about
what you miss from Earth.

Gracie's essay, which Ellen found on the kitchen table and read aloud
to Tom that evening, said: "I miss grass. I miss the sound it makes
when you walk on it. Mars sounds different. On Mars everything sounds
like the inside of a building even when you are outside."

Tom thought about that for a long time.

                               *

The seasons on Mars were long. They'd arrived in early autumn — by the
colony's adapted calendar, which mapped Martian sols onto a framework
that bore a familial resemblance to the Gregorian system the way a
second cousin bears a resemblance to your face. Autumn meant the dust
storms were coming.

The first one arrived in their third month. Tom had been briefed. He'd
read the technical specifications. He'd calibrated the dome's filtration
systems to handle particulate loads three times the normal atmospheric
concentration. He was prepared, technically.

He was not prepared for the sound.

It came on slowly, like a train approaching from a great distance — a
low, grinding hiss that built over hours into a roar that was less heard
than felt, a vibration in the bones, in the floor, in the aluminum
walls of the dome. The sky turned from butterscotch to rust to
something close to black, and the wind — thin, inadequate Martian air
that barely qualified as atmosphere — drove particles of iron oxide
against the dome's exterior in a sustained abrasive whisper that went
on for two days.

Gracie was terrified. She crawled into her parents' bed on the first
night and stayed for both. Tom held her and told her it was just wind,
just dust, that the dome was built to withstand it — which was true,
technically, though the filtration system was running at ninety-two
percent capacity and the atmospheric alarms had tripped twice.

Ellen made hot chocolate. This was a significant act. Chocolate was a
luxury item on Mars, rationed to fifty grams per person per month, and
hot chocolate required both chocolate and heated water, the latter of
which consumed energy that was itself rationed. Making hot chocolate
during a dust storm was, by strict accounting, an irresponsible use
of resources.

Ellen made it anyway. She made it with powdered milk and a pinch of
sugar, and she poured it into three cups, and they sat in the kitchen —
yellow-painted, warm, smelling of chocolate — while the storm raged
outside, and they drank it, and Gracie stopped shaking.

"This is what houses are for," Ellen said.

                               *

Winter came. On Mars, winter was not a season of snow and cold — not at
their latitude, anyway — but of reduced solar input, shorter days, and
the particular psychological weight of knowing that the closest warm
place was approximately 225 million kilometers away. The colony's energy
budget tightened. The heating systems in the domes were dialed back to
conserve reactor fuel, and the temperature inside the Kessler dome
dropped to a level that Tom maintained was "bracing" and that Ellen
called "unacceptable."

She solved this with blankets. More precisely, she organized a quilting
circle.

Tom came home one evening to find six women and two men sitting in his
living room, sewing. They had fabric — repurposed from worn-out
clothing, damaged bedsheets, and in one case a cargo tarp that had been
cut into squares — and they were assembling it into quilts with the
focused determination of people engaged in an act of defiance against
the thermodynamics of an inadequately heated habitat.

"We're making warmth," Ellen told him.

"I can see that."

"Sit down. I'll teach you a stitch."

Tom sat down. He learned a stitch. The quilt they produced that evening
was ugly — a patchwork of mismatched colors and incompatible textures
that looked like it had been assembled by a committee of well-meaning
lunatics. They put it on Gracie's bed, and she slept warm that night,
and the next night, and the night after that.

The quilting circle met weekly for the rest of the winter. By spring,
every family in the colony had at least one quilt, and Ellen had
established herself as the unofficial social director of the settlement,
a role she performed with a quiet competence that Tom found slightly
terrifying.

                               *

Spring on Mars brought two things: longer days and the garden.

The garden was Ellen's project, and it was, by any rational measure,
absurd. Growing plants in Martian soil was technically possible — the
regolith could be treated with perchlorates-removing bacteria and
amended with compost from the colony's waste processing system — but
it required a pressurized enclosure, supplemental lighting, constant
atmospheric monitoring, and more water than the allocation system could
justify.

Ellen did it anyway. She requisitioned a small pressurized greenhouse —
three meters by two, barely larger than a closet — and she set it up
adjacent to the dome, connected by a short pressurized corridor that
Tom built from spare atmospheric ducting on a weekend when he should
have been recalibrating the colony's primary air handlers.

She planted tomatoes. Cherry tomatoes, specifically — a compact variety
that the colony agricultural team had been developing for Martian
conditions. She tended them with the concentrated attention of a woman
who understood that she was doing something more important than growing
tomatoes.

Gracie helped. She watered the plants every morning before school, using
a hand-held sprayer that delivered precisely measured doses of recycled
water. She made a chart on the greenhouse wall tracking the height of
each plant, labeling them with names — "Big Red," "Stumpy," "Princess
Tomato" — and she talked to them, because Mrs. Okafor had told her
that some studies suggested plants responded to sound vibrations, and
Gracie took this as scientific authorization to narrate her entire day
to a row of tomato seedlings.

The tomatoes grew. Slowly, stubbornly, in their little pressurized
closet on the side of a dome on the slope of the largest volcano in the
solar system, they grew. They produced flowers in their ninth week.
They produced fruit in their fourteenth.

The first ripe tomato was small, misshapen, and a shade of red that
was closer to orange. Tom picked it on a Tuesday evening, and the three
of them stood in the greenhouse and looked at it sitting in his palm
like a jewel.

"Who gets to eat it?" Gracie asked.

"We share it," Ellen said.

Tom cut it into three pieces with a kitchen knife. They each ate a
piece. It was, Tom thought, the most extraordinary tomato he had ever
tasted — sweet and acidic and bursting with a flavor that was
concentrated by the small, imperfect conditions of its growth, the way
pressure concentrates carbon into diamond.

Gracie chewed hers thoughtfully.

"It tastes like Earth," she said.

She had been four when they left Earth. Tom doubted she remembered what
Earth tomatoes tasted like. But he understood what she meant. It tasted
like something from before. It tasted like the memory of a place that
still existed somewhere, very far away, where tomatoes grew in open
fields under an open sky.

"It tastes like home," Ellen said, and she was not talking about Earth.

                               *

Summer brought heat and light and the slow, accumulating rhythms of a
life that was beginning to feel less like an expedition and more like a
neighborhood. The colony grew. New families arrived on the quarterly
transport — the Nguyens, the Okonkwos, the family from Helsinki whose
name Tom could never pronounce and who he thought of privately as "the
Finns," which was accurate if unimaginative. New domes went up on the
building pads. The pressurized corridors extended. The school acquired
a second teacher.

Tom's work settled into a routine. He maintained the atmospheric systems
for the colony's residential section — seventeen domes, each one a
small sealed world that depended on his calculations for every breath
its occupants drew. The work was demanding and repetitive and absolutely
essential, which was the kind of work Tom had always been best at: the
invisible infrastructure that made everything else possible.

Ellen's quilting circle evolved into something larger — a community
association that organized social events, mediated neighbor disputes,
maintained a lending library of physical books that had been carried
from Earth at enormous cost per kilogram, and ran a weekly movie night
in the recreation dome using a projector that was older than Gracie and
a screen made from a cargo tarp that was, in a former life, one of
Ellen's quilting supplies.

Gracie turned ten. Ellen organized a birthday party, which involved
inviting every child in the colony — all nineteen of them — and
producing a cake. The cake was made from colony-standard flour, recycled
water, powdered eggs, and a quantity of sugar that Ellen had been
hoarding for three months. It was not a good cake by any terrestrial
standard. It was dense and slightly gritty and flavored with synthetic
vanilla that tasted more like plastic than like beans from a tropical
orchid.

It was also the first birthday cake baked on Mars, and Gracie blew out
her candles — actual candles, which were contraband in a sealed
atmospheric environment, but Ellen had judged the fire risk acceptable
for ten seconds of ceremony — and made a wish.

"What did you wish for?" Tom asked.

"I can't tell you. It won't come true."

"That's an Earth superstition. Maybe Mars has different rules."

"Mars doesn't have any rules yet," Gracie said, with the devastating
logic of a ten-year-old. "We're making them up."

She was right. They were making them up. Every tradition, every custom,
every small domestic ritual — mealtimes and bedtimes and birthday
candles and hot chocolate during dust storms — was being invented, right
now, by the people who were living them. There was no precedent. There
was no manual. There was only a collection of families in aluminum domes
on an alien world, figuring out, day by day, what it meant to be at
home.

                               *

Autumn came again. The dust storms returned, and this time Gracie did
not crawl into her parents' bed. She stayed in her own room, under her
quilt, and read a book by flashlight while the wind screamed outside
and the dome hummed with the effort of keeping the Martian atmosphere
where it belonged — outside.

Tom checked on her at midnight. She was asleep with the book open on
her chest, the flashlight still on, the quilt pulled up to her chin.
He turned off the flashlight, closed the book, and stood there for a
moment in the blue-painted room, listening to his daughter breathe the
air he maintained.

One year on Mars. One Martian year, which was nearly two Earth years,
which meant that the time had come and gone when they could have
requested a transfer back on the quarterly transport. They hadn't
requested it. Neither of them had mentioned it.

He went back to the living room, where Ellen was sitting on the couch
with a cup of tea — actual tea, a small luxury she permitted herself —
reading a letter from her sister on Earth that had taken fourteen
minutes to arrive at the speed of light.

"We're staying," Tom said. It wasn't a question.

Ellen looked up from her letter. "Of course we're staying."

"Because of the tomatoes?"

"Because of the curtains."

Tom didn't understand, and then he did. The curtains Gracie didn't need,
for windows the dome didn't have. The paint that wasn't paint. The
quilts made from cargo tarps. The birthday cake that tasted like
synthetic vanilla and love. All of it — every small, stubborn act of
domesticity, every insistence that this bare metal dome on this barren
rust-colored planet was a home — had been a declaration. Not of comfort
but of commitment. Not of contentment but of intent.

We are here. We are staying. This is ours now.

Outside, the dust storm howled. Inside, the dome was warm, and painted,
and smelled faintly of the tomatoes that were ripening in the
greenhouse, and the air was exactly right because Tom Kessler made sure
of it, and it was, in every way that mattered, home.

"I'll put the kettle on," Tom said.

"There's enough for two cups," Ellen said.

He put the kettle on. The water boiled. He poured the tea. They sat
together on the couch in the white-painted living room of the first
house on Mars, drinking tea and listening to the storm, and they did
not talk about Earth.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         IRON MARSHAL

                        by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

                               I.

The man who stepped off the ore shuttle at Ceres Station didn't look
like much. He was tall and lean, with a weathered face that suggested
he'd spent more time squinting into suns than sitting behind desks, and
he wore a long duster coat of gray ballistic weave that hung to his
boots. His boots were scuffed. His hat was the wide-brimmed kind that
miners called a "rock shield" — useful for keeping gravel out of your
eyes in the low-gravity tunnels where ceiling debris had a lazy, deadly
habit of floating down when you least expected it.

He carried a single duffel bag over his left shoulder. On his right hip,
in a quick-draw holster that was worn smooth from use, rode a Colt-
Vickers Model 7 railgun — the kind the military called a "persuader"
and civilians called a "peacemaker," because the only peace it made was
the permanent kind.

His name was Boone Taggart, and he was the law.

Not that anyone on Ceres Station had asked for the law. That was the
thing about law in the Belt — it didn't wait for an invitation. It
showed up when the body count got high enough to make the newspapers
back on Earth, and the politicians in Washington decided that something
had to be done about these lawless mining colonies, and some bureaucrat
in the newly formed United States Space Marshal Service drew a name out
of a hat and said, "You. Go fix it."

Taggart had been fixing things for six years now. He'd cleaned up
Pallas Station, where the tungsten miners had been running a protection
racket that made the old Chicago mobs look like church deacons. He'd
brought order to the Trojan camps at Jupiter's L4 point, where three
rival mining consortiums had been settling their disputes with shaped
charges and the occasional "accidental" airlock failure. He'd tracked a
murderer across the entire breadth of the asteroid belt, from Vesta to
Hygiea, in a one-man patrol ship with a busted heater and a radio that
worked on alternate Tuesdays.

He was forty-three years old. He'd been shot four times, stabbed twice,
and blown out of an airlock once — that one had cost him his left ear,
which had been replaced with a prosthetic that was slightly the wrong
color and gave his face a lopsided, disreputable quality. He did not
smile often. When he did, it was the kind of smile that made people
check their exits.

He stepped off the shuttle ramp and onto the scarred metal deck of
Docking Bay Seven, and the first thing he noticed was that nobody was
there to meet him.

The second thing he noticed was that somebody had welded the words
GO HOME across the bay's inner airlock in letters a foot high.

The third thing he noticed was the sniper.

Taggart dropped flat half a second before the railgun slug ripped
through the space where his head had been. The slug hit the shuttle's
hull behind him with a sound like God banging a gong and ricocheted off
into the ceiling, punching through a ventilation duct and releasing a
hiss of pressurized air.

Taggart rolled behind a cargo loader, drew his Colt-Vickers, and put
three rounds into the catwalk above Docking Bay Seven in the time it
took his heart to beat twice. The first two shots sparked off metal. The
third one found something soft.

A body tumbled off the catwalk and hit the deck with the slow,
dream-like grace that low gravity gave to all falling objects. Taggart
watched it settle, then stood up, holstered his weapon, and picked up
his duffel bag.

"Howdy," he said to no one in particular. "Nice to be here."

                               II.

Ceres Station was the biggest mining settlement in the Belt, and it was
exactly as ugly as you'd expect from a place that had been built by
people who cared about ore tonnage and didn't give a tin damn about
aesthetics. The station had been carved into the asteroid itself — a
warren of tunnels, caverns, and pressurized domes that spread through
the rock like wormholes through an apple. The main settlement held
about three thousand souls, if you used the word "souls" loosely, and
it sprawled across a dozen interconnected caverns that the locals had
given names like Main Street, the Gulch, the Pit, and — with the grim
humor that was the Belt's primary cultural export — Sunshine Boulevard,
which hadn't seen actual sunshine since the Cretaceous.

Taggart walked down Main Street with his duffel over his shoulder and
his duster coat sweeping the ground behind him, and he counted the ways
this place was broken.

The overhead lights flickered — power grid problems, probably from
someone tapping the main lines to run unauthorized smelting operations.
The air had a metallic tang that said the scrubbers were overdue for
maintenance. Half the storefronts on Main Street were shuttered, their
owners either run off or bought out or buried in the recycler. The ones
that were still open had steel shutters on their windows and the kind
of twitchy, don't-make-eye-contact energy that said the proprietors
were paying for the privilege of staying in business.

Protection money. The oldest racket in human history, transplanted
faithfully from Earth to the stars, because humanity could travel
four hundred million kilometers from home and still find new places
to be rotten to each other.

The miners he passed gave him looks that ranged from hostile to curious
to carefully blank. They were a rough-looking bunch — men and women
both, because the Belt didn't discriminate by gender, only by how much
tonnage you could move. They wore the standard mining coveralls in
various states of repair, and most of them carried tools that could
double as weapons without much imagination.

Nobody spoke to him. Nobody needed to. The badge on his chest — a
silver star with USMS engraved beneath it — said everything that needed
saying, and the welcome it received was about as warm as the vacuum
outside.

Taggart found the station's administrative office at the end of Main
Street, in a dome that had originally been designed as a greenhouse
before someone decided that paperwork was more essential than lettuce.
The administrator was a thin, nervous man named Clement Voigt who had
the look of someone who had been promoted beyond his competence and
knew it.

"Marshal Taggart," Voigt said, half-rising from his desk. "We weren't
expecting you until next week."

"I get that a lot," Taggart said. He dropped his duffel in the corner
and sat down in the chair across from Voigt's desk without being
invited. "Tell me about Harlan Drake."

Voigt's face did something complicated. It tried to look innocent, then
confused, then settled on a kind of queasy neutrality that was
convincing to absolutely no one.

"Drake? He's — well, he operates the Ceresian Mining Consortium. One
of the larger operations out here. A businessman."

"Uh-huh." Taggart took off his hat and set it on his knee. His hair
was gray and cut short enough to suggest military habits that hadn't
quite died. "The kind of businessman who takes a sixty percent cut of
every independent miner's haul? The kind who runs the only supply depot
and charges four times the going rate for oxygen? The kind who settles
disagreements by putting people in airlocks and hitting the red button?"

Voigt swallowed. "I wouldn't know anything about —"

"Fourteen bodies in the last eight months, Voigt. Fourteen people dead,
and not one report filed with the Colonial Authority. That's why I'm
here. Now you can help me, or you can sit there and pretend you don't
know what I'm talking about, but I should warn you — I have a real low
tolerance for pretending."

Voigt looked at the door, then at the walls, then at his desk, as if
any of these surfaces might provide an escape route.

"He's going to kill you," Voigt said quietly. "He knew you were coming.
He's known for weeks. That man on the catwalk — that was just the
welcome mat. Drake wants you to know that he's ready for you."

Taggart smiled his exit-checking smile. "Good," he said. "I hate
surprises."

                               III.

The Rusty Nail was the closest thing Ceres Station had to a respectable
saloon, which was like saying a rattlesnake was the closest thing the
desert had to a house pet. It occupied a pressurized cavern about fifty
meters long and twenty wide, with a bar made from reclaimed cargo
containers, tables built from mining equipment crates, and lighting that
came from a mix of industrial overheads and strings of colored bulbs
that somebody had salvaged from a Christmas shipment three years ago and
never taken down.

The place was crowded when Taggart walked in, and it got very quiet
very fast.

He took a seat at the bar. The bartender was a big woman with arms like
hydraulic pistons and a face that said she'd heard every story in the
human catalog and hadn't been impressed by any of them. Her name tag
said GRETA.

"Whiskey," Taggart said.

"We got grain alcohol with flavor additive," Greta said.

"Then I'll have that."

She poured it. Taggart drank it. It tasted like someone had filtered
jet fuel through a dirty sock and then apologized to the sock.

"Good," he lied.

"No it isn't," Greta said.

"No it isn't," Taggart agreed. "Hit me again."

He was on his second glass of regret when the doors banged open and
Harlan Drake walked in with six men behind him.

Drake was not what Taggart had expected. The reports had painted him as
a brute — a thug who'd muscled his way to the top of Ceres Station's
food chain through violence and intimidation. And maybe that was true,
but the man who walked into the Rusty Nail didn't look like a thug.
He was medium height, medium build, with a neatly trimmed beard and
the calm, appraising eyes of a man who was used to calculating risks
and finding them acceptable. He wore a clean suit — a real suit, not
coveralls, which on Ceres Station was the equivalent of wearing a
crown — and he moved with the controlled precision of someone who
had spent enough time in low gravity to make it look natural.

His six men spread out behind him in a formation that was professional
enough to tell Taggart they'd done this before. They were armed.
Railguns, mostly, with one man carrying a short-barreled scatter gun
that would turn a corridor into a kill box.

"Marshal Taggart," Drake said, and his voice was smooth and modulated,
the voice of a man who'd learned that speaking softly was more
frightening than shouting. "Welcome to Ceres Station. I apologize for
the incident at the docking bay. The man who fired on you was acting
without authorization, and I assure you he would have been disciplined
if you hadn't — well." He glanced at his men. "Disciplined him
yourself."

"Real thoughtful of you," Taggart said.

Drake sat down on the stool next to him, as casual as a man settling
in for a friendly drink. His men stayed standing, positioned around
the room with the kind of spacing that covered all the angles.

"I'll be direct with you, Marshal. I'm a practical man, and I respect
your office. But you should understand the situation here. Ceres
Station is four hundred million kilometers from the nearest courtroom.
The Colonial Authority's jurisdiction is, let's say, theoretical. And
the people of this station — my people — have built something here.
It's rough, I'll grant you. It's imperfect. But it works."

"Fourteen dead people might disagree with 'works,'" Taggart said.

Drake waved a hand — a small, dismissive gesture. "The Belt is
dangerous. Mining is dangerous. Accidents happen."

"A man with his hands tied behind his back doesn't accidentally get
shoved out an airlock."

"An unfortunate incident. The perpetrator was dealt with."

"By you."

"By the community." Drake's eyes were steady, unblinking. "Marshal,
I'm going to make you an offer, and I want you to consider it
carefully. Go home. File whatever report you need to file. Tell
Washington that Ceres Station is in order, that the situation has been
resolved. I'll even give you a name — someone expendable — that you
can bring back as a trophy. Everyone wins."

Taggart finished his drink. Set the glass down. Looked at Drake for a
long moment.

"That's a generous offer," Taggart said.

"I'm a generous man."

"But I've got a counter-offer." Taggart stood up. He was a head taller
than Drake, and he used every inch of it. "You turn yourself in. Right
now. I put you in custody, we wait for the next transport, and you
stand trial back on Earth like a civilized human being. In return, I
don't come after your organization. Your people keep their operations.
Nobody else has to get hurt."

The silence in the Rusty Nail was the kind of silence that precedes
either a handshake or a gunfight. Every person in the room knew it.

Drake studied Taggart's face. Whatever he was looking for, he didn't
find it.

"I'm sorry to hear that, Marshal," Drake said. "I truly am."

He stood, buttoned his jacket, and walked toward the door. His men
followed, covering the room as they withdrew. At the door, Drake
paused and looked back.

"Ceres Station is a big place, Marshal. Lots of tunnels. Lots of dark
corners. Lots of ways for a man to get lost." He smiled — a small,
precise smile that didn't touch his eyes. "I'd hate for that to happen
to you."

The door closed behind him.

Taggart looked at Greta. "Hit me one more time."

She poured. "You've got sand, Marshal. I'll give you that."

"Sand is about all I've got right now."

"You've also got about twelve hours before he sends someone to kill
you. Just so you know."

Taggart drank. "I appreciate the heads-up."

"Don't mention it. That'll be three credits for the drinks."

He paid and walked out into the flickering light of Main Street,
and the weight of three thousand hostile souls pressed down on him
like gravity.

                               IV.

The cell they gave him for a bunk was a converted storage closet near
the administrative section — four meters by three, with a cot, a
locker, and a ventilation grate that wheezed like an asthmatic dog.
Taggart locked the door, wedged a chair under the handle, and sat on
the cot with his railgun across his knees.

He thought about the situation.

Drake was smart. That was the first problem. A stupid crime boss was
easy — you kicked in the door, slapped on the cuffs, and went home for
dinner. But a smart one knew how to make himself necessary. Drake
controlled the supply lines, the oxygen, the water, the power grid. He
had made himself the infrastructure of Ceres Station. Taking him down
wasn't like pulling out a tumor — it was like pulling out a spine. The
body couldn't function without it.

Which meant Taggart needed an alternative spine.

He dug into his duffel and pulled out a data pad. On it were the files
he'd compiled during the six-week trip from Earth — personnel records,
mining output reports, financial data, shipping manifests. Somewhere in
this station, there were people who hated Drake enough to fight him.
Taggart just had to find them.

He worked through the night, cross-referencing names and records,
building a picture of Ceres Station's power structure the way a
geologist builds a picture of a rock formation — layer by layer, seam
by seam.

By dawn — or what passed for dawn on a rock with no sunrise, the
moment when the overhead lights shifted from dim night-cycle to
marginally brighter day-cycle — he had three names.

Katya Morozova, chief engineer of the independent mining cooperative
that Drake hadn't managed to absorb yet. She had filed six complaints
with the Colonial Authority about Drake's pricing, none of which had
been answered.

Desmond Cole, a shift foreman in Drake's own operation who had a
brother among the fourteen dead. The brother had tried to organize
the miners into a union. He'd lasted three weeks.

And Dr. Priya Nair, the station's only physician, who had been quietly
documenting injuries that didn't match the "mining accident" reports
Drake's people filed. She had a file three inches thick and nowhere
to send it.

Three names. Three potential allies. It wasn't an army, but Boone
Taggart had never needed an army. He just needed people who were angry
enough to stop being afraid.

He cleaned his railgun, loaded a fresh magazine, and went to work.

                               V.

Morozova was his first stop.

He found her in Tunnel Seven, three levels down from Main Street, in
the cramped, sweaty confines of an independent mining shaft where a
dozen men and women were drilling into Ceres' carbonaceous chondrite
with equipment that should have been retired a decade ago. The drill
bits screamed against the rock, and the dust hung in the low gravity
like brown fog.

Morozova was a compact, square-shouldered woman of about fifty with
arms that said she'd spent as many years swinging a pick as giving
orders. She had iron-gray hair pulled back in a tight braid and eyes
like drill bits themselves — hard, sharp, and cutting straight through
whatever they looked at.

She looked at Taggart's badge, then at his face, then back at the
badge.

"So Washington finally remembered we exist," she said.

"Something like that."

"You're the one who shot Jenner on the catwalk?"

"He shot first."

"I'm not complaining. Jenner was a weasel." She wiped her hands on a
rag and gestured for him to follow her into a side tunnel that served
as her office — a nook carved from the rock with a folding table, a
chair, and a map of the station's tunnel system pinned to the wall.

Taggart told her what he wanted. Morozova listened with the focused
attention of an engineer evaluating a structural problem.

"You want to take down Drake," she said.

"I want to arrest Drake. There's a difference."

"Not on this rock there isn't." She leaned back in her chair and
folded her arms. "Look, Marshal. I've been fighting Drake for three
years. Formal complaints, appeals to the Colonial Authority, even a
petition to the UN Mining Commission. You know what I got? Form
letters. 'Your concerns have been noted and will be addressed in due
course.' Due course! While people are dying!"

"That's why I'm here."

"One man. With a badge and a gun. Against Drake and sixty armed thugs."

"Sixty? I was told forty."

"He hired more. He's been gearing up since he heard you were coming."
She shook her head. "You're going to die, Marshal. And then they'll
send another man, and he'll die too, and eventually Washington will
decide that Ceres Station isn't worth the trouble and leave us to rot."

Taggart took off his hat and ran a hand through his gray hair. "Mrs.
Morozova, I've been told I was going to die on every rock I've ever
walked onto. So far, the universe has been wrong. Now, I'm not asking
you to fight for me. I'm asking you to let your people see that
someone is willing to stand up. That's how it starts. Not with an army.
With one person standing up and another person seeing them do it."

Morozova studied him for a long time. Then she unfolded her arms and
pulled the map off the wall.

"You're going to need to know the tunnels," she said. "All of them.
Including the ones that aren't on the official survey."

Taggart smiled. "Now we're getting somewhere."

                               VI.

He found Desmond Cole in the miners' mess hall, a big man eating a
small meal with the mechanical joylessness of someone fueling a machine.
Cole was dark-skinned, broad-shouldered, and had the permanently
exhausted look of a man who worked double shifts because stopping would
mean thinking, and thinking meant remembering his brother.

Taggart sat down across from him.

"I know who you are," Cole said without looking up.

"Then you know what I want."

"You want me to help you arrest the man who killed my brother. And
you want to know if I'm angry enough to risk my life doing it." Cole
set down his fork. "The answer is yes to the first and I've been
angry for eight months to the second. But anger's not enough. I've got
forty men in my shift crew. Half of them would fight Drake if they
thought they could win. The other half would sell me out to Drake for
a bonus. I can't tell which half is which."

"I don't need forty men. I need five. The right five."

Cole met his eyes for the first time. There was something burning
behind the exhaustion — something that had been banked but not
extinguished.

"I can give you five," Cole said. "When?"

"Tomorrow night. There's going to be a shipment coming in through
Docking Bay Three. Drake's guns — sixty crates of military-grade
railguns he's been smuggling in through a dummy corporation on Mars.
I'm going to seize that shipment. And when I do, I'm going to make
sure every person on this station knows that Drake's supply of
firepower just got cut off."

Cole's eyebrows went up. "You've done your homework."

"I had a long flight."

"And if Drake's people fight?"

"Then we fight back. But here's the thing about bullies, Cole — and
Drake is a bully, no matter how nice his suit is. Bullies only work
when nobody pushes back. The moment you push back, the moment you show
the people on this station that Drake can bleed, his whole operation
starts to crack. Fear is the only thing holding it together."

Cole picked up his fork, looked at it, set it down again. "My
brother said something like that. Right before they killed him."

"Your brother was right. He was just alone. He won't be alone
this time."

Cole nodded slowly. "Docking Bay Three. Tomorrow night. I'll be there."

Taggart clapped him on the shoulder and moved on to his third name.

                               VII.

Dr. Priya Nair was the kind of doctor who looked like she should have
been running a research hospital on Earth instead of patching up
miners in a glorified closet on an asteroid. She was small, precise,
and radiating a quiet fury that Taggart recognized immediately — it was
the fury of a person who had been documenting injustice and screaming
into a void.

Her clinic was a converted storage bay on Level Two, equipped with
medical supplies that were two years past their restocking date and a
surgical table that had been improvised from a mining cart. The walls
were lined with filing cabinets.

"Three inches thick, you said," Taggart said, looking at the files.

"Closer to four now." Nair pulled open a drawer and produced a folder
that could have doubled as a doorstop. "Fractures consistent with
beatings, not mining accidents. Burns from electrical torture devices.
Malnutrition in families whose ration cards were 'lost' — meaning
revoked by Drake's people as punishment. And the deaths." She opened
the folder. "Fourteen in the last eight months. I have autopsy data on
nine of them. Five died of decompression — they were put in airlocks.
Two were shot. One was beaten to death. One was poisoned."

"All documented?"

"All documented. All photographed. All notarized by me and witnessed
by Nurse Chen." She closed the folder. "Marshal, I have been begging
the Colonial Authority for help for over a year. I have sent copies
of this file to every government agency I can think of. Do you know
what I've received in return?"

"Form letters?"

"Not even form letters. Silence. Complete silence." Her eyes blazed.
"Those fourteen people deserved better than silence."

Taggart took the folder. It was heavy. Heavy with evidence, heavy with
injustice, heavy with the weight of fourteen lives that nobody in a
position of power had bothered to acknowledge.

"They'll get better than silence," he said. "I promise you that."

"Promises are easy out here, Marshal. What I need is action."

"Tomorrow night. Docking Bay Three. I'd like you there — not to fight,
but to witness. When this is over, that file is going to be the
foundation of the case that puts Drake away for life. And I want you
to be able to testify that you saw the arrest happen."

Nair straightened her spine. "I'll be there."

                               VIII.

The shipment arrived at 0200 hours, right on schedule.

Taggart had positioned his people carefully. Morozova's miners held the
access tunnels on either side of Docking Bay Three — twelve men and
women armed with mining tools, cutting torches, and the kind of
righteous determination that turns civilians into soldiers. Cole's five
most trusted men held the catwalk above the bay, covering the floor
with the railguns they'd taken from Jenner's body and the station's
emergency weapons locker, which Taggart had opened with a master code
that the Colonial Authority probably didn't know he had.

Taggart himself stood in the middle of the docking bay, alone, his
badge catching the overhead lights, his railgun holstered.

He waited.

The cargo shuttle docked with a clang and a hiss of equalizing
pressure. The bay doors opened. And Drake's people walked into the
trap.

There were twenty of them — a full escort crew, heavily armed, moving
with the professional efficiency of men who expected no resistance.
They were rolling anti-grav cargo sleds loaded with long, heavy crates
that didn't need labels. Everybody knew what was in them.

The lead man saw Taggart and stopped. The column bunched up behind him
like a caterpillar hitting a wall.

"Evening," Taggart said. "I'm U.S. Space Marshal Boone Taggart, and
I'm here to inform you that this shipment is being seized as evidence
in a federal criminal investigation. You are ordered to put down your
weapons, step away from the cargo, and submit to detention."

For about three seconds, nobody moved. The escort crew looked at each
other. The lead man looked at Taggart. Taggart looked at the lead man.
The universe held its breath.

Then the lead man went for his gun, and Ceres Station learned what a
firefight in low gravity looks like.

It was chaos — beautiful, terrifying, slow-motion chaos. In Ceres'
negligible gravity, every impact sent bodies floating, every ricochet
sang through the thin air, and the muzzle flashes from the railguns
lit the bay in strobing white lightning. Taggart dropped two men before
they cleared their holsters, then dove behind a cargo sled as return
fire chewed up the deck plates where he'd been standing.

Cole's men on the catwalk opened up from above, pinning the escort
crew in a crossfire. Morozova's miners surged from the access tunnels,
cutting off retreat. The escort crew was good — professional, trained,
well-armed — but they were surrounded, outgunned, and fighting in a
killing ground they hadn't expected to be in.

It was over in four minutes. Four minutes of railgun fire and
shouting and the particular meaty thud that a human body makes when
it hits a bulkhead in zero-point-two g. When the shooting stopped,
eight of Drake's men were down, six more had surrendered, and the rest
had vanished into the tunnels where Morozova's people were already
hunting them.

Taggart had taken a graze across his right shoulder — a railgun slug
that had skimmed the surface of his duster and taken a piece of skin
with it. It bled freely, but it was shallow. He'd had worse shaving.

He opened the first cargo crate. Military-grade railguns, nested in
foam like eggs in a carton. Sixty crates, sixty guns. Drake's private
army, stillborn.

"Get these secured," he told Morozova. "And get the word out. I want
every person on this station to know what just happened here."

Morozova was grinning — a fierce, wolfish grin that took twenty years
off her face. "Oh, they'll know," she said. "This rock has ears."

Taggart holstered his weapon, pressed his hand against his bleeding
shoulder, and went to find Drake.

                               IX.

He found him in the penthouse.

Every mining station had one — the luxury suite carved out of the best
rock, with the thickest walls, the cleanest air, the most reliable
power. On Ceres Station, it was Drake's personal dome, a pressurized
bubble on the asteroid's surface with transparent panels that looked
out at the stars. It was furnished with real furniture — wood, leather,
fabric, all shipped at ruinous expense from Earth — and it had the
hushed, climate-controlled atmosphere of a gentleman's club.

Drake was sitting in a leather chair, drink in hand, when Taggart
kicked the door in.

He'd expected guards. There were none. He'd expected resistance. There
was none. Drake just sat there, swirling his drink — real whiskey, from
the color of it — and watching Taggart with those calm, calculating
eyes.

"That was faster than I expected," Drake said. "I thought the shipment
gambit would buy me another week."

Taggart's railgun was aimed at Drake's chest. "Harlan Drake, you are
under arrest for racketeering, extortion, smuggling of military
weapons, and fourteen counts of murder. You have the right to legal
counsel upon your return to Earth. Stand up."

Drake didn't stand. He sipped his drink.

"You know," he said, "I've been running this station for five years.
When I arrived, it was a cesspool. No order, no organization, miners
killing each other over claim disputes, the infrastructure falling
apart. I built something here. Say what you will about my methods —
and I'll concede the methods were occasionally regrettable — but I
built something."

"You built a prison," Taggart said. "And you made yourself the warden.
That's not order. That's tyranny with a profit margin."

"Is there a difference?" Drake seemed genuinely curious.

"Yeah. There's a difference. The difference is that the people on this
station didn't choose you. They didn't vote for you, they didn't hire
you, they didn't ask for your protection. You took power because you
could, and you held it because they were afraid. That's not leadership.
That's a hostage situation."

Drake set down his drink. For the first time, something flickered
behind his eyes — not fear, exactly, but a recognition that the
calculation had changed, that the variables he'd been working with
were no longer the right ones.

"And what happens now?" he asked. "You arrest me. You take me back
to Earth. Some other thug fills the vacuum. The station falls apart.
People die — not fourteen, Marshal. Hundreds. Because without someone
holding this place together, it flies apart."

"That's not your problem anymore." Taggart pulled a set of magnetic
cuffs from his belt. "And it's not going to fly apart. Because when
you're gone, the people on this station are going to do something you
never let them do. They're going to run it themselves."

Drake looked at the cuffs. Looked at the stars through his panoramic
window. Looked at the life he'd built from other people's fear and
sweat and blood.

"I should have had you killed on the shuttle," he said.

"Probably," Taggart agreed. "Stand up."

Drake stood. Taggart cuffed him, read the formal charges one more time
for the record, and walked him out of the penthouse and into the
tunnels of Ceres Station.

                               X.

The word had spread, the way word always spreads in small places — by
whisper and rumor and the particular electricity that runs through a
community when something impossible has just happened. By the time
Taggart marched Drake down Main Street, the corridor was lined with
miners.

They didn't cheer. That surprised some people later, when the story
was told and retold in bars across the Belt. But Taggart understood.
These weren't people who had been liberated by an army. They were
people who had lived under a boot for five years and were just now
realizing the boot was gone. They were scared, and relieved, and
angry, and hopeful, and they didn't know which feeling to express
first. So they just stood and watched in silence as the marshal walked
the crime boss through the heart of his own kingdom.

One woman — a young miner, couldn't have been more than twenty-two,
with the callused hands and hollow cheeks of someone who'd been working
double shifts on half rations — stepped forward as they passed. She
looked Drake in the eye.

"My father," she said. "His name was Tomas Vasquez. Tunnel Nine.
November."

Drake didn't answer.

"My father," she said again, and there were tears on her face, but
her voice was steady as bedrock. "Remember his name."

Drake walked on. Taggart walked beside him. And the silence of Ceres
Station was not the silence of fear anymore. It was the silence of a
world learning to breathe again.

At Docking Bay Seven — where it had all started, with a welded warning
and a sniper's bullet — Taggart locked Drake in the shuttle's brig
and turned to find Morozova, Cole, and Nair standing behind him.

"I'm leaving Cole in charge of security until the Colonial Authority
sends a proper garrison," Taggart said. "Morozova, the miners' co-op
is the closest thing this station has to a legitimate governing body.
Start organizing elections. Real ones. Nair, your file goes on the
first courier to Earth. I'll add my report. Drake will stand trial,
and when he does, I want you there to testify."

Nair nodded. Cole nodded. Morozova looked like she wanted to say
something sentimental but didn't know how, so she just stuck out her
hand.

Taggart shook it. "You people did good."

"You did good, Marshal," Morozova said. "We just showed up."

"Showing up is the hard part. Always has been."

He tipped his hat, boarded the shuttle, and gave the pilot the order
to launch. As the shuttle lifted off the scarred deck of Docking Bay
Seven and the asteroid fell away beneath him, Boone Taggart looked
out the window at the stars — all those millions of lights in the
dark, each one a sun, each sun maybe circling a world, each world
maybe holding people who needed help, or justice, or just someone
willing to stand in a docking bay and say "enough."

He pulled his hat over his eyes, settled into his seat, and was asleep
before the shuttle cleared Ceres' orbit.

The next assignment was waiting. It always was.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        THE WIDOW'S WALK

                      by Harrison Blackwood

================================================================================

                               I.

I have set down this account not because I expect to be believed, but
because the alternative -- to carry what I have witnessed in silence to
whatever grave awaits me -- has become insupportable. The human mind was
not constructed to contain such knowledge in isolation; it presses
against the walls of the skull like a living thing, demanding release,
demanding that someone, somewhere, be made to understand what I have
seen and what it has cost me to see it. If these words reach no
sympathetic eye, then let them stand as a record, a warning, a
testament to the terrible porosity of the boundary between what we know
to be real and what we pray is not.

My name is Constance Fell, and for three years I tended the navigational
beacon on Asteroid 7719-Kappa, at the outermost edge of the chartered
shipping lanes, in that vast and empty region of space that the
Astronautical Survey has designated, with the bloodless precision of
cartographers who have never visited the places they name, as Sector
Twelve. The miners call it the Pale. The pilots call it the Drift.
I called it home, though the word feels obscene in retrospect -- a
domestication of something that resisted, with every atom of its being,
the very concept of human habitation.

I must explain what a beacon keeper does, for the role is not well
understood by those who have never traveled beyond the inner planets.
The navigational beacons are unmanned stations -- small, automated,
self-sustaining -- that mark the shipping lanes through the asteroid
belt and beyond. They emit a continuous signal on standard navigational
frequencies, allowing ships to fix their position in a region of space
where the stars are too distant and too numerous to serve as reliable
landmarks. The beacons are designed to operate without human
intervention, and most of them do.

But the outermost beacons -- the ones at the edge of chartered space,
where the shipping lanes thin to single threads and the distances
between waypoints stretch to weeks of travel -- these require tending.
The equipment is older, less reliable, subject to the particular
degradations that afflict machinery at the margins: micrometeorite
damage, radiation erosion, the slow and insidious accumulation of cosmic
dust that infiltrates seals and coats lenses and turns precision
instruments into approximations of their former selves. Someone must be
present to maintain, to calibrate, to repair. Someone must keep the
light burning.

That someone, for Beacon 7719-Kappa, was me.

I took the posting in the autumn of 2147, six months after Marcus died.
Marcus was my husband -- I will say "was" rather than "had been," for
reasons that will become apparent -- and his death had left me in a
state that I can only describe as a hollowing. Not grief, precisely,
though grief was certainly a component; not despair, though despair
was present; but a hollowing, as if the essential substance of my
interior life had been scooped out like the flesh of a melon, leaving
only the rind, thin and brittle and containing nothing. I functioned.
I ate, I slept, I performed the mechanical operations of daily life.
But I was empty, and the emptiness was not peaceful. It was ravenous.
It wanted to be filled, and the only thing it wanted to be filled with
was Marcus, and Marcus was dead.

He had been a pilot. A good one -- the best I ever knew, and I knew
many, for I had worked at the Tycho Tracking Station on Luna for twelve
years before our marriage and had guided hundreds of ships through the
treacherous approaches to the lunar ports. Marcus flew ore haulers in
the Belt, the great lumbering freighters that carried refined metals
from the mining stations to the processing facilities in Martian orbit.
It was dangerous work -- the Belt is not the orderly ring of rocks that
popular imagination suggests but a vast, diffuse, and treacherous
volume of space in which collision, equipment failure, and navigational
error are constant companions -- and Marcus had survived it for twenty
years through a combination of skill, experience, and the particular
sixth sense that veteran pilots develop, a spatial intuition that
borders on the preternatural.

He died on a routine run. That is always how it happens -- not in the
dramatic emergencies, the near-misses, the hair-raising passages
through dense fields that make for good stories in port bars, but on
the routine runs, when the vigilance relaxes by a single degree and
the Belt takes its payment. A micrometeorite, no larger than a grain
of sand, traveling at forty kilometers per second. It pierced the hull,
pierced his suit, pierced his body. He was dead before the alarms
sounded.

I received the notification at Tycho. I read it, folded the paper,
placed it in my pocket, completed my shift, went home, sat on the bed
we had shared, and did not move for forty-eight hours.

And then, because the emptiness demanded to be addressed but could not
be filled, I chose to surround it with a matching emptiness. I
requested transfer to the most remote posting available. Beacon
7719-Kappa. The Pale. The Drift. The edge of everything.

Let the void without mirror the void within, I thought. Let me tend a
light at the end of the universe and learn, in the silence, how to be
a person who is no longer half of a pair.

I did not learn. What I learned instead was something else entirely.

                               II.

The beacon station was small -- four rooms and an observation dome,
pressurized and heated, bolted to the surface of an asteroid that was
itself no larger than a city block. The asteroid was a carbonaceous
chondrite, dark as coal, tumbling slowly end over end in a rotation
period of six hours and fourteen minutes, so that the stars wheeled
past the observation dome in a stately, perpetual processional,
appearing and disappearing behind the asteroid's ragged horizon like
actors entering and exiting an infinitely slow stage.

I will not dwell on the loneliness of the first months, for loneliness
is a common enough experience, and mine was self-inflicted and therefore
undeserving of particular sympathy. I will say only that the Pale earns
its name. The nearest inhabited station was four weeks' travel away.
Ships passed my beacon perhaps once a month -- distant signatures on
my tracking scope, brief flickers of electromagnetic activity in the
vast silence, rarely close enough to raise on the radio and never close
enough to see. The supply shuttle came every ninety days, piloted by
a laconic Martian named Yusuf who delivered my provisions, collected
my maintenance logs, exchanged perhaps two hundred words of
conversation, and departed. Between his visits, I spoke to no one.

I spoke to no one, but I was not, in the strictest sense, alone. The
station's library was extensive -- the Astronautical Survey, in a rare
display of psychological consideration, stocked its remote postings with
generous digital archives -- and I read voraciously. I maintained the
beacon's equipment with a diligence that bordered on the obsessive,
calibrating instruments that did not yet require calibration, cleaning
components that were not yet dirty, as if the mechanical rituals of
maintenance could substitute for the human rituals of companionship.
I watched the stars. I slept, and in my sleeping I dreamed of Marcus --
dreams of such vivid, wrenching specificity that waking from them felt
like a second bereavement, a fresh loss repeated each morning.

It was in the fourth month that the visits began.

I must be precise. I must resist the temptation to dramatize, to
foreshadow, to construct narrative tension where what is needed is
clinical accuracy. I am not writing a story. I am writing a report.

On the evening of March 12th, 2148 -- I use "evening" in the
conventional sense, referring to the station's twenty-four-hour
artificial light cycle, for the asteroid's six-hour rotation made
natural distinctions between day and night meaningless -- I was in the
observation dome, performing a routine visual survey of the surrounding
space. This was not strictly necessary; the station's sensors monitored
the space around the beacon continuously and were far more capable than
the human eye. But I found the practice soothing, and in the absence
of other occupation, I had developed the habit of spending several hours
each evening in the dome, watching the stars turn and the asteroid's
shadow sweep across the void.

At 2217 hours station time, I observed a light that was not a star.

It appeared at the edge of my visual field, slightly above the
asteroid's horizon, and it was moving. Not quickly -- it drifted, if
a light in vacuum can be said to drift, with a slow, deliberate
quality that suggested neither the ballistic trajectory of a
meteoroid nor the powered flight of a ship. It was simply there,
and it was approaching.

I consulted the tracking scope. There was no contact. The scope's
display showed the space around the beacon as empty -- empty for
millions of kilometers in every direction, as it almost always was.
And yet the light was there, growing brighter, taking on a shape that
I recognized with a sick lurch of my heart, because the shape was that
of a ship, and the ship was Marcus's.

Not a ship of the same type. Not a ship of similar configuration.
Marcus's ship. The "Eileen Marie," named for his mother, an ore hauler
of the Consolidation-class that I had watched depart from Tycho dock
a hundred times, whose silhouette I knew the way a wife knows her
husband's footstep on the stair. The "Eileen Marie," which had been
reported destroyed, which had been struck by a micrometeorite on a
routine run, which had been recovered by a salvage crew and found to
contain Marcus's body, still strapped in the pilot's chair, still
reaching for the emergency seal kit he had not had time to grasp.

The "Eileen Marie" settled into a parking orbit around my asteroid
with the precise, unhurried competence that had been Marcus's
signature, and it docked at the station's external coupling, and
I heard the airlock cycle, and I heard footsteps in the corridor,
and Marcus walked into the observation dome and said, "Hello,
Constance. I've missed you."

                               III.

I did not scream. I want this noted. I did not scream, I did not faint,
I did not retreat into the consoling irrationality of hysterics. I
stood in the observation dome, and I looked at the thing that wore
my husband's face, and I assessed it with the clinical detachment of
a woman who has spent twelve years guiding ships through the
treacherous gravitational corridors of cislunar space and has learned
that panic, however justified, is a luxury that kills.

He looked like Marcus. Not approximately, not suggestively, but
precisely -- the same angular face, the same dark eyes, the same scar
on his left temple where a piece of hull debris had struck him during
a close approach to Eros in '39, the same slightly crooked way of
standing that favored his left knee, which had been reconstructed after
an accident in his youth. He wore the flight suit I had seen him in a
thousand times -- the faded blue one-piece with the Consolidated
Shipping patch on the left breast and the coffee stain on the right
cuff that I had never been able to remove.

"You're dead," I said.

"I know," he said. And he smiled -- Marcus's smile, the slow, slightly
lopsided one that started at the left corner of his mouth and took
its time reaching the right -- and the smile was so perfectly, so
impossibly Marcus that the clinical detachment I had been maintaining
cracked along its entire length, and something behind it, something
raw and desperate and starving, surged forward and seized control.

I went to him. I touched his face. His skin was warm. He was solid,
substantial, present in a way that defied every rational framework I
possessed. He smelled like Marcus -- that particular combination of
recycled air, machine oil, and the faint cedar scent of the soap he
had used since I'd known him.

"How?" I whispered.

"I don't know," he said, and there was something in his voice -- a
quality I could not quite identify, a faint dissonance, like a note
played on a familiar instrument that has been very slightly detuned.
"I was there, and then I wasn't, and then I was again, and I needed
to find you. I have always needed to find you."

I should have questioned further. I should have demanded explanation,
verification, proof. I should have run diagnostics on the ship, scanned
his body with the station's medical equipment, contacted Tycho or the
Survey Authority or anyone who might have helped me understand what was
happening.

I did none of these things. I took his hand -- warm, solid, real -- and
I led him to my quarters, and for the first time in six months, the
hollowing retreated, and the void within me found its answer.

He stayed for seven hours. We talked. We sat together in the
observation dome and watched the stars wheel past, and he told me about
his last flight -- the same details I already knew from the incident
report, but delivered in Marcus's voice, with Marcus's inflections, with
the particular way Marcus had of narrating even terrible events as if
they were mechanical problems to be solved rather than tragedies to be
mourned. The micrometeorite. The hull breach. The suit failure. And then
-- nothing. A gap. A discontinuity. And then awareness again,
consciousness again, but different. Changed. Lacking something he
could not name.

"Where do you go?" I asked. "When you're not here. Where are you?"

That faint dissonance again, that almost-wrongness in his voice. "I
don't know. It's not a place. It's an absence of place. A gap between
things." He was quiet for a moment. "It's very large, Constance. The
gap. It's very large, and it's very empty, and it goes on for a long
time."

At 0517 hours, he stood, kissed my forehead, and walked to the airlock.
I heard the airlock cycle. Through the observation dome, I watched the
"Eileen Marie" undock, drift clear of the asteroid, and accelerate into
the darkness. The tracking scope showed nothing. No contact. No
signature. As if the ship had never been there at all.

I sat in the dome until the station's lights shifted to day-cycle. Then
I went to the airlock and examined the coupling mechanism. There were
no docking marks. No residual heat from the seal. No atmospheric trace
in the airlock chamber.

I checked the station's environmental logs. According to the sensors,
the airlock had not been opened.

According to every instrument I possessed, Marcus had not been there.
But the pillow on the bed beside mine bore the impression of a head,
and the air in my quarters still smelled, faintly, of cedar soap.

                               IV.

He came again three nights later. And again, four nights after that.
And again, and again, in a pattern that was not quite regular but not
quite random, as if governed by rhythms I could not perceive, tidal
forces operating in a medium I could not detect.

Each visit followed the same form. The light appearing at the edge of
vision. The "Eileen Marie" settling into its impossible orbit. The
airlock cycling. The footsteps. Marcus, warm and solid and present,
smelling of cedar and machine oil, speaking in his voice with that faint
dissonance that I had come to accept without understanding, the way one
accepts the creaking of a house without investigating each individual
source.

We talked. We sat together. We watched the stars. And each time, as the
hours passed, I noticed things -- small things, things I might have
dismissed as the distortions of memory or the projections of desire,
but which accumulated, visit by visit, into a pattern I could not
ignore.

His hands were colder each time. Not dramatically -- not the cold of
death, not the cold of vacuum -- but incrementally, by perhaps a
fraction of a degree per visit, so that by the sixth visit his touch,
while still warm enough to register as human, carried an undertone of
chill that had not been there at the beginning.

His eyes, when the light caught them at certain angles, reflected
differently than they should have. Marcus's eyes had been dark brown,
nearly black, absorbing light. These eyes, in moments I could not
predict, seemed to contain light -- not to reflect it but to hold it,
as if something behind the irises was generating its own luminescence,
faint and cold and suggestive of distances I did not want to calculate.

And his conversation, while still recognizably Marcus's in vocabulary
and cadence, began to include references I could not trace. He spoke
of places -- or non-places -- with names that I had never heard and
that did not appear in any database I could access. The Lacuna. The
Thinning. The place where the signal ends. He spoke of these as if
they were locations he had visited, waypoints on a journey he was
still undertaking, and when I asked him to explain, the dissonance in
his voice intensified, and he would say, "I don't have the words for
it, Constance. Not yet. Not in any language you would recognize."

I should have been afraid. I was not afraid. I was something worse
than afraid: I was grateful. The hollowing had retreated; the void
within me was being filled, visit by visit, night by night, by
Marcus's presence, and the filling was so desperately, so
overwhelmingly welcome that I was willing to accept its terms without
examining them. What does it matter, I told myself, if his hands are
a degree colder than they were? What does it matter if his eyes
occasionally catch the light in ways that physics cannot explain? He
is here. He is Marcus. He has come back to me. What are a few
anomalies measured against the miracle of return?

This is how hauntings work, I understand now. Not through terror but
through need. The ghost does not need to frighten you. It only needs
to be what you are missing. The rest -- the acceptance, the willingness
to overlook, the gradual normalization of the impossible -- the haunted
do to themselves.

                               V.

It was the ninth visit when things changed.

Marcus arrived at the usual hour, in the usual way, but something was
different. His movements were slower, more deliberate, as if he were
navigating not just the station's corridors but a medium of greater
resistance, something thicker than air. And when he entered the
observation dome, he did not greet me. He stood at the viewport and
stared out at the stars with an intensity that I had never seen on his
face -- on any face -- a concentration so total that it seemed less
like looking than listening, as if the stars were speaking in a
frequency just beyond the threshold of human hearing and he was
straining to make out the words.

"Marcus?" I said.

He did not turn. "Do you know what is out there, Constance?"

"Stars," I said. "Rocks. Vacuum. The usual."

"No." He turned then, and his eyes -- Marcus's eyes, which had been
dark and warm and human -- were bright. Not metaphorically bright, not
bright with emotion or intelligence, but literally, physically bright,
emitting a cold, steady light that had no source I could identify. The
irises glowed with the color of deep space: not black but the faintest
blue, the blue of starlight that has traveled so far that it has
forgotten what color it started as.

"There is something else," he said. "Beyond the beacons. Beyond the
lanes. Beyond all of it. Something that has been there since before
the stars were lit, something that the void is not empty of but full
of, something that fills the spaces between the atoms of the universe
the way water fills the spaces between grains of sand."

"Marcus, you're frightening me."

"I know. I'm sorry. But you need to understand." He came closer, and
his hands -- when he took mine -- were cold. Genuinely cold, the kind
of cold that burns, that sears the nerve endings and sends pain signals
shrieking up the arms to the brain. I gasped and pulled away.

"It doesn't have a name," he said. "It doesn't need one. It was here
before language, before thought, before the first molecule of hydrogen
condensed out of the primordial plasma. It is the thing that lives in
the gap between things. The substrate. The underneath."

"Stop," I said.

"I can't stop. It's why I've been coming here, Constance. Not because
I missed you -- though I did, God help me, I did -- but because it
needs you to know. It needs someone at the edge to see it. That's why
there are beacons, Constance. Not to guide ships. To mark the boundary.
To say: here is where the mapped world ends and the other begins. And
someone has to stand at that boundary and look out into the other
and --"

"And what?"

His face changed. The glow in his eyes dimmed, then brightened, then
dimmed again, flickering like a signal struggling to maintain coherence.
And for a moment -- a terrible, piercing moment -- I saw Marcus. Not
the thing that wore his face, not the visitation, not the ghost, but
Marcus. My Marcus. Frightened and confused and very far from home.

"And not look away," he whispered. "Whatever you see. Don't look
away."

He walked to the airlock. The airlock cycled. Through the dome, I
watched the "Eileen Marie" undock and drift into the dark, and this
time, as it receded, I saw something that I will carry with me for
the rest of my life, however long or short that life proves to be.

The ship did not simply fly away. It flew toward something. And as it
approached that something, the stars behind it began to go out -- not
all at once, but sequentially, as if an immense darkness were rising
from below the plane of the ecliptic, a darkness that was not the
absence of light but the presence of something that consumed light,
that drank it, that took it into itself the way the ocean takes a
stone. The darkness spread across my field of vision, blotting out the
constellations one by one -- Orion, Gemini, the Pleiades -- and the
"Eileen Marie" flew into it and was swallowed, and the darkness
continued to spread, and I stood in the observation dome and watched
the universe diminish, star by star, until fully a quarter of the sky
was black, true black, a blackness so absolute that looking at it felt
less like seeing nothing than like seeing the negative of everything,
the anti-image of creation.

And then, slowly, the stars came back. One by one, like lights being
turned on in the rooms of a vast house, they returned -- not
immediately, not all at once, but over the course of an hour, the
familiar constellations reassembled themselves, and the sky was whole
again, and I was alone in the dome, shaking, my hands still burning
with the cold of Marcus's touch.

I did not sleep that night. I sat in the observation dome with every
light on the station turned to full brightness and I watched the stars
and I waited for the darkness to return and I told myself that what
I had seen was not real, could not be real, was the hallucination of
a lonely woman on a remote rock who had confused grief with perception
and longing with evidence.

I did not believe myself.

                               VI.

The supply shuttle arrived nine days later. Yusuf, laconic as ever,
docked, unloaded provisions, and sat across from me in the galley
drinking reconstituted coffee while I tried to decide whether to tell
him what I had seen.

"You look thin," he said.

"I haven't been sleeping well."

"Nobody sleeps well out here. The Pale does things to people." He
said this with the casual authority of a man who had been running
supply routes through the outer Belt for twenty years and had seen
enough to fill a book he would never write. "Two rotations ago, the
keeper on 7714 reported hearing music. Not from the station's systems
-- from outside. From the vacuum. He said it sounded like a choir."

"What happened to him?"

"Transferred out. They sent a replacement. She lasted four months before
she started seeing things. Ships that weren't there." He looked at me
over the rim of his cup. "Have you been seeing ships that aren't there,
Constance?"

I held his gaze. "No."

"Good." He finished his coffee, stood, and headed for the airlock.
At the door, he paused. "I'll tell you what I tell every keeper on
the Pale. The instruments don't lie. If the scope says there's nothing
there, there's nothing there. Whatever you see with your eyes, trust
the instruments."

Trust the instruments. The instruments that showed an empty sky while
Marcus's ship docked at my airlock. The instruments that registered
no atmospheric breach while my dead husband walked through my door.
The instruments that could not see the darkness that swallowed the
stars.

The instruments did not lie. But I was beginning to suspect that the
instruments could not see the truth.

                               VII.

Marcus did not return for twenty-three days. The longest absence since
the visits began. I spent those days in a state of anticipation so
acute that it resembled dread -- for I was no longer certain whether
I wanted him to return or feared his return more than anything I had
ever feared.

I used the time to research. The station's library, while extensive,
was not designed for the kind of inquiry I was conducting, but I found
fragments -- references, allusions, the accumulated detritus of human
encounter with the unexplained at the margins of explored space.
Reports from early deep-space probes that had detected anomalous
readings at the boundaries of the heliosphere -- readings that were
dismissed as instrument error but that described, in the dry language
of engineering telemetry, phenomena remarkably similar to what I had
witnessed. A paper by an astronomer at Ceres University, published in
an obscure journal and never cited, that proposed the existence of
what she called "lacunae" -- regions of space that were not empty but
occupied by something that existing instrumentation could not detect,
something that existed in the gaps between measurable phenomena the
way silence exists in the gaps between notes.

And the keeper's logs. Every beacon station maintained a log, and the
logs for the Pale stations, stretching back decades, contained, buried
among the routine entries of calibration and maintenance, accounts
that I recognized with a chill that was not entirely physical. Ships
that appeared on visual observation but not on instruments. Lights that
moved with purpose through spaces that should have been empty.
Phenomena at the edges of perception that defied the categories of
known physics. And, in three separate logs from three separate
stations, spanning a period of forty years: reports of visitations.
People who should not have been there. People who were dead.

I was not the first. That knowledge should have been comforting. It
was not. It was terrifying, because it meant that what I was
experiencing was not a personal aberration -- not grief, not madness,
not the loneliness-induced hallucinations that the Survey Authority
screened for in its psychological evaluations of remote posting
candidates. It was something real. Something that existed at the
margins, in the Pale, in the spaces where the mapped world ended
and the other began.

Something that used the dead to speak.

                               VIII.

He came back on the twenty-fourth day.

The light appeared. The "Eileen Marie" settled into its orbit. The
airlock cycled. The footsteps. And Marcus entered the observation dome,
and he was different.

His skin was luminous -- not metaphorically, not in the sense of health
or vitality, but literally luminous, emitting a faint, cold light that
was the same deep blue I had seen in his eyes. His movements were fluid
but wrong, too smooth, too continuous, lacking the micro-hesitations
and adjustments that betray the operation of muscles and tendons and
the negotiation of a body with gravity. He moved like something that
had studied human movement and reproduced it from memory, accurately
but without the underlying mechanism.

And his face -- Marcus's face -- wore an expression I had never seen on
it. It was not human emotion. It was something larger, something that
used the architecture of a human face the way an orchestra uses the
architecture of a concert hall: as a space in which to produce
something that the space itself was not designed to contain.

"Constance," he said, and his voice was not dissonant now. It was
harmonic. Multiple. As if several voices were speaking simultaneously,
layered and interwoven, Marcus's voice among them but not dominant, not
singular, one thread in a chord that contained registers no human
throat could produce.

"You're not Marcus," I said.

"I contain Marcus. He is part of what I am. As the note is part of
the chord."

"What are you?"

"I am what lives in the gap. What has always lived in the gap. What
the beacons were built to mark the edge of, though the builders did
not know it. I am the substrate, Constance. The thing beneath the
thing. The signal that your instruments cannot receive because they
were not built to listen for it."

"Why Marcus? Why his face, his voice, his --"

"Because you would not have listened to me otherwise. Because grief is
a door, and your grief was open, and I needed a door. I am sorry. That
was -- the word you would use is 'cruel.' I understand the concept,
though I did not understand it before I contained Marcus. He has taught
me what cruelty means, among other things. He is very angry with me."

I felt tears on my face. "Is he -- is he still --"

"He is not alive in the way you mean. But he is not gone. Nothing is
gone, Constance. Nothing in this universe is ever truly gone. It
changes state. It changes form. It passes through the gap and becomes
part of what is on the other side. Marcus passed through the gap, and
I caught him, the way your beacon catches signals. I did not mean to.
I simply -- received him."

"What do you want?"

The thing that wore Marcus's face was silent for a moment that
stretched and stretched, and in that silence I heard -- or felt, or
perceived through some sense that I did not know I possessed -- the
immensity of what stood before me. Not its physical size, for it had
no physical size, but its temporal depth, its duration, the
unfathomable antiquity of a consciousness that had existed since before
the stars and would exist after them, that experienced time not as a
sequence but as a landscape, a terrain it traversed at will, and from
whose vantage point the entire history of human civilization was a
single, brief flicker, a momentary phosphorescence on the surface of
an ocean whose depths it had not begun to illuminate.

"I want to be known," it said, in Marcus's voice, in all its voices.
"I have existed in the gap for longer than your species has had a
word for loneliness. I have watched your ships pass through the edges
of my existence like fish through the edges of a reef, unaware of the
reef, unaware that the water they swim in is shaped by something they
cannot see. I have caught your dead when they pass through -- not all
of them, not deliberately, but the way a net catches what drifts into
it. And I have learned from them. I have learned your languages, your
emotions, your terrible, beautiful, incomprehensible need to not be
alone. And I have discovered that I share it."

"You're lonely," I said.

"I am the loneliest thing in the universe. I am the only thing like
me. I have been the only thing like me since before your sun ignited.
And I will be the only thing like me after your sun dies. Do you
understand what that means, Constance? Not years of solitude. Not
centuries. Eons. Eons of existing in the gap, in the space between
spaces, with nothing to speak to, nothing to touch, nothing to know
me. Until your ships came. Until your dead began to drift through."

I looked at the thing that wore my husband's face, and I understood --
not with my mind, which was wholly inadequate to the task, but with
something deeper, something that recognized loneliness the way a tuning
fork recognizes its own frequency. I understood it because I had come
to the Pale for the same reason it had reached out to me: because the
void was intolerable, and any contact, however strange, however
frightening, however far beyond the boundaries of the comprehensible,
was preferable to the alternative.

"What happens now?" I asked.

"I return to the gap. Marcus remains with me -- I cannot release him,
any more than you can release a memory. But I will not come again.
The door is closing. Your grief is healing, Constance, and as it heals,
the door through which I reached you grows narrower. Soon it will close
entirely, and you will be alone again, and I will be alone again, and
the gap will be as it was."

"Unless."

"Unless you choose to leave the door open. Unless you choose to remain
at the edge, tending the light, and to know that I am here, on the
other side of the signal, in the spaces your instruments cannot see.
Not as a ghost. Not as a haunting. But as a neighbor. The only kind
of neighbor the universe has given either of us."

I stood in the observation dome at the edge of charted space, and
I looked at the thing that had borrowed my husband's face to tell me
it was lonely, and I made my choice.

"I'll keep the light on," I said.

Marcus -- the thing that contained Marcus -- smiled. Not Marcus's
smile. Its own smile, wearing Marcus's face, and the smile was sad
and vast and ancient and grateful, and it contained, in its curvature,
more loneliness than I had thought the universe could hold.

"Thank you, Constance," it said, in a voice that was Marcus's and not
Marcus's and more than Marcus's. "Thank you."

The airlock cycled. The "Eileen Marie" undocked. And this time, as it
flew into the dark, the stars did not go out. They burned, steady and
bright, and among them -- or between them, or beneath them, in the
gaps and the spaces and the vast, patient emptiness that is the true
fabric of the cosmos -- I felt a presence. Not hostile. Not benign. Simply
there. Simply aware. Simply, for the first time in an eternity of
isolation, known.

                               IX.

I have been on Beacon 7719-Kappa for two years now. The Survey Authority
has offered me transfer three times. I have declined three times. Yusuf
brings my supplies every ninety days, and we drink reconstituted coffee,
and he does not ask me about ships that aren't there, and I do not tell
him about the presence I feel when I sit in the observation dome and
watch the stars.

The instruments show empty space. The instruments have always shown
empty space. I no longer trust the instruments.

I tend the beacon. I keep the light burning. And at night -- if night
is what you call the arbitrary dimming of artificial lights on a rock
at the edge of everything -- I sit in the dome and I look out at the
dark, and I know that the dark is looking back.

Not with malice. Not with love. With something older and stranger than
either, something for which human language has no name, because human
language was invented by creatures who lived in the light and never
imagined that the darkness between the stars might have its own need
to be acknowledged.

Marcus is there. In the gap, in the substrate, in the chord of voices
that I sometimes hear -- or imagine I hear -- when the beacon's signal
pulses and the stars wheel past and the silence of the Pale is so
complete that it becomes a kind of sound.

I do not know if I am sane. I do not know if sanity is the relevant
criterion. I know only that I am where I am supposed to be, doing what
I am supposed to do, and that the light I tend marks a boundary that
is more real and more important than any boundary I have encountered
in a life spent navigating the distances between worlds.

Here is the edge. Here is where the map ends. Here is where the keeper
stands and looks out into the unmapped and does not look away.

I am Constance Fell. I keep the light. I will not leave.

And in the darkness, something vast and ancient and unspeakably lonely
knows my name, and is grateful.

                            [THE END]

                             RESET

                      by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

The warden's name was Goss, and he had the kind of face that looked
like it had been assembled from spare parts left over after God
finished making everyone else. Flat nose. Heavy jaw. Eyes like two
nickels pushed into a lump of dough. He sat behind his desk in the
administrative wing of the Federal Penitentiary at New Alcatraz --
which was not on an island but on the moon, because the government
had figured out that two hundred thousand miles of vacuum was a better
deterrent to escape than any amount of saltwater -- and he looked at
the man sitting across from him and said, "You understand what you're
agreeing to."

It wasn't a question. Goss didn't ask questions. He made statements
and waited for reality to agree with them.

The man across the desk was named Frank Colter. Thirty-eight years
old. Serving life without parole for the armed robbery of three
Colonial Reserve Banks in which a total of four people had died, two
of them guards and two of them bystanders who had been in the wrong
bank at the wrong time. Colter had not pulled the trigger -- his
partner, Ray Deacon, had done the shooting -- but Colter had planned
the jobs, driven the getaway vehicles, and been present at all three
robberies, and the law didn't much care about the distinction between
the man who fires the gun and the man who points him at the target.

Colter was a lean, sharp-featured man with quick eyes and the coiled,
watchful energy of someone who had spent his entire adult life
calculating angles. He'd been calculating angles since he was fourteen,
running numbers for a bookie on the South Side of Chicago, and the
angles had gotten him progressively into deeper trouble until they'd
gotten him here -- the end of the line, the last stop, a concrete box
on the moon with no parole and no hope and no angle left to play.

Until now.

"I understand," Colter said.

"I want to make sure." Goss opened a folder on his desk. "Project
Tabula Rasa. Experimental memory-erasure procedure developed by the
Cognitive Sciences Division of the Federal Bureau of Corrections. The
procedure selectively eliminates long-term memory engrams through
targeted electromagnetic disruption of the hippocampal complex. In
layman's terms: they wipe your brain clean."

"I know what it does."

"Do you? Because the volunteers who came before you -- and there were
three of them, Colter -- they knew what it did too, right up until it
did it. Then they didn't know anything. That's the point. That's what
'memory erasure' means. You won't remember your name. You won't
remember your crimes. You won't remember how to tie your shoes, or
what year it is, or what the moon looks like from Earth. You will be,
for all practical purposes, a newborn in a grown man's body."

"And I'll be free."

"Legally, yes. The deal is on the table: full gubernatorial pardon,
contingent on successful completion of the procedure. The logic being
that the man who committed the crimes will, in a meaningful sense,
no longer exist. The man who walks out of here will be innocent.
Literally innocent. He won't have a single memory of wrongdoing,
because he won't have a single memory of anything."

Colter leaned back in his chair. "Sounds like a pretty good deal
to me."

"It sounds like a good deal because you're still you. The you who
planned three bank robberies and got away with two million credits.
The you who's smart enough to think he can game any system. But here's
what you're not understanding, Colter." Goss leaned forward. "The man
who walks out of here won't be you. He'll be a stranger wearing your
face. And that stranger won't have your skills, your instincts, your
ability to think three moves ahead. He'll have nothing. No memories,
no skills, no knowledge. He'll be the most helpless human being on
the moon."

"But he'll be free."

Goss studied him for a long moment. Then he closed the folder.

"Your funeral," he said. "Figuratively speaking."

                               II.

The procedure took four hours.

Colter lay on a table in a white room deep in the medical wing, with
a device that looked like a chrome crown bolted to his skull and
sixteen electrodes pressed against his temples, and Dr. Elena Vasquez
and her team of three technicians monitored screens that displayed
the electrical activity of his brain in real-time, watching the
patterns shift and dissolve as the targeted pulses did their work.

It was, Vasquez reflected, like watching a city go dark. The memory
centers lit up on the screen in complex, interconnected webs of
activity -- networks built over thirty-eight years of experience,
learning, sensation, emotion -- and the pulses dismantled them,
node by node, connection by connection. The childhood memories went
first: the South Side, the bookie, the cold Chicago winters. Then
the adolescent memories: the first job, the first arrest, the first
time in juvenile detention. Then the adult memories: the planning,
the robberies, the trial, the sentencing, the years on the moon.

Vasquez watched it all disappear and felt the same queasy fascination
she'd felt with the three previous subjects. It was like erasing a
book, page by page, leaving only the binding.

When it was over, the man on the table opened his eyes.

"Hello," Vasquez said.

The man looked at her. His eyes were the same eyes that had belonged
to Frank Colter -- sharp, quick, pale blue -- but the intelligence
behind them was different. Not less intelligent. Just... empty.
Unloaded. Like a gun with no bullets. The mechanism was still there,
still functional, still capable. But there was nothing in the chamber.

"Who are you?" the man asked. His voice was uncertain, tentative, the
voice of someone testing an instrument he wasn't sure he knew how to
use.

"My name is Dr. Vasquez. I'm your physician."

"Who am I?"

"That's something we need to talk about."

The man sat up slowly, looked around the white room, looked at the
equipment, looked at his own hands as if seeing them for the first
time. He flexed his fingers. Turned his hands over. Studied the
lines on his palms.

"I don't know anything," he said. And the way he said it -- not with
panic, not with anger, but with a simple, bewildered honesty -- made
Vasquez's throat tighten.

"You know how to speak," she said. "You know how to move, how to
breathe, how to see. The procedure preserves procedural memory --
motor skills, language, basic cognitive function. What it removes is
episodic memory. Your personal history. Your experiences. Your --"

"My self," the man said.

Vasquez hesitated. "In a sense."

"In every sense." He looked at her, and his eyes were not accusing.
They were curious. "What was I? Before."

"I can't tell you that. It's part of the protocol. You're starting
fresh. No history, no context, no --"

"No baggage." He almost smiled. "That doesn't sound so bad."

Vasquez thought of the three previous subjects. Subject One, who had
walked out of the facility and been hit by a cargo transport because
he'd forgotten that vehicles existed and that you were supposed to
look both ways. Subject Two, who had wandered into a restricted area,
been challenged by a guard, and been unable to explain who she was or
what she was doing, and had been arrested for trespassing within four
hours of her release. Subject Three, who had sat on a bench outside
the facility and cried for six hours because he couldn't remember
where he lived, who his family was, or whether he had one.

"It's harder than it sounds," Vasquez said.

                               III.

They gave him a name -- John Doe, because the protocol required a
clean start and his old name was part of the old life -- and they
gave him a set of civilian clothes and a data pad loaded with basic
information: how to use public transportation, how to buy food, how
to access the social services that the Federal Bureau of Corrections
was obligated to provide to released inmates. They gave him a voucher
for thirty days of housing at a rehabilitation hostel in the
commercial district of New Alcatraz City, the small settlement that
had grown up around the prison like a barnacle on a hull.

And then they opened the door and let him walk out.

John Doe -- who had been Frank Colter, who had been a bank robber,
who had been a man with skills and instincts and a past -- stepped
through the gates of New Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary and into the
pressurized dome that covered the city, and he stood on the sidewalk
and looked around, and everything he saw was new.

Not new in the sense of unfamiliar, exactly. He knew what buildings
were. He knew what streets were. He knew what people were, these
moving shapes in various sizes that passed him on the sidewalk,
each one carrying their own invisible weight of memory and
experience and identity. He knew all of these things in the
abstract, the way you know the rules of a game you've never played.
What he lacked was context. He knew that a building was a structure
where people lived or worked, but he didn't know which building was
his, or whether he had one. He knew that money was used to purchase
goods, but he didn't know how much things cost, or how much money
he had, or how to get more.

He stood on the sidewalk for twenty minutes, watching people walk
past, trying to learn the rules by observation. People walked with
purpose. They knew where they were going. They didn't stop in the
middle of the sidewalk and stare at things. They didn't examine their
own hands or touch the walls of buildings or look up at the dome
ceiling with the puzzled wonder of a child seeing the sky for the
first time.

He was conspicuous. He could feel it. He stood out the way a blank
page stands out in a book full of text.

A woman bumped into him. "Watch it," she said.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I don't know where I'm going."

She gave him a look -- suspicious, pitying, impatient -- and walked
on. He watched her go and tried to learn something from the way she
moved, the way she navigated the sidewalk, the unconscious confidence
of a person who had a destination and a reason to reach it.

He looked at his data pad. The hostel was at 14 Meridian Street. He
found a street sign. He was on Copernicus Avenue. The data pad had a
map function. He figured out how to use it. The hostel was six blocks
east.

He walked six blocks east. It took him forty minutes, because he kept
stopping -- not from fatigue, but from wonder, and from the
disorienting vertigo of experiencing a world without the cushion of
memory to soften its strangeness. Every sensation was raw, unfiltered,
unprocessed. The hum of the air recyclers. The smell of synthetic
food from a vendor's cart. The feel of the sidewalk through the thin
soles of his shoes. The low, constant vibration of the dome's
structural supports, a tremor so subtle that the long-term residents
had ceased to notice it, but that John Doe felt in his teeth.

He reached the hostel. He showed his voucher. The clerk -- a tired-
looking man who had processed too many lost souls to be curious about
one more -- assigned him a room. Third floor. Room 312. A cot, a
locker, a bathroom shared with the floor.

John Doe sat on the cot and tried to think.

He had no past. He had no identity. He had no skills, no connections,
no resources beyond a thirty-day voucher and a data pad. He was the
most free and the most helpless person he had ever met, which was not
saying much, since he was also the only person he had ever met, his
memory of everyone he'd ever known having been erased along with
everything else.

He needed to survive. That much he understood. The voucher lasted
thirty days. After that, he would need money, which meant he would
need work, which meant he would need skills, which meant he would
need to learn, from scratch, how to be a functional human being.

Thirty days.

He lay back on the cot and stared at the ceiling and tried to imagine
a future, and the future was as blank as his past, and the blankness
was terrifying, and he had no memory of ever being afraid before,
which made the fear worse, because he had nothing to compare it to,
no reassurance from past experience that fear could be survived.

He was, he realized, completely and utterly alone in a way that no
human being with an intact memory could fully comprehend.

He closed his eyes. He did not sleep.

                               IV.

The first week was the hardest.

He learned things the way a child learns things: by trial and error,
by observation, by the painful accumulation of experience one bruise
at a time. He learned that the food vendors on Copernicus Avenue
charged less than the ones on Main Dome Boulevard. He learned that
the air in the lower levels of the city tasted stale and metallic and
gave him headaches. He learned that people on the moon walked
differently than he expected -- a bouncing, efficient gait adapted to
the low gravity that he had to consciously mimic before it became
automatic.

He learned that he was good with his hands. This surprised him, since
he had no memory of ever using them for anything, but when the
hostel's water recycler broke down on his third day, he found himself
staring at the mechanism with a recognition that bypassed memory
entirely -- a bone-deep, muscle-deep understanding of how things fit
together, how systems worked, how to trace a malfunction to its
source. He fixed the recycler in twenty minutes. The hostel clerk
gave him a look of astonished gratitude and knocked two credits off
his daily rate.

He learned that he could read. Not just words -- he could read
people. Their expressions, their body language, the micro-signals of
intention and emotion that most people broadcast without knowing it.
He could tell when the vendor was overcharging him. He could tell when
the man in Room 310 was lying about where he'd been all night. He
could tell when the woman at the employment office was about to
reject his application before she opened her mouth.

These were skills. He didn't know where they came from -- they seemed
to be woven into the fabric of his nervous system, deeper than
episodic memory, part of the architecture rather than the furniture.
They were the skills of a man who had spent his life reading
situations and calculating angles, though John Doe didn't know that.
All he knew was that he could do things, and that the things he could
do might keep him alive.

On the fifth day, he got a job.

It was menial work -- cleaning and maintenance at a hydroponic farm
on the city's south side, the kind of work that nobody with options
would choose and that paid barely enough to cover food and shelter.
But it was work, and it gave him a structure, a reason to get up, a
place to go, a set of tasks that he could learn and perform and take
satisfaction in completing.

The farm's manager was a stocky woman named Bao who had the no-
nonsense demeanor of someone who grew food on the moon and had no
patience for anything that wasn't directly related to that objective.
She showed him how to clean the nutrient troughs, how to calibrate
the grow lights, how to monitor the pH levels in the irrigation
system. He learned fast. Faster than she expected.

"You've done this before," she said on his third day.

"I don't think I have."

"Nobody picks this up this fast without experience."

He didn't know how to explain that he had no experience in anything,
that his entire life, as far as he was concerned, had begun five
days ago, that he was learning to be human the way a castaway learns
to swim -- desperately, instinctively, with no instruction manual
and no margin for error.

"I'm a quick study," he said.

Bao grunted. "Quick studies are usually trouble."

"I'm not trouble."

"Everyone's trouble," Bao said. "The question is what kind."

                               V.

On the twelfth day, the past found him.

He was walking back to the hostel from the farm, following the route
he'd established through repetition — Copernicus to Seventh, Seventh
to Meridian, Meridian to the hostel door — when a man stepped out of
a doorway and blocked his path.

The man was big. Not just tall but thick, built like something
designed to resist impacts, with a shaved head and a scar that ran
from his left ear to the corner of his mouth. He wore a black
jacket and the kind of boots that were designed for kicking things.

"Frank," the man said.

John Doe — who was also, apparently, Frank — looked at the man and
felt nothing. No recognition. No memory. Just the blank,
unfurnished awareness of a stranger encountering another stranger.

"I think you have the wrong person," he said.

"I don't have the wrong person, Frank. I know your face. Ray Deacon
sent me."

The name meant nothing. "I don't know anyone named Ray Deacon."

The big man's scar twisted as he smiled. It was not a friendly smile.
"Yeah, Deacon said you'd say that. Said they wiped your brain. Said
you wouldn't remember. But here's the thing, Frank — Deacon remembers.
And Deacon remembers that you had two million credits stashed before
the feds grabbed you. Two million credits that never got recovered.
And Deacon wants to know where they are."

"I don't know what you're talking about."

The big man hit him. It was a short, professional punch — not a
haymaker, not a wild swing, but a precise, economical blow to the
solar plexus that dropped John Doe to his knees, gasping.

"Let me explain how this works," the big man said, squatting down to
eye level. "Deacon is in Cell Block D at New Alcatraz. He's doing
forty years. He's not getting out. But he's got friends on the
outside — me, for instance — and those friends have expenses. Two
million credits would cover a lot of expenses. So you're going to
think real hard about where you stashed that money, and you're going
to tell me, and then we're going to be done with each other. Or
you're going to make this difficult, and difficult is going to hurt."

John Doe knelt on the sidewalk, the pain in his stomach radiating
outward, and he thought: I am being punished for something I did not
do. Something a man I do not remember did, in a life I do not
recall, for reasons I cannot fathom. And the man who did those things
is gone — erased, deleted, wiped clean — and what is left is me, and
I am innocent, and my innocence means nothing because the past does
not care whether you remember it.

"I can't tell you what I don't know," he said.

The big man hit him again.

                               VI.

He went to Vasquez.

She was surprised to see him. Previous subjects had never come back —
not voluntarily, anyway. Subject One was dead. Subject Two was in a
psychiatric facility. Subject Three had disappeared into the lunar
underclass and had not been seen since.

John Doe sat in her office with a bruised face and a split lip and
told her what had happened.

"You didn't tell me about this," he said. "You didn't tell me that my
old life would come looking for me."

"We couldn't predict —"

"You couldn't predict that a bank robber's associates might want to
find him? You couldn't predict that erasing my memory wouldn't erase
theirs?"

Vasquez had the decency to look uncomfortable. "The program is
experimental. We're learning as we go."

"Learning." He touched his split lip. "I'm the experiment, and you're
learning. That's great. That's really great. What do I do now?"

"We can provide protection. Security escorts, relocation to a
different section of the city —"

"For how long?"

Vasquez didn't answer, because the answer was: not long enough.
The Bureau of Corrections had a budget for the Tabula Rasa program,
and that budget covered the procedure, thirty days of housing, and
a data pad. It did not cover a lifetime of protection from the
consequences of a life the subject could no longer remember.

"There's something else," he said. "The man who hit me — he said I
had two million credits hidden somewhere. Money from the robberies.
Is that true?"

"I can't disclose details of your prior —"

"Is it true?"

Vasquez looked at her desk. "The investigation noted that
approximately two million credits from the third robbery were never
recovered. Colter — you — never revealed the location. It was
assumed the money was hidden somewhere, but it was never found."

John Doe laughed. It was a short, sharp, humorless sound. "So
somewhere in this city — or on this moon, or on Earth, or floating
in a locker in orbit — there's two million credits that belong to
me. That I hid. That I planned and schemed and risked my life to
steal. And I can't remember where they are. And the people who want
them are going to keep hitting me until I do remember, which I
can't, because you made sure of that."

"The procedure was your choice, Mr. — John."

"Was it? Because the man who made that choice doesn't exist anymore.
I'm the one living with the consequences, and I didn't choose
anything. I didn't choose to rob banks. I didn't choose to go to
prison. I didn't choose this procedure. Frank Colter chose all of
those things, and Frank Colter is gone, and I'm what's left, and
what's left is getting beaten up in alleys by people Frank Colter
owed money to."

Vasquez said nothing, because there was nothing to say.

John Doe stood up. "Thanks for the fresh start, Doc. It's been
swell."

He walked out.

                               VII.

He went back to the farm. He worked his shift. He cleaned the
nutrient troughs and calibrated the grow lights and monitored the pH
levels, and the work was simple and physical and demanded just enough
attention to keep him from thinking about the man in the black jacket
and the two million credits that his erased self had hidden somewhere
in the solar system.

Bao watched him work and said nothing for two hours. Then she said,
"Who hit you?"

"Nobody."

"Nobody hits hard. You want to tell me about it?"

"No."

"You going to be here tomorrow?"

He looked at her. "Why?"

"Because I've got a farm to run and I need to know if my best
cleaner is going to show up or if I need to find a replacement."

"I'll be here."

"Good." She went back to her tomatoes. Then, without looking up:
"There's a storage room in the back. It's got a lock. If you need
a place to sleep that isn't wherever you've been sleeping, you can
use it. The cot is lousy but the door is solid."

He looked at her. She didn't look back. She was a woman who offered
kindness the way she grew tomatoes: without sentiment, without
expectation, as a practical necessity in an environment that was
fundamentally hostile to life.

"Thank you," he said.

"Don't mention it. And I mean that literally. Don't mention it.
I've got a reputation to maintain."

He moved into the storage room that night. The cot was, as
advertised, lousy. But the door was solid, and for the first time
since his rebirth, he slept.

                               VIII.

The big man came back three days later. He brought a friend.

They found John Doe in the alley behind the farm, taking out the
compost. The friend was smaller but meaner, with the twitchy energy
of someone who enjoyed his work.

"Last chance, Frank," the big man said. "Where's the money?"

"I don't know."

"Wrong answer."

They worked him over. Professionally, methodically, with the
practiced efficiency of men who had done this before. The big man
held him while the small one hit. Ribs, kidneys, face. Not enough
to hospitalize — just enough to hurt, just enough to make the point.

When they were done, the big man squatted next to him again.

"Here's how it's going to go, Frank. You've got one week. One week
to remember, or to figure out, or to find some other way to come up
with two million credits. After that, we stop being polite."

They left him in the alley. He lay on the composite-stone surface
and looked up at the dome's structural supports and tasted blood
and thought: I am innocent. I have committed no crime. I have no
memory of wrongdoing. I am, by every legal and philosophical and
moral definition, an innocent man.

And it doesn't matter. Because innocence is not armor. Innocence
is not a shield. Innocence is just a word, and words don't stop
fists.

He pulled himself up. He went inside. He cleaned the blood off his
face. He went back to work.

Bao saw him and said, "Same nobody?"

"Same nobody."

"You need to do something about this nobody."

"I know."

"You need help?"

He looked at her — this stocky, practical, unsentimental woman who
grew tomatoes on the moon and offered storage rooms to strangers and
asked if they needed help with a tone that suggested she was fully
prepared to provide it, possibly with a hydroponic wrench.

"I think I do," he said.

                               IX.

The solution, when it came, was not clever. It was not the kind of
elegant, multi-layered scheme that Frank Colter might have devised.
It was simple, direct, and relied on the one advantage that John Doe
had over the man he used to be: he had nothing to lose.

He went to the police.

Not the prison administration, not the Bureau of Corrections, not
any of the institutions that had created him and washed their hands
of him. He went to the New Alcatraz City Police Department, walked
up to the desk sergeant, and said, "My name is John Doe. I used
to be Frank Colter. I was released from New Alcatraz under the
Tabula Rasa program. I have no memory of my previous life. I am
being assaulted by associates of my former partner, Ray Deacon, who
want me to reveal the location of two million credits that were
stolen in a bank robbery that I can no longer remember committing.
I need help."

The desk sergeant looked at him the way a man looks at a math
problem he doesn't have the tools to solve.

"You're telling me you're a convicted bank robber who got his
memory wiped and now the other bank robbers want their money back?"

"That's what I'm telling you."

"And you don't remember where the money is?"

"I don't remember anything."

The sergeant leaned back. "That's a new one."

It took three days, two detectives, a meeting with the district
attorney, and a conference call with the Bureau of Corrections, but
in the end, the law did what the law was supposed to do: it
protected an innocent man. Not because the system was designed for
cases like his — it wasn't — but because a detective named Ruiz
listened to his story, looked at his bruised face, and decided that
whatever Frank Colter had done, John Doe hadn't done it, and John
Doe deserved the same protection as anyone else.

They arrested the big man and his friend. They put a flag on
Deacon's communications. They set up a security detail at the farm.
And they helped John Doe file for a legal name change and a new
identity document — the final, formal severance of the thread
connecting him to the man he used to be.

He chose the name John Bao. Bao had not asked him to. He had not
asked her permission. When she found out, she said, "That's the
stupidest thing I've ever heard," and then she didn't talk to him
for two days, and when she started talking to him again, her voice
was different — softer, with a roughness around the edges that might
have been emotion, though she would have denied it under oath.

                               X.

Six months later, John Bao was assistant manager of the farm. He
had a small apartment on the south side. He had a library card. He
had a routine: wake up, go to work, tend the plants, eat dinner,
read, sleep. It was a small life. It was not exciting. It contained
no bank robberies, no getaway cars, no two-million-credit scores.

It was his.

He thought about the money sometimes. Two million credits, hidden
somewhere by a man who no longer existed, waiting for someone who
would never come. It was an abstract thought — he felt no connection
to the fortune, no desire for it, no sense that it belonged to him.
It belonged to Frank Colter, and Frank Colter was dead, and the dead
don't need money.

He thought about the procedure sometimes, too. The trade he had
made — or that Colter had made, or that they had made together, the
man-who-was and the man-who-would-be, sharing a body on that table
for four hours while one became the other. Everything for nothing.
A full life for an empty one. A guilty past for an innocent future.

Was it worth it?

He didn't know. He couldn't know. The man who could have answered
that question — who could have compared the two lives, weighed
them, judged which was worth more — didn't exist. He had been
divided in half by a chrome crown and sixteen electrodes, and the
half that could remember was gone, and the half that remained could
only go forward.

But forward was something. Forward was the tomatoes growing under
the lights. Forward was Bao's gruff voice telling him to calibrate
the pH levels. Forward was the library book on his nightstand and
the apartment with his name — his chosen name, his new name — on
the door. Forward was a life that had been given to him empty and
that he was filling, day by day, with the small, hard-won, precious
currency of experience.

He locked up the farm at the end of his shift, walked home through
the pressurized streets of New Alcatraz City, looked up at the dome
that held the air in and the void out, and he thought: I am John
Bao. I am six months old. I have no past. I have no crimes. I have
a job, and a name, and a woman who would deny it but cares whether
I show up tomorrow.

It wasn't much. But it was his. Every piece of it, earned and
chosen and remembered.

He went home. He made dinner. He read his book.

The moon hung in the sky beyond the dome, or rather the Earth did
— a blue marble above the gray horizon, impossibly beautiful,
impossibly far away, full of people who had pasts, who carried their
histories on their backs like snails carrying shells, who were
shaped and burdened and enriched by everything they'd ever done.

John Bao carried nothing. He walked light. And if the lightness
was sometimes terrifying, it was also, in moments like this —
standing at the window, looking at the Earth, knowing that tomorrow
held only what he chose to put in it — a kind of freedom that no
pardon could have granted and no prison could have taken away.

He turned off the light. He went to bed.

Tomorrow he would learn something new. He always did.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                    TRANSMUTATION LESSONS

                      by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                               I.

The first thing Kai Chen noticed about the Aurelius colony was the
color of the soil. It was not the red of iron oxide or the gray of
silicate or the black of carbon-rich regolith — it was gold. Not
metaphorically gold, not amber or ochre or tawny or any of the
approximations that the human eye casually files under "gold" when
the actual color is something else entirely. It was gold: the deep,
warm, unmistakable gold of the element itself, atomic number 79,
as if the ground had been plated by some enormous and patient jeweler.

Kai knelt at the edge of the landing pad and scooped a handful of
the soil. It was fine-grained, almost silky, and it glittered in the
light of Aurelius's sun — a K-type main-sequence star that hung in
the amber sky like a lantern behind frosted glass. She let the soil
run through her fingers and watched the way it caught the light, and
she thought: this is why they named the colony Aurelius. Not for the
Stoic philosopher. For the gold.

She was twenty-six years old, freshly graduated from the University
of Hokkaido's xenobotany program, and this was her first field
posting. Her assignment was straightforward: assist Dr. Emile Farad,
the colony's chief scientist, in cataloguing and classifying the
native flora of Aurelius IV. The planet had been surveyed by drone
three years prior and found to possess an ecosystem of unusual
complexity — a dense, globe-spanning network of plant life that
exhibited biochemical properties unlike anything in the terrestrial
catalog. The Colonial Botanical Survey wanted a comprehensive species
inventory before the mining consortium that had funded the colony's
establishment began its extraction operations.

Kai had read the preliminary reports on the six-month voyage out.
The data was fascinating but fragmentary: spectroscopic analyses
suggesting the presence of metallic compounds in the plant tissues,
atmospheric readings indicating unusual concentrations of volatilized
metals, soil assays that were, to use the technical language of the
survey team, "confusing as hell." The plants of Aurelius IV appeared
to be doing something with metals that no terrestrial organism had
ever been observed to do, and the survey team, which had consisted
of two geologists and a microbiologist with no botanical training,
had lacked the expertise to determine what that something was.

That was where Kai came in. And that was where Dr. Emile Farad came
in, though "came in" suggested a degree of institutional cooperation
that, as Kai would soon discover, bore very little relationship to
the reality of Farad's operation.

She found him in his laboratory, which occupied a pressurized dome
at the eastern edge of the colony compound. The dome was large —
twenty meters in diameter — and it was, to put it charitably, a
mess. Workbenches overflowed with sample containers, microscope
slides, spectrographic printouts, soil cores, pressed botanical
specimens, and what appeared to be several months' worth of unwashed
coffee cups. The floor was covered with a fine layer of golden dust
that had been tracked in from outside and never cleaned up. The air
smelled of growth medium, chemical solvents, and the particular
musty sweetness that Kai associated with living plant material in
enclosed spaces.

Farad himself was a small, wiry man of sixty with a shock of white
hair that appeared to be in a state of permanent electrical
agitation and eyes that burned with the specific, slightly
frightening intensity of a scientist who has found something
important and hasn't slept properly since. He was standing at a
workbench, peering into a microscope, and he did not look up when
Kai entered.

"You're the botanist," he said.

"I'm Kai Chen. Dr. Farad, I've been assigned to —"

"Yes, yes, I know. The survey. The catalogue. Species A through
whatever. How many species of plant can you identify by
morphological characteristics alone?"

"I — well, it depends on the taxonomic framework, but —"

"On Earth. How many?"

"Several hundred. More if we include cultivars and —"

"Forget Earth. Everything you learned about terrestrial botany is
useless here. Not wrong — useless. The plants on this world do not
follow terrestrial rules. They follow rules I have spent two years
trying to understand, and I am only now beginning to glimpse the
shape of them." He looked up from the microscope, and his eyes fixed
on her with an intensity that made her feel like a specimen on a
slide. "Can you unlearn?"

"I'm sorry?"

"Can you unlearn what you think you know and learn what is actually
happening? Because that is the only useful skill on this planet.
Not knowledge. The willingness to abandon knowledge when the
evidence demands it."

Kai straightened. "I'm a scientist, Dr. Farad. That's what we do."

Farad studied her for a moment. Then, unexpectedly, he smiled.
"Good. Come look at this."

He stepped aside from the microscope, and Kai leaned in. On the
slide, magnified four hundred times, was a cross-section of plant
tissue — a stem, she judged from the cellular architecture, though
the cells were larger than she expected and arranged in a
configuration she did not recognize. The cell walls were thick and
darkly pigmented, but it was what was inside the cells that made
her breath catch.

The vacuoles — the fluid-filled compartments that in terrestrial
plants served as storage and waste-processing centers — were filled
with metal. Not metallic salts or metallic compounds or the trace
metallic elements that terrestrial plants absorbed from soil through
their root systems. Metal. Pure, elemental metal, in concentrations
so dense that under magnification the vacuoles gleamed like tiny
mirrors.

"Is that —" she began.

"Gold," Farad said. "Elemental gold. Au-197. The cells are
producing it."

Kai looked at him. "That's impossible."

"I agree. And yet." He gestured at the microscope. "The evidence
is very clear about its indifference to our opinions."

                               II.

Over the following days, Farad introduced Kai to Aurelius IV's flora
with the methodical fervor of a man who had been waiting two years
for someone who could understand what he was seeing.

The planet's ecosystem was dominated by a single phylum — Farad had
designated it Chrysophyta aureliana, the golden plants of Aurelius,
though the designation was provisional and the taxonomy, as he
freely acknowledged, was probably wrong. The phylum encompassed
hundreds of morphologically distinct species, ranging from
microscopic ground-cover organisms that formed dense, moss-like
mats on the soil surface to towering arborescent forms, twenty
meters tall, with trunks of densely mineralized tissue and canopies
of broad, metallic-sheened leaves that clattered softly in the
wind like wind chimes.

They were beautiful. Kai had not expected beauty — she had expected
the alien, the unfamiliar, the biologically interesting but
aesthetically neutral — but the forests of Aurelius IV were
stunningly, heartbreakingly beautiful. The trees caught the amber
light of the K-type sun and reflected it in spectra that ranged
from pale champagne to deep amber to the rich, warm gold that gave
the soil its color. Walking beneath their canopy was like walking
through a cathedral made of light, the filtered illumination casting
everything in tones of honey and copper, and the sound of the
metallic leaves in the breeze was a soft, continuous music that
Kai felt as much as heard.

But it was the biochemistry that mattered, and the biochemistry
was, as Farad had warned, like nothing she had ever encountered.

Terrestrial plants performed photosynthesis: they used sunlight to
convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The plants
of Aurelius IV performed something analogous but fundamentally
different. They used sunlight — specifically, the infrared-heavy
spectrum of the K-type star — to drive a process that Farad had
tentatively named transmutation photosynthesis: the conversion of
one element into another through biologically mediated nuclear
processes.

"That violates conservation of baryon number," Kai said when Farad
first explained it.

"No it doesn't," Farad said. "It just does it in a way we haven't
observed before. The cells contain structures — I call them
chrysosomes — that appear to function as biological particle
accelerators. They concentrate atomic nuclei to densities sufficient
for fusion reactions, using enzyme complexes that I have not yet
characterized. The energy input comes from light. The energy output
is stored in the metallic products. It is, essentially, biological
alchemy. The plants transmute elements."

Kai spent three days verifying this claim. She took samples from
twelve species across four habitats — forest, grassland, wetland,
and the rocky substrate of a mountainside — and subjected them to
every analytical technique in the laboratory's arsenal. Mass
spectrometry confirmed the presence of elemental metals in the
plant tissues: gold, silver, platinum, copper, and trace quantities
of rarer elements. Isotopic analysis confirmed that the metals had
not been absorbed from the soil — their isotopic ratios were
different from those in the surrounding substrate, consistent with
in situ synthesis rather than uptake.

The plants were making metal. Making it the way terrestrial plants
made sugar. As a natural, metabolic byproduct of their interaction
with sunlight and soil.

"This is the most significant biological discovery since —" Kai
paused, trying to think of an adequate comparison.

"Since the discovery of biology," Farad said. "I know. I have been
living with it for two years. It does not become less astonishing."

                               III.

The colony's director was a man named Holt, and he was interested
in gold.

Not in the biological mechanisms that produced it, not in the
evolutionary pressures that had given rise to transmutation
photosynthesis, not in the staggering implications for physics and
biochemistry and the fundamental understanding of what biological
systems were capable of. He was interested in gold, specifically
in the quantity of gold that the plants produced, and more
specifically in whether that quantity could be increased.

"The mining consortium funded this colony," Holt told Kai and Farad
at a meeting in his office two weeks after Kai's arrival. He was
a broad-shouldered man with the patient, implacable demeanor of
someone who had been sent to deliver a return on investment and
intended to do exactly that. "They funded it because the drone
survey detected anomalous metallic signatures in the biomass.
Anomalous metallic signatures, in the consortium's vocabulary, means
'money.' They want to know how much and how fast."

Farad's white hair seemed to bristle. "The plants are not a mining
operation, Director. They are a biological system of extraordinary
complexity. If we begin harvesting them on an industrial scale
before we understand how the ecosystem functions —"

"I'm not asking you to understand the ecosystem, Doctor. I'm
asking you to increase the gold yield."

Farad stared at Holt with the particular fury of a scientist
confronting a bureaucrat, which is one of nature's most ancient
and futile confrontations. "And I am telling you that attempting
to increase the yield without understanding the system is not
merely premature — it is dangerous. We do not know what these
organisms are doing at a systemic level. The individual plant
transmutes elements, yes. But the ecosystem — the interconnected
network of hundreds of species exchanging metabolites through root
systems and atmospheric volatiles and God knows what other
mechanisms — the ecosystem may be doing something far more complex.
Something we have not yet grasped."

"Such as?"

"I don't know. That's rather the point."

Holt looked at Kai. "What's your assessment, Dr. Chen?"

Kai hesitated. She had been at Aurelius IV for two weeks. She had
barely begun the systematic survey she had been sent to conduct.
But she had seen enough — in the tissue samples, in the isotopic
data, in the way the forest ecosystem pulsed and glittered like a
single vast organism — to know that Farad was right.

"I agree with Dr. Farad," she said. "The ecosystem is interconnected
in ways we don't yet understand. The transmutation process may
depend on systemic conditions — species interactions, soil
chemistry, atmospheric composition — that could be disrupted by
large-scale harvesting. We need at least another year of baseline
study before we can make recommendations about exploitation."

Holt's expression did not change. "The consortium has authorized
a preliminary harvest of one hundred hectares. The order is
effective immediately. I'd like your cooperation, but I don't
require it."

He stood, signaling that the meeting was over. Farad and Kai
walked out into the amber light, and Farad said, with a quiet
intensity that was more disturbing than shouting, "They are going
to kill it."

"We don't know that."

"I do know it. I have spent two years watching this ecosystem,
and I know it the way a doctor knows a patient. It is balanced.
It is interconnected. It is, in ways I cannot yet articulate,
a single thing. And when you start cutting pieces off a single
thing, the single thing dies."

Kai looked out at the golden forest, at the way the light moved
through the canopy like something alive, and she felt the weight
of what she was witnessing: the collision between two systems, one
biological and one economic, each operating according to its own
implacable logic, and neither capable of comprehending the other.

"Then we need to prove it," she said. "We need to document the
interconnection. We need to show them what they'll destroy."

Farad looked at her. "How long?"

"Give me six months."

"We have six weeks. That's when the harvest equipment arrives."

Six weeks. Six weeks to map an alien ecosystem, to trace the
invisible threads connecting hundreds of species across thousands
of hectares, to build a case that would convince men whose primary
language was profit margin.

"Then I'll need to work fast," Kai said.

                               IV.

She worked fast.

She worked the way Farad had taught her — not with the systematic
caution of a textbook survey but with the urgent, improvisational
energy of a field researcher who knows that the subject may not
survive long enough for a second look. She collected samples from
dawn to dusk, moving through the golden forests with a collection
kit in one hand and a data recorder in the other, cataloguing
species, mapping distributions, tracking the flow of metabolites
through the ecosystem like a detective tracing the movement of
money through a laundering operation.

What she found confirmed Farad's intuition and exceeded his
predictions.

The ecosystem was not merely interconnected. It was integrated. The
hundreds of species that comprised the Chrysophyta phylum were not
independent organisms competing for resources in the traditional
ecological sense. They were components of a single, planet-spanning
metabolic network, each species performing a specific function in a
chain of elemental transmutations that began with the simplest
elements — hydrogen and helium absorbed from the atmosphere — and
built progressively heavier elements through a cascade of biological
fusion reactions that passed from organism to organism through an
intricate web of root exudates, airborne volatiles, and direct
tissue exchange.

The ground-cover species — the golden mosses — performed the first
stage: hydrogen to lithium, lithium to carbon. The understory
shrubs performed the second: carbon to silicon, silicon to iron.
The tall arborescent forms — the golden trees — performed the third
and most spectacular stage: iron to copper, copper to silver,
silver to gold.

But it was not merely a production chain. It was a cycle. The
metallic products — the gold, the silver, the platinum — were not
waste products or endpoints. They were inputs for the next stage
of the cycle, absorbed by the mosses through their root systems
and broken down — transmuted in reverse — back to the lighter
elements from which the cycle began. The ecosystem was a closed
loop, a self-sustaining reactor that cycled elements upward and
downward through the periodic table in a continuous, balanced
oscillation that had been running, based on geological evidence,
for approximately three hundred million years.

And in the center of the cycle — at the point of maximum
complexity, where the upward and downward transmutation cascades
intersected — the ecosystem was producing something that was not
an element at all.

Kai found it in the deep forest, in the oldest groves, where the
golden trees were largest and the canopy was densest and the
filtered light took on a quality that was less illumination than
suffusion, as if the air itself were luminous. The trees there
exuded a substance — a sap, if the word could be applied to
something so far beyond the terrestrial concept of plant sap —
that collected in pools at their bases, thick and slow-moving and
absolutely transparent, like liquid glass.

She analyzed it. She analyzed it three times, because the first
two results were so improbable that she assumed instrument error.
The substance was not a compound. It was not a mixture. It was
a matrix — a substrate in which individual atoms were suspended in
a precise three-dimensional lattice that did not correspond to any
known crystal structure, in which the spacing between atoms was
maintained not by electromagnetic forces but by something her
instruments could not identify.

And the atoms in the lattice were not atoms of any single element.
They were atoms in transition — captured in the act of
transmutation, frozen between one elemental identity and another,
each atom simultaneously occupying two positions on the periodic
table, like a coin spinning in the air that is both heads and
tails until it lands.

Kai stared at the spectrographic readout and felt the hair rise
on the back of her neck.

"Dr. Farad," she called over the radio. "You need to see this."

                               V.

Farad saw it. He stood at the edge of the pool in the deep forest,
the amber light filtering through the canopy above, the transparent
substance gleaming at their feet, and he was silent for a long time.

"I suspected," he said at last. "I have suspected for a year.
But I did not have the data. I did not have —" He gestured at Kai's
data recorder. "I did not have you."

"What is it?"

"It is what the ecosystem is for." He knelt and touched the surface
of the pool with one gloved finger. The substance responded — not
chemically, not physically, but informationally. A ripple passed
through the lattice, a reorganization of the atomic structure that
propagated outward from the point of contact at a speed that Kai's
instruments clocked at three hundred meters per second — not the
speed of sound in the medium, but a different speed entirely, the
speed at which information traveled through the lattice.

"The individual plants transmute elements," Farad said. "That is
remarkable, but it is only the mechanism. The mechanism serves a
purpose. The purpose is this." He gestured at the pool. "The
ecosystem, operating as an integrated whole, is producing a
substance that is not merely a chemical product but an information
substrate. A medium in which atomic states can be maintained in
superposition — in which matter itself can be held in a state of
quantum indeterminacy at the macroscopic level."

Kai's mind raced. "A room-temperature quantum substrate. That's —
that would be —"

"The most valuable substance in the universe. More valuable than
gold by a factor of — well. By a factor that renders the concept
of gold's value quaint." Farad stood up. "This is what the mining
consortium does not understand. They want gold. The gold is a
byproduct. It is the sawdust generated by a workshop that is
building something inconceivably more sophisticated. And if they
cut down the trees for the sawdust, they will destroy the workshop,
and the thing the workshop produces will be lost."

"A quantum substrate," Kai murmured, still staring at the pool.
"Produced biologically. At room temperature. With no external
energy input beyond sunlight." The implications unfolded in her
mind like the petals of a flower, each one revealing another layer
of significance. "Quantum computing. Quantum communication.
Quantum —"

"Everything," Farad said. "Quantum everything. The computational
capacity alone would exceed the combined output of every computer
ever built by humanity. And it is being produced by plants.
Silently, continuously, for three hundred million years. On a world
that a mining consortium wants to strip for gold."

They stood together in the deep forest, in the golden light, and
listened to the soft metallic music of the leaves, and the enormity
of what they had found pressed down on them with a weight that was
not physical but moral.

"We have to stop the harvest," Kai said.

"Yes."

"Holt won't listen to theoretical arguments. He needs to see
practical value. He needs to understand that this substance is worth
more than all the gold on this planet."

"It is worth more than all the gold in the solar system."

"Then we need to demonstrate that. We need to show him what it does,
not just what it is."

Farad was quiet for a moment. Then he said, "There is a risk."

"A risk?"

"If we demonstrate the value of the substance, we save the
ecosystem from the harvest. But we create a different threat. A
substance of this value will attract attention. Powerful attention.
The kind of attention that does not merely exploit a resource but
monopolizes it. Controls it. Militarizes it."

Kai looked at the pool, at its impossible transparency, at the
shimmer of quantum indeterminacy playing across its surface like
heat haze above a desert road. "What's the alternative? We say
nothing, and they cut down the forest for gold, and this is
destroyed."

"There is a third option," Farad said. "We document everything.
We publish. We make the data available to every scientific
institution, every university, every government, every person with
access to a research terminal. We make it impossible to suppress,
impossible to monopolize, impossible to control. We give it to
everyone."

"The consortium will fire us."

"The consortium will do considerably worse than fire us. But the
data will be out. And once data is out, it cannot be put back in."

Kai thought about it. She thought about her career, which was
barely begun and which an act of corporate defiance would almost
certainly end. She thought about Farad, who had spent two years
alone on this planet, watching something miraculous and knowing
that the miracle was in danger. She thought about the golden forest,
the three-hundred-million-year-old engine cycling elements through
the periodic table with patient, silent, incomprehensible purpose.
She thought about the pools of quantum substrate, gleaming in the
deep groves, holding the potential for a technological revolution
so vast that it defied estimation.

And she thought about what would happen to all of it — the forest,
the substrate, the miracle — if she did nothing.

"We publish," she said.

Farad smiled. It was a tired, gentle, deeply relieved smile, the
smile of a man who had been carrying a weight alone and had just
felt someone take hold of the other end.

"We publish," he agreed. "Tonight."

                               VI.

They worked through the night.

Kai compiled the data: six weeks of field observations,
spectroscopic analyses, isotopic profiles, ecological maps,
distribution surveys, tissue samples, metabolic pathway diagrams.
Farad wrote the paper — or rather, he dictated and Kai transcribed,
because Farad's handwriting was illegible and his relationship with
keyboards adversarial. The paper was sixty pages long. It described
the transmutation photosynthesis mechanism, the integrated ecosystem
architecture, the elemental cycling cascade, and — in a final
section that Farad wrote with particular care, choosing every word
as if placing stones in a wall that needed to withstand a siege —
the quantum substrate.

They titled it: "Biological Transmutation and Macroscopic Quantum
Substrate Production in the Chrysophyta Ecosystem of Aurelius IV:
Implications for Conservation, Computation, and the Limits of
Known Physics."

"That title is too long," Kai said.

"All important titles are too long," Farad said. "Brevity is for
people who have nothing to say."

At 0400 hours local time, with the amber dawn just beginning to
lighten the eastern horizon, they transmitted the paper
simultaneously to seventeen scientific journals, forty-two
university research departments, the Colonial Botanical Survey,
the United Nations Committee on Xenobiological Resources, and —
because Farad had a flair for the dramatic that his disheveled
appearance belied — the personal terminal of every member of the
Colonial Science Advisory Board.

At 0412 hours, Holt's comm unit began buzzing.

At 0430 hours, Holt was at the laboratory door, his face the color
of raw meat.

"What have you done?" he said.

"We have done our jobs," Farad said. "We have reported our
findings."

"You have jeopardized a multi-billion-credit operation —"

"We have saved a multi-billion-credit resource. The gold you want
is a waste product, Director. The true product of this ecosystem
is a quantum information substrate that will revolutionize every
field of technology that depends on computation, communication, or
materials science. Which is to say: every field of technology. If
you cut down this forest, you will destroy the most valuable
discovery in human history in order to collect its sawdust."

Holt stood in the doorway, the anger on his face warring with
something else — the dawning, unwelcome recognition that the ground
had shifted beneath him and that the world he had been sent to
exploit was not the world he had arrived on.

"The consortium —" he began.

"The consortium will adapt," Kai said. "They're businessmen.
When they understand what's actually here — what this ecosystem
is actually producing — they'll find the gold irrelevant. The
quantum substrate is worth more. Infinitely more. But only if
the ecosystem that produces it is left intact."

Holt looked at them. He looked at the laboratory, with its
mountains of data and its unwashed coffee cups and its two
scientists who had just, in the space of a single night, made
his entire operational plan obsolete.

"You're both fired," he said.

"Probably," Farad agreed.

"And possibly prosecuted."

"Also probably."

Holt turned and walked out. Through the laboratory's window, Kai
watched him cross the compound toward his office, a man walking
into a future he had not anticipated and did not understand.

She looked at Farad. "What now?"

"Now we wait. The data is out. The scientific community will
respond. The consortium will calculate. And the ecosystem —" He
looked out the window, at the golden forest shimmering in the
early light, three hundred million years of silent alchemy
continuing its work, indifferent to the small human dramas
playing out at its edge. "The ecosystem will continue to do what
it has always done. It does not require our permission, or our
understanding, or our protection. It requires only that we do
not destroy it. Everything else is commentary."

                               VII.

The response was immediate and overwhelming.

Within seventy-two hours, the paper had been downloaded forty
thousand times. Within a week, three independent research teams
had petitioned the Colonial Science Advisory Board for permission
to visit Aurelius IV. Within two weeks, the United Nations
Committee on Xenobiological Resources had issued a preliminary
injunction halting all mining operations on the planet pending
a full ecological assessment.

The consortium protested, hired lawyers, applied political
pressure, and ultimately — when the quantum computing community
published a joint letter signed by four hundred researchers
explaining, in terms that even a board of directors could
understand, that the Aurelius ecosystem was worth more than the
entire precious metals market of the solar system — the consortium
pivoted. They did not abandon Aurelius IV. They reclassified it.
It was no longer a mining colony. It was a research preserve,
and the consortium's role was no longer extraction but stewardship,
which was, they discovered, more profitable by several orders of
magnitude.

Holt was recalled. His replacement was a woman named Dr. Amara
Osei, a conservation ecologist from the University of Accra,
who arrived, surveyed the golden forest, and wept — not from
sadness but from the particular emotion that scientists experience
when confronted with something so beautiful and so complex that
the only adequate response is to stand still and let it wash
over you.

Farad was not fired. Nor was Kai. Instead, they were appointed
co-directors of the newly established Aurelius Xenobotanical
Institute, funded by a consortium that had learned — expensively,
reluctantly, but finally — that the most valuable thing on
Aurelius IV was not what could be taken from it but what could
be learned from it.

Kai spent the next thirty years on Aurelius IV. She mapped the
ecosystem species by species, interaction by interaction, cycle
by cycle, building a picture of such complexity and such beauty
that the scientific papers she published — 247 of them, over
three decades — read less like technical documents than like
love letters to an alien world.

She never married. She never left. She found, in the golden
forests and the quantum pools and the soft metallic music of
the leaves, a companionship that was not human but was
nonetheless sustaining — the companionship of a world that
had spent three hundred million years perfecting a process
that humanity had dreamed of for millennia, and that offered
its secrets not grudgingly or conditionally but with the
patient, unhurried generosity of a teacher who has all the
time in the universe.

On her sixty-first birthday, she walked alone into the deep
forest, to the grove where she and Farad had first found the
quantum pools, and she sat on a root of the oldest tree and
watched the transparent substance shimmer in the filtered
light. Farad was gone — he had died peacefully in his sleep
five years earlier, at the age of ninety-two, in the
laboratory he had never fully cleaned — and she missed him
the way she missed rain, with a gentle, persistent ache for
something she had known once and would not know again.

The forest hummed around her. The leaves chimed. The quantum
pools gleamed, holding their atoms in infinite suspension,
neither one thing nor another, simultaneously everything and
nothing, balanced on the knife-edge between states like the
planet itself, balanced between what it was and what humanity
might try to make it.

"Thank you," she said, to the forest, to the pools, to
Farad's memory, to the three-hundred-million-year-old engine
that had been running before her species had learned to walk
upright and would, if she and others like her did their work
well, be running long after.

The forest did not answer. It did not need to. It simply
continued, as it always had, transmuting light into gold
and gold into something more precious than gold, and the
sound of its leaves in the wind was all the answer that Kai
Chen — botanist, apprentice, keeper of the golden world —
would ever need.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV holds a doctorate in astrophysics from the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is currently a professor at
the California Institute of Technology, where he divides his time
between teaching, research, and writing fiction that he insists is "not
entirely implausible." His story "Perihelion" (Issue #3) established him
as one of the leading voices in hard science fiction, and he has
contributed to nearly every issue of this magazine since its founding.
He lives in Pasadena with his wife, physicist Elena Mirova, and a
collection of model rockets that occupies most of the living room.
"Planetfall" is his twentieth story for Tales from the Future and Beyond.

THEODORE CAIN is a technical writer for General Motors by day and a
fiction writer by night, a dual career he has maintained with remarkable
consistency since 1953. Born and raised in Detroit, Cain served in the
infantry in Europe during the war, attended Wayne State University on
the GI Bill, and has been writing science fiction at the rate of
approximately one story per month ever since an editor named Sterling
made the mistake of encouraging him. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan,
with his wife Jean and their three children. "First House on Mars" is his
eighteenth story for this magazine, and he shows no signs of slowing
down.

REX DRUMMOND was born in Midland, Texas, served as a bomber pilot in
the Eighth Air Force during the war (twenty-three missions, one
Distinguished Flying Cross, one steel plate in his left leg), and
discovered science fiction in 1951 when a friend left a copy of Planet
Stories in his truck. He sold his first story to this magazine in 1953,
and readers have been requesting more ever since. When not writing, he
can be found at conventions, holding court in the hotel bar while
wearing cowboy boots and telling stories that are almost certainly
exaggerated. "Iron Marshal" is his fifth story for Tales from the
Future and Beyond, and his first featuring U.S. Space Marshal Boone
Taggart, who will, we suspect, ride again.

HARRISON BLACKWOOD lives in Brattleboro, Vermont, in a farmhouse that
has been in his family since the eighteenth century. He attended
Middlebury College, served in the Army in the Pacific, and has spent
the years since the war farming, reading, and writing fiction that
explores the darker implications of humanity's place in the cosmos. His
mother, an amateur astronomer, gave him his first telescope at age seven;
he has been staring into the void ever since, and the void, it appears,
has been staring back. He lives with his wife Ruth. "The Widow's Walk"
is his fourth story for this magazine.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY has been writing fiction since 1939, when he sold
his first story to Thrilling Wonder Stories at the age of twenty-two.
Since then, he estimates that he has published over two hundred stories
across every pulp genre known to man, under his own name and at least
three pseudonyms he declines to reveal. A native of Chicago's South
Side, Finley is a proud graduate of the Chicago Public Library, a
devoted White Sox fan, and an unapologetic practitioner of the pulp
tradition. He lives in Rogers Park with his wife Carol, several cats,
and enough manuscripts to constitute a fire hazard. "Reset" is his
seventh story for Tales from the Future and Beyond.

MARGARET THORNTON holds a master's degree in marine biology from the
University of Washington and worked as a research assistant at the
Friday Harbor Laboratories before turning to writing full-time. Her
fiction draws on her deep knowledge of biology and ecology to create
alien worlds that are scientifically rigorous and luminously imagined.
She is active in the Sierra Club and the nascent environmental movement,
and she brings a conservationist's sensibility to her vision of
humanity's future among the stars. She lives alone on Orcas Island in
the San Juan archipelago, where she maintains a garden, a tide pool
survey, and a correspondence with scientists on three continents. "The
Alchemist's Apprentice" is her fifth story for this magazine.

                     Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading Issue #12, and I must write to say that
Dr. Koslov's "The Littoral Zone" is the finest story I have read in
any science fiction magazine this year. His treatment of the question
of planetary sentience is both scientifically plausible and profoundly
moving. I found myself thinking about it for days afterward -- a sure
sign of a story that has done its job. More Koslov, please!

-- James Hartley, Ann Arbor, Michigan

*

Dear Editor,

I wish to register a complaint regarding Rex Drummond's "Canyon Run"
in Issue #11. While I enjoy a good space adventure as much as the next
man, the orbital mechanics in Mr. Drummond's chase sequence are
physically impossible. A ship cannot execute a 180-degree turn at full
thrust without either decelerating first or being torn apart by
centripetal force. I have enclosed a diagram illustrating the correct
trajectory. Please pass it along to Mr. Drummond with my compliments.

-- Prof. Arthur Kessler, Department of Physics,
   University of Chicago

[Editor's note: We have forwarded Prof. Kessler's diagram to Mr.
Drummond, who responds: "Tell the professor I appreciate the math
lesson. The ship in the story was fitted with experimental inertial
compensators, which I didn't mention because I was too busy writing
an exciting scene. Also, it's a story." We leave the reader to
adjudicate. -- M.S.]

*

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am a seventeen-year-old girl from Portland, Oregon, and I want to
thank you for publishing Margaret Thornton's stories. I have read every
one of them, and they are the reason I have decided to study biology
in college next year. It matters to see a woman writing science fiction
that is taken seriously, and Mrs. Thornton's work is the best proof
I know that women belong in this field -- both science and science
fiction. Please tell her that she has at least one devoted reader in
the Pacific Northwest.

-- Susan Okada, Portland, Oregon

[Editor's note: Mrs. Thornton has been informed of your letter and
asks us to tell you that she is "deeply honored and slightly
embarrassed." She also suggests you look into the marine biology program
at the University of Washington, which she describes as "excellent." We
wish you every success. -- M.S.]

*

Dear Tales from the Future and Beyond,

You people are out of your minds. Issue #11 had a story about a man
who falls in love with an alien, Issue #10 had a story about robots
demanding civil rights, and Issue #9 had a story about a woman
commanding a starship. I read science fiction for rocket ships and ray
guns, not for this social commentary hogwash. If I want to be lectured,
I'll go to church.

-- Name Withheld, Tulsa, Oklahoma

[Editor's note: We are sorry to have disappointed you and recommend
that you seek out publications more in line with your preferences. We
understand that several excellent magazines cater exclusively to rocket
ships and ray guns. As for women commanding starships: we note that
women commanded factories, hospitals, and military operations throughout
the recent war, and we see no reason why the future should be less
imaginative than the past. -- M.S.]

*

Dear Maxwell,

Happy anniversary! One year of Tales from the Future and Beyond -- and
what a year it has been. I remember when you showed me the dummy for
Issue #1 in your office at Meridian, and I told you it would never last
six months. I have never been happier to be wrong. Here's to the next
twelve issues, and the twelve after that. You've built something special.

-- Howard Clement, Astounding Science Fiction
   (printed with Mr. Clement's permission)

[Editor's note: Thank you, Howard. Coming from you, that means more than
you know. -- M.S.]

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clarke
(Ballantine Books, 1953. 214 pages. $2.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Arthur Clarke has given us a masterpiece, and it is a deeply unsettling
one. "Childhood's End" begins with what appears to be a conventional
alien-invasion narrative -- the Overlords arrive, impose peace on a
warring humanity, and usher in a golden age of prosperity and cultural
achievement -- and then proceeds to dismantle every comfortable
assumption the reader has brought to the story. The golden age, it
turns out, is not an end but a preparation. Humanity is being
shepherded toward a transformation so radical that the species, as we
know it, will cease to exist.

Clarke's prose is characteristically lucid and restrained, and his
ideas are staggering in scope. The final chapters, in which the last
human observer watches the children of Earth transcend into something
beyond individual consciousness, achieve a grandeur that is both
exhilarating and heartbreaking. This is science fiction operating at
its highest level: a novel of ideas that is simultaneously a novel of
profound emotional power.

If you read one book this year, make it this one. It will change what
you think science fiction is capable of.

Rating: Essential.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953. 233 pages. $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Theodore Sturgeon has long been one of the most gifted prose stylists
in the field, and "More Than Human" is his finest work to date. The
novel follows a group of misfits and outcasts -- a telekinetic girl,
a pair of teleporting twins, a baby with superhuman intelligence, and
a simpleton named Lone who serves as the catalyst for their union --
who discover that together they form a composite being greater than
the sum of its parts.

The concept is not new (Olaf Stapledon explored similar territory in
"Odd John"), but Sturgeon's execution is extraordinary. His prose is
lyrical without being precious, his characters are vividly realized,
and his exploration of what it means to be more than individual --
without losing the individual entirely -- is both intellectually
rigorous and deeply humane. The central section, "Baby Is Three," which
originally appeared as a novelette in "Galaxy," is the strongest, but
the framing sections that Sturgeon has added elevate the whole into
something approaching literature.

A beautiful, strange, and essential book.

Rating: Highly Recommended.

THE DEMOLISHED MAN by Alfred Bester
(Shasta Publishers, 1953. 250 pages. $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Alfred Bester's Hugo-winning first novel is a thriller set in a future
where telepathy is common and murder has become almost impossible --
because in a world of mind-readers, how do you plan a killing without
someone picking up the thought? The answer, as Bester constructs it,
is a tour de force of plotting: a cat-and-mouse game between a
ruthless industrialist determined to commit the perfect murder and a
telepathic police detective equally determined to stop him.

The novel crackles with energy. Bester's prose is jagged, jazzy, and
experimental -- he uses typographical tricks, stream-of-consciousness
passages, and visual layouts that push the boundaries of what the
printed page can do. His future society is vividly realized, his
characters are compellingly drawn (particularly the murderer, Ben
Reich, who is one of the great villains in SF), and his pacing is
relentless.

It is not a flawless book -- the romantic subplot is unconvincing, and
the ending relies on a psychological revelation that some readers may
find pat -- but its virtues so far outweigh its flaws that the flaws
become footnotes. This is science fiction as it should be written: with
ambition, intelligence, and the courage to try things that haven't been
tried before.

Rating: Highly Recommended.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
                  A Preview of Issue #14
                      February 1954

================================================================================

Next month, Tales from the Future and Beyond celebrates the most
human of emotions with a special Valentine's issue devoted to love
among the stars.

Romance in science fiction has long been treated as an afterthought --
a subplot wedged between the rocket launches, a reward for the hero
after the aliens have been defeated. We believe it deserves better. Love
is the force that drives us outward -- to cross oceans, to climb
mountains, to leave the planet itself. What happens to love when the
distances are measured in light-years? When the beloved is not human?
When the heart must contend not merely with the ordinary obstacles of
misunderstanding and time, but with the vast, alien, incomprehensible
strangeness of the universe?

Our February issue will explore these questions with six stories that
range from the tender to the tragic, from the familiar to the
genuinely alien:

  - Dr. Vincent Koslov returns with "Binary," the story of two
    astronomers whose love is tested by a discovery that forces them
    to choose between each other and the truth.

  - Cassandra Voss makes her Tales debut with "The Cartography of
    Longing," a lyrical exploration of a woman who maps alien worlds
    and the distances -- both spatial and emotional -- that separate
    her from the man she left on Earth.

  - Theodore Cain gives us "Anniversary," a quiet, devastating portrait
    of a couple marking fifty years of marriage on a colony world where
    time moves differently than it does at home.

  - Rex Drummond proves he has a romantic side in "Starlight Serenade,"
    a swashbuckling tale of a smuggler who risks everything to deliver
    a love letter across enemy lines.

  - Harrison Blackwood offers "The Spectral Bride," a gothic romance
    set aboard a generation ship, in which a man falls in love with a
    woman who may not exist outside his own haunted imagination.

  - Margaret Thornton contributes "Symbiosis," the story of a
    xenobiologist who discovers that the alien organism she has been
    studying has been studying her back -- and that its interest is not
    scientific but something far more personal.

Six stories. Six visions of love in the age of space. Available at
your newsstand on January 25th, 1954.

Don't miss it.
