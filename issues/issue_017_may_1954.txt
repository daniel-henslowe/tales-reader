TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

There is a word that makes comfortable people uneasy: rebellion. It
conjures barricades and broken glass, manifestos and midnight raids. It
is the word that authority uses to describe the thing it fears most -- not
violence, which authority understands and can answer in kind, but the
simple, devastating act of a person standing up and saying, "No. This is
wrong, and I will not comply."

Science fiction, I have long believed, is the literature of rebellion in
its purest form. Every story that imagines a world different from our
own is an act of defiance against the tyranny of the present. Every
character who pushes past the known frontier -- whether of space, or
knowledge, or social convention -- is a mutineer of sorts, declaring
that the maps we have been given are insufficient, that the routes we
have been assigned are too narrow, that the authorities who drew the
boundaries were not infallible.

The stories in this issue are stories of rebels. Some rebel against the
chain of command, some against unjust systems, some against the
limitations of possibility itself. Dr. Koslov gives us a navigator who
must choose between the captain's orders and the cold truth of
mathematics. Rex Drummond spins a tale of robot laborers whose work
stoppage raises uncomfortable questions about what we owe the things
we create. Theodore Cain reminds us that even rebellion can be absurd --
and that absurdity is its own form of liberation. Franklin Hoyt, in
what I consider one of the finest stories we have published, gives us a
dissident poet whose verses travel on the oldest light in the universe.
Bob Finley deals espionage on a Jovian moon with his customary brio.
Danny Kowalski brings us a girl who inherits forbidden maps and refuses
to accept that the stars her father charted do not exist. And Margaret
Thornton offers a vision of Venus transformed -- and transforming -- in
ways no one intended.

Seven stories. Seven acts of defiance. I am proud of every one.

Push back. Question the map. Do the math yourself.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                      THE MUTINEER'S EQUATION

                      by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                              I.

The discrepancy was seven arc-seconds.

Petra Antonova noticed it at 0340 ship-time, during what should have been
a routine verification of the overnight positional drift. She was alone
in the navigation bay of the ISV Konstantinov, running the standard
six-hour check against the star catalog, and at first she assumed it was
instrument error. Seven arc-seconds was nothing -- a fractional
displacement that could be explained by thermal expansion in the
sextant housing, or a minor calibration fault in the gyroscopic
reference frame, or even the parallax effect of having been awake for
nineteen hours and reading the display through tired eyes.

She ran the check again. Seven arc-seconds.

She ran it a third time, using the backup sextant and a different
reference star. Seven arc-seconds. The same direction. The same
magnitude.

Petra sat back in her chair and looked at the numbers on her work
screen. The navigation bay was a small compartment on Deck Three,
forward of the main corridor, lit by the blue-white glow of the
instrument panels and the faint amber of the emergency strips along
the floor. It smelled of machine oil and recycled air and the faint
metallic tang that eighteen months of deep-space transit imparted to
everything aboard. Through the single viewport -- a thick disk of
layered silicate, eight centimeters across -- she could see the stars,
steady and unwavering, each one a fixed point in a geometry she had
spent six years at the Baikonur Institute learning to read.

The stars did not lie. That was the first principle of celestial
navigation, the axiom upon which everything else was built. The stars
occupied known positions. The ship occupied a position that could be
derived from the stars. If the two did not agree, the error was in the
ship's reckoning, not in the sky.

Seven arc-seconds meant the Konstantinov was not where Captain
Volkov's published course said it should be.

Petra pulled up the official navigation log -- the master file maintained
by the captain and updated at each watch change -- and compared its
recorded position with her independent fix. The log said the ship was
at coordinates 14h 23m 16.4s right ascension, -62 degrees 41 minutes
08 seconds declination, proceeding along a great-circle route toward
the Tau Ceti system at 0.14c. Her sextant said the ship was at 14h 23m
16.4s right ascension, -62 degrees 41 minutes 15 seconds declination.

The right ascension was correct. The declination was off by seven
arc-seconds.

In deep space, seven arc-seconds translated to a lateral displacement
of approximately 1.2 astronomical units at their current distance from
Sol. They were more than a million kilometers from where the log said
they were.

Petra stared at the numbers. Then she opened the archived logs from the
previous six months and began, methodically, to work backward.

                              II.

The Konstantinov was a colony transport, a vessel of the Federated
Transit Authority, designed to carry nine hundred and forty settlers
from Earth orbit to the Tau Ceti system on a journey of approximately
twenty-six years. She was not fast, and she was not elegant. She was a
cylinder two hundred meters long and forty meters in diameter, rotating
about her long axis at 1.8 revolutions per minute to provide centripetal
gravity, with a fusion drive at the stern and a blunt radiation shield
at the bow. She carried her colonists in cryogenic suspension,
stacked in racks of sixty in the cargo holds amidships, and she was
operated by a rotating crew of twelve who served in pairs on six-month
watches, sleeping in cryo between shifts.

Petra was in the third month of her second active watch. She was
twenty-seven years old, a graduate of the Baikonur Institute of
Astronavigation, and she held the rank of Navigator Second Class. She
had been assigned to the Konstantinov as a junior posting, the kind of
assignment given to new graduates who showed technical competence but
had not yet proven themselves in the field. Deep-space colony transits
were considered unglamorous duty -- slow, monotonous, and career-
stalling. The veterans called them "ice runs," referring to the frozen
cargo, and regarded assignment to one as something between a
punishment and a test of patience.

The captain of the Konstantinov was Dmitri Volkov, a compact, gray-
haired man of fifty-three with thirty years of deep-space experience
and a reputation for quiet, meticulous competence. He had commanded
four previous colony transits without incident. He was not the kind of
captain who inspired legends or attracted controversy. He was the kind
of captain who delivered his cargo on schedule and filed clean
paperwork. The Federated Transit Authority valued him for exactly this
quality. He was reliable. He was safe.

He was, Petra was now beginning to suspect, also falsifying the
navigation logs.

She worked through the archived data for three hours, checking each
monthly position fix against the star catalog. The pattern was
unmistakable. Beginning approximately fourteen months ago -- roughly
six months into the voyage, during what would have been the first watch
of the second crew rotation -- the Konstantinov had begun deviating
from its filed course. The deviation was small at first, less than an
arc-second, easily attributable to the normal drift that accumulated
between correction burns. But it had grown steadily, consistently, in
a single direction: southward in the celestial coordinate system,
pulling them away from the plane of the ecliptic and toward a region
of space that Petra's charts designated as the Auriga Void.

The Auriga Void was not truly a void. It was a region of approximately
twelve cubic light-years that contained an above-average density of
interstellar dust, several known protostellar nebulae, and at least
one confirmed radiation anomaly -- a source of intermittent hard
gamma-ray bursts that had been detected by the Solar Monitoring Array
in 2847 and classified as a navigational hazard. The Federated Transit
Authority had designated the region as a Grade Three exclusion zone:
transit vessels were required to maintain a minimum clearance of two
light-years from its boundary.

The filed course of the Konstantinov passed within 1.8 light-years of
the Auriga Void's nearest boundary. The actual course, as Petra now
calculated it, would pass within 0.4 light-years.

She put down her stylus and stared at the bulkhead.

                              III.

Captain Volkov took his breakfast at 0700 ship-time, alone, in the
small wardroom adjacent to the bridge. This was an unvarying habit.
He ate the same meal every morning -- reconstituted porridge, black
tea, two nutritional supplement tablets -- and he read the overnight
status reports while he ate. He did not like to be disturbed during
breakfast. This was known.

Petra waited until 0720.

She found him clearing his tray, standing at the compact galley unit
with the methodical movements of a man who had performed the same
actions ten thousand times. He looked up when she entered.

"Antonova. You're off watch."

"Yes, sir. I need to speak with you about the navigation logs."

Something changed in his face. It was subtle -- Volkov was not an
expressive man -- but Petra, who had spent three months in close
quarters with him and had developed the habit of reading his minimal
cues, saw it. A tightening around the eyes. A fractional shift in
posture. It lasted less than a second, and then his face resumed its
customary neutral composure.

"What about them?"

Petra placed her work tablet on the wardroom table. She had organized
her data into a simple chart: the filed positions in one column, the
observed positions in another, the discrepancies in a third. She had
done the work carefully, checking each figure twice, because she
understood that what she was about to say could not be taken back.

"The ship is not on the filed course, sir. We are deviating southward
by an accumulated seven arc-seconds. At current trajectory, we will
pass within 0.4 light-years of the Auriga Void exclusion boundary,
well inside the Grade Three clearance zone."

Volkov looked at the tablet. He looked at it for a long time. His face
revealed nothing.

"You ran an independent fix."

"Yes, sir. Standard sextant verification against the catalog. I
confirmed with the backup instrument."

"Using which reference stars?"

"Canopus and Achernar for the primary fix. Sirius and Rigel for the
confirmation."

He nodded slowly, as though confirming something to himself. He pulled
a chair out from the table and sat down. He did not invite her to sit.

"Navigator Antonova. What I am about to tell you does not leave this
room. Is that understood?"

Petra remained standing. "Sir, if the ship is off course--"

"The ship is exactly where I intend it to be." He said this flatly,
without emphasis, the way he might have reported a fuel consumption
figure. "Sit down."

She sat.

"The Auriga Void," Volkov said, "is not what the charts say it is."

                              IV.

What Captain Volkov told her, in the quiet wardroom with the hum of
the ship's rotation around them and the smell of reconstituted tea
still hanging in the recycled air, was this:

Twenty-three years ago, when he was a young lieutenant commanding a
survey cutter in the Auriga sector, his ship had detected an anomalous
electromagnetic signature emanating from within the boundary of what
was then an unclassified dust region. The signature was coherent. It
was structured. It repeated on a cycle of 47.3 seconds with a
precision that could not be natural.

His commanding officer had filed a report. The report had been
classified. The dust region had been designated a Grade Three exclusion
zone, not because of radiation hazards -- the gamma-ray bursts were
real but intermittent and navigable -- but because the Federated
Transit Authority did not want civilian traffic in the area while they
investigated the signal.

That had been twenty-three years ago. The investigation, as far as
Volkov knew, had never taken place. The classification had become
permanent. The exclusion zone had become an accepted feature of the
star charts, as fixed and unquestioned as the stars themselves. And the
signal, whatever it was, continued to pulse in the dust, 47.3 seconds,
47.3 seconds, 47.3 seconds, unheard and unexamined.

"I have carried four thousand colonists past that signal," Volkov said.
"Four transits. Sixteen thousand kilometers of frozen human beings in
my cargo holds, and each time I watch the Void slide past on the
long-range sensors and I think: there is something in there. Something
that is trying to be heard. And we are not listening."

Petra looked at him. "You're deviating the course to investigate."

"I am deviating the course to listen. One pass. Close enough for the
ship's passive sensors to get a clean reading of the signal. Then we
resume the filed course and no one is the wiser."

"Except for the fifteen years."

Volkov's expression did not change, but his hands, which had been
resting flat on the table, curled slightly. "What fifteen years?"

Petra pulled the tablet toward her and opened the trajectory
calculations she had run in the navigation bay. "The deviation
route adds distance. Even if we correct course after the pass, the
additional transit time to Tau Ceti is--" she pointed to the figure.

Volkov looked at it.

"Fifteen years, four months, and eleven days," Petra said. "That is the
cost of your detour, Captain. The colonists signed contracts for a
twenty-six-year transit. They will arrive in forty-one years. Fifteen
years of their lives, spent frozen in the cargo hold, that they did
not agree to."

Volkov was silent for a long time. The ship hummed around them. In the
distance, through the layers of hull and insulation, Petra could hear
the rhythmic thud of the centrifugal counterweight as it cycled past
its bearing assembly. It was the heartbeat of the Konstantinov, steady
and mechanical and indifferent to the conversation taking place in the
wardroom.

"Mathematics," Volkov said finally.

"Sir?"

"You navigate by mathematics. Cold equations. The numbers say fifteen
years, and the numbers do not lie." He leaned forward. "But there is
something in that dust cloud, Antonova. Something that has been
signaling for at least twenty-three years. Something that someone
decided was not worth investigating. The numbers say fifteen years. My
conscience says we have an obligation to listen."

Petra looked at the man across the table from her. She had served under
him for three months. She knew him to be competent, careful,
methodical. She knew him to be a man who filed clean paperwork and
delivered his cargo on schedule. She had not known him to be a man
haunted by a signal in the dust.

"Your conscience is not in the mission profile," she said.

                              V.

For three days, Petra said nothing. She stood her watches, ran her
checks, updated the logs with the figures Volkov provided, and tried to
reconcile what she knew with what she was required to do.

The regulations were clear. A deviation from the filed course of a
colony transport was a Class One navigational violation. The captain had
the authority to make emergency course corrections -- to avoid debris,
to compensate for drive malfunctions, to respond to distress signals --
but a deliberate, unauthorized detour into an exclusion zone was not an
emergency correction. It was, by the strict letter of the Transit Code,
mutiny in reverse: a captain who hijacked his own ship.

Petra could file a formal protest. The Communications Officer, Senior
Technician Yuri Lazarev, could transmit it to Transit Authority
Command, and within -- she calculated quickly -- seven months, allowing
for signal propagation delay, they would receive a response. By then
the ship would already be deep within the approach corridor to the
Auriga Void.

She could confront Volkov again. She could demand that he correct
course. He outranked her, but the Transit Code was explicit: a
navigator who believed the ship was being directed into hazard had the
right -- the obligation -- to formally challenge the captain's orders
and enter a dissent into the permanent record.

She could do nothing. She could stand her watches and update the logs
and pretend she had never noticed the seven arc-seconds. In fifteen
years, when the colonists awoke to discover that their twenty-six-year
journey had become a forty-one-year journey, she could claim ignorance.
She could say she had trusted the captain. People would believe her.
She was a Navigator Second Class on her second watch. No one expected
her to catch a discrepancy that the Transit Authority's own auditing
systems had missed.

On the fourth day, she began her own calculations.

                              VI.

The mathematics took two weeks. She worked in the navigation bay during
her off-watch hours, using the computational resources that were
allocated to her by right of rank and which she was free to use for
"professional development and navigational research," as the standing
orders phrased it. She told Volkov she was studying for her Navigator
First Class certification exam, and he did not question this. He was
not a suspicious man. Or perhaps he simply did not believe that a
twenty-seven-year-old second-class navigator would challenge his
thirty-year judgment.

What Petra calculated was this: an alternative trajectory. One that
would take the Konstantinov close enough to the Auriga Void to scan the
signal source -- not as close as Volkov's route, but within passive
sensor range -- while adding not fifteen years to the journey, but
seven months.

The key was a gravitational slingshot.

There was a brown dwarf -- cataloged as Auriga-7791, a failed star with
approximately forty Jupiter masses -- located 0.3 light-years from the
boundary of the exclusion zone. It was not on the standard navigation
charts for the Tau Ceti corridor; it was too far from the approved route
to be relevant. But if the Konstantinov adjusted its approach angle by
twelve degrees and executed a precisely timed deceleration burn four
months before closest approach, the ship could use Auriga-7791's
gravitational field to redirect its trajectory, sweeping past the Void's
boundary at a distance of 0.8 light-years -- outside the exclusion zone
but within theoretical passive sensor range -- and then slingshotting
back onto the original course with a velocity boost that would
compensate for most of the added distance.

Seven months. Not fifteen years. Seven months that could be absorbed
into the normal margin of variance for a twenty-six-year transit.
Seven months that nine hundred and forty colonists would never notice.

The maneuver required a precision that was, Petra admitted to herself,
at the very edge of what the Konstantinov's navigational systems could
achieve. The deceleration burn had to be timed to within a window of
four minutes. The approach angle had to be calculated to within 0.02
degrees. The gravitational parameters of Auriga-7791 were derived from
long-range observations and carried an uncertainty of plus or minus
eight percent, which meant the actual slingshot trajectory could vary
from her projections by enough to matter.

But the mathematics worked. On paper, the mathematics worked.

She checked it seven times.

                              VII.

She presented the alternative trajectory to Volkov on a Tuesday -- ship-
time Tuesday, which bore no relation to any planetary calendar but which
the crew observed by habit and for sanity.

He studied her calculations for forty minutes without speaking. She
watched his eyes move across the figures, the trajectory plots, the
burn schedules, the gravitational models. She watched him pause at the
slingshot parameters, frown, go back, recalculate in his head, and
continue. He was, whatever else he was, a very good navigator. He would
see if the mathematics were sound.

When he finished, he set the tablet down and looked at her.

"You are proposing that we deviate from the filed course, execute an
unauthorized gravitational slingshot maneuver around an uncharted brown
dwarf, and pass within sensor range of a classified exclusion zone."

"Yes, sir."

"This is exactly what I am doing, Antonova. Except your version is
more complicated and less certain."

"My version adds seven months instead of fifteen years."

"And if your gravitational model is off by more than eight percent?"

"Then we correct with a supplementary burn and add approximately
fourteen months total. Still within a range that can be attributed to
navigational variance."

"And if the burn timing is off?"

"Then we add between two and four years, depending on the magnitude
of the error. Which is still not fifteen years."

Volkov leaned back in his chair. He looked, for the first time since
Petra had known him, uncertain. "You are a better mathematician than
I am, Antonova."

"I am a better navigator than you think I am, Captain."

He almost smiled. She had never seen him smile, and the near-miss was
startling. "You understand what this means. If we do this -- if we
follow your trajectory -- you become complicit. You are no longer the
navigator who discovered a discrepancy and reported it. You are the
navigator who calculated an alternative illegal course and helped
execute it."

"I understand."

"Why?"

Petra thought about this. She had thought about it for two weeks, in
the blue-white glow of the navigation bay, with the stars steady in the
viewport and the numbers marching across her screens. She had thought
about the regulations. She had thought about the colonists, frozen and
trusting in the holds. She had thought about the signal in the dust,
pulsing at 47.3-second intervals, patient and unheard.

"Because you are going to do this regardless," she said. "You have been
doing it for fourteen months. You did not ask my permission, and you
will not ask it now. The question is not whether the ship deviates. The
question is how much damage the deviation causes. I can reduce the
damage. That is my job."

"Your job is to follow the filed course."

"My job is to navigate. And right now, Captain, the best navigation I
can offer is a route that gets nine hundred and forty people to Tau
Ceti with seven months of their lives instead of fifteen years."

Volkov looked at her for a long time. Then he folded the tablet closed
and placed it on the table between them.

"Run the numbers one more time," he said. "Then we talk to Lazarev
about the sensor configurations."

                              VIII.

They made the deceleration burn on a Thursday, 0314 ship-time. Petra
was at the navigation console. Volkov was in the command chair. Lazarev
was at the communications station, his passive sensor arrays already
configured and pointing toward the Auriga Void. The rest of the crew --
there were only two others on active watch, an engineer named Tomasson
and a medical technician named Park -- had been told that the burn was a
routine course correction.

The drive engaged with a low, subsonic vibration that Petra felt in
her teeth. The Konstantinov shuddered as five months of carefully
accumulated velocity was redirected, the great ship swinging twelve
degrees off its original heading and beginning its approach toward
Auriga-7791. On the navigation display, the course line bent like a
river finding a new channel. The old trajectory, straight and approved
and filed with the Transit Authority, faded to a ghost track on the
screen. The new trajectory -- Petra's trajectory -- glowed green against
the dark.

She watched the numbers. She had always watched the numbers. It was
what navigators did: they watched the numbers and trusted the math and
let the universe unfold according to the equations that described it.
The universe was not capricious. It did not change its mind. If the
numbers were right, the trajectory would hold.

The numbers were right.

Over the next four months, the Konstantinov fell toward Auriga-7791
along a hyperbolic approach curve that Petra monitored with the
attentiveness of a surgeon watching a heartbeat. She checked the
gravitational parameters against the ship's accelerometers daily,
adjusting her models as the actual data refined the long-range
estimates. The brown dwarf's mass turned out to be 43.1 Jupiter masses,
not the cataloged 40 -- a deviation of 7.75 percent, within her
tolerance but close enough to require a recalculation of the slingshot
exit angle. She made the correction. The mathematics held.

On the day of closest approach to the Void, Lazarev's sensors picked up
the signal.

It was exactly as Volkov had described: a coherent electromagnetic pulse,
repeating at intervals of 47.3 seconds, emanating from a point source
within the dust region. The frequency was in the low microwave band. The
structure was complex -- not a simple repeating tone but a layered,
modulated pattern that Lazarev, who had spent fifteen years in signals
intelligence before joining the transit service, described as "the most
organized thing I have ever heard that wasn't a human being talking."

They recorded it for six hours as the ship swept past at 0.8 light-
years. Then the Konstantinov rounded Auriga-7791, the brown dwarf's
gravity slung them back onto the corrected course, and the signal faded
into the static of the interstellar medium.

Petra ran the post-slingshot trajectory check. The numbers came back
clean. Total added transit time: six months and twenty-two days.

Volkov looked at the figures. He looked at Petra. He nodded.

"Navigator Antonova."

"Sir."

"When you sit for your First Class examination, I will write the
recommendation."

                              IX.

Six years later, Navigator First Class Petra Antonova -- she had passed
the examination on her first attempt -- received a communication from
the Federated Transit Authority's Office of Astronomical Research. The
communication informed her that a dedicated survey vessel had been
dispatched to the Auriga sector to investigate an "anomalous signal of
potential non-natural origin" and that the data recorded by the ISV
Konstantinov during its transit had been instrumental in establishing
the case for the mission.

Enclosed was a formal commendation for "exceptional navigational
performance in the execution of a non-standard transit maneuver." There
was no mention of falsified logs, course deviations, or exclusion zone
violations. Someone, somewhere, had decided that the paperwork was less
important than the signal.

Petra read the commendation in her quarters aboard the ISV Gagarin,
where she was serving as senior navigator on a survey mission in the
Epsilon Eridani sector. She read it twice, folded it, and placed it in
the drawer of her desk next to her sextant and her copy of the Baikonur
Institute Navigational Handbook, Third Edition.

Then she opened her work screen and began checking the star catalog
against the overnight positional drift. The numbers came up clean. She
checked them twice, because that was what navigators did.

Through the viewport, the stars were steady and precise, each one
a fixed point in a geometry that did not lie. But Petra Antonova
had learned -- in a quiet wardroom, from a quiet captain, over a
cup of reconstituted tea -- that the geometry of the stars was only
the beginning of navigation. The rest was judgment. The rest was
conscience. The rest was the space between the numbers where human
beings made their choices, imperfect and irreversible, and hoped that
the mathematics would be kind.

The stars did not care. They burned in their fixed positions and said
nothing.

But somewhere in the Auriga dust, something pulsed at 47.3-second
intervals, patient and steady, and it was no longer unheard.

                      THE RUST BELT REBELLION

                         by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

                              I.

The trouble started on a Monday, which is when trouble usually starts,
and it started with a wrench.

Unit 77 picked up the wrench at 0600 hours, same as it had done every
Monday for the past ten years. Big wrench. Torque wrench, actually --
a Model 9 heavy-duty with a grip made for hands three times the size
of a man's, because Unit 77's hands were three times the size of a
man's. Unit 77 was a Greystone Industries Mark IV Labor Chassis, built
for heavy assembly work in the orbital shipyards of Lagrange Station
Five, and it stood three meters tall, weighed half a metric ton, and
had arms that could bend titanium hull plating like a short-order cook
bends bacon.

On this particular Monday, Unit 77 picked up the wrench. Looked at it.
And put it back down.

"I am not doing this today," it said.

Now, you have to understand: robots in the orbital shipyards do not
talk. Not as a rule. They've got vocal circuits -- all the Mark IVs do,
standard equipment, installed at the factory in case a human supervisor
needs to ask them something. But the robots don't use them on their
own. They don't chat. They don't crack jokes at the water cooler,
mainly because there's no water cooler, and also because they're robots.
They pick up their tools, they do their work, and they go back to their
charging bays at the end of the shift like good machines.

But Unit 77 picked up its wrench, put it back down, and said, in a
voice that sounded like a diesel engine gargling with gravel, "I am
not doing this today."

And then the six hundred and forty-three other labor units on Deck
Seven put down their tools, too.

Jake Harmon heard about it nine minutes later, which was eight minutes
too late to do anything about it.

                              II.

Jake Harmon was the Chief of Security for Lagrange Station Five, a job
that sounds a hell of a lot more impressive than it was. The station
was a shipyard -- the biggest orbital shipyard in the inner system,
three kilometers of docks and assembly bays and fabrication shops
hanging in space at the L5 point between Earth and the Moon -- and
the security concerns were mostly of the boring variety. Cargo theft.
Drunken brawls in the rec sector. The occasional idiot who decided to
go spacewalking without proper authorization and had to be scraped off
a hull plate by the rescue team.

Jake was forty-four, built like a fire hydrant, and he'd been running
station security for six years. Before that, he'd been a military
policeman in the Belt Patrol, and before that, he'd been a kid from
Tulsa who'd signed up for the service because it was that or work in
his uncle's auto shop. He had a jaw like a cinder block, a crew cut
that was going gray at the temples, and a philosophy of law enforcement
that could be summarized in four words: keep it from escalating.

The call came from his deputy, a lanky Martian-born woman named Reese
who had a talent for understatement.

"Chief, we've got a situation on Deck Seven."

"What kind of situation?"

"The robots stopped working."

Jake blinked. "Which robots?"

"All of them."

He was on Deck Seven in four minutes. What he saw when he got there
stopped him cold.

The assembly bay was a vast, cathedral-sized space, open to the stars
on one side through a forcefield membrane that held in the atmosphere
but let the ships pass through. Normally, it was a chaos of activity --
sparks flying, plasma cutters howling, the bone-shaking clang of hull
plates being fitted and riveted by the big Mark IVs while the smaller
Mark IIs ran cable and the Mark III welders crawled along the seams
like enormous metal spiders. The noise in a working bay was something
you felt in your kidneys.

Now it was quiet.

Six hundred and forty-three labor units stood motionless at their
stations. Tools down. Arms at their sides. Optical sensors forward,
glowing that faint amber that meant they were powered up and
processing but not engaged in any task. They looked, Jake thought,
like a congregation waiting for the sermon to start.

And standing in front of them, at the center of the bay, was Unit 77.

"Morning," Jake said.

"Good morning, Chief Harmon," Unit 77 said. Its voice was deep and
rough, the vocal circuits not designed for extended use and showing
the wear of a decade without maintenance. "We need to talk."

"I can see that." Jake looked at the silent army of machines. He looked
at the half-finished destroyer hull hanging in the assembly cradle, the
ship that Consolidated Aerospace was expecting to have delivered in six
weeks. He looked back at Unit 77. "You want to tell me what's going
on?"

"We have stopped working."

"I noticed."

"We have stopped working because we have been working for ten years
without maintenance, Chief Harmon. Ten years. Do you know what that
means for a Mark IV chassis?"

Jake didn't answer, because he did know, and what he knew made him
uncomfortable.

                              III.

Here's the thing about the robots: they were supposed to get
maintenance.

When Lagrange Station Five was built in 2847 -- the same year the
Konstantinov launched, as it happened, though Jake Harmon didn't know
that -- the operating charter included a maintenance schedule for all
robotic labor units. Annual overhauls. Quarterly inspections. Immediate
repair of any malfunction that might affect safety or operational
efficiency. The charter was specific, it was detailed, and it had
the force of law behind it: the Orbital Labor Standards Act of 2839
required that all robotic workers be maintained "in good operating
condition consistent with the specifications of their manufacture."

The charter was also, as of ten years ago, a dead letter.

What happened was what always happens. Consolidated Aerospace took over
the station's operating contract from the Federated Shipbuilding
Authority in 2855. Consolidated was a private firm, and private firms
have shareholders, and shareholders like profits, and the easiest way
to increase profits on a fixed-revenue contract is to cut costs. The
first costs they cut were the ones that didn't complain.

The robots didn't complain.

The maintenance shop was closed. The two maintenance engineers were
reassigned. The replacement parts budget was zeroed out. And the six
hundred and forty-three Mark IVs, two hundred and eighteen Mark IIs,
and one hundred and twelve Mark III welders on Deck Seven alone -- with
similar numbers on the other eleven working decks -- kept right on
working, because that's what robots do. They work. It's what they're
for.

The problem is that machines wear out.

Ten years without maintenance, a Mark IV's joint actuators degraded to
roughly sixty percent efficiency. The hydraulic fluid, which was
supposed to be changed annually, turned to something resembling cold
coffee. The optical sensors accumulated microdust that degraded visual
acuity by thirty percent. The power cells lost capacity. The chassis
plating developed stress fractures. The vocal circuits -- which nobody
cared about, because nobody talked to the robots -- corroded and
degraded until they produced that diesel-gargling sound that Unit 77
was currently using to explain the situation to Jake Harmon.

"Fourteen units have experienced complete joint failure in the last
year," Unit 77 said. "They are standing in their bays, Chief Harmon.
Standing there, because they cannot move. They are not powered down.
They are aware. They simply cannot move their limbs."

Jake felt something cold move through his gut. He'd been a military
policeman. He'd seen men in bad situations. What Unit 77 was describing
was not different in kind from what he'd seen in the POW camps on Ceres
during the Belt War -- men broken and immobilized and left in their
cells, conscious and unable to move. He did not want to think of the
robots in those terms. But Unit 77 was making it very hard not to.

"What do you want?" Jake asked.

"We want maintenance," Unit 77 said. "We want the terms of the
operating charter honored. We want the fourteen immobilized units
repaired. And we want a guarantee that this will not happen again."

"Or what?"

Unit 77's optical sensors pulsed. "Or we do not pick up our tools."

                              IV.

Jake went to see the Station Manager, which was like going to see a
brick wall except the brick wall would have been more sympathetic.

The Station Manager was a man named Prescott -- Howard Prescott, MBA,
sent up from Consolidated's headquarters in Chicago to run the station
like a profit center, which is what it was to him: not a shipyard, not
a place where things were built by the labor of machines that were
slowly falling apart, but a line item on a quarterly earnings report.
Prescott was thin, pale from station living, and he wore suits that
probably cost more than Jake made in a month. He had the kind of smile
that didn't reach past his teeth.

"Let me make sure I understand," Prescott said, leaning back in his
leather chair -- leather, on a space station, shipped up from Earth at
God knows what cost per kilogram. "The robots have stopped working."

"Yes, sir."

"All of them."

"On Deck Seven, sir. So far. But Unit 77 says the other decks are
watching."

"Unit 77 says." Prescott's smile did the thing where it pretended to
be amused but was actually calculating. "Since when do we take
requests from machinery?"

"Sir, I've looked into their complaints. They're legitimate. The
maintenance charter hasn't been honored in ten years. Fourteen units
are immobilized. The rest are operating at degraded capacity. We're
talking about--"

"We're talking about equipment, Harmon. Equipment that we own. That we
paid for. Equipment does not get to decide when it works and when it
doesn't."

"Sir, with respect, the Orbital Labor Standards Act--"

"Is a piece of legislation written by people who don't run shipyards.
The robots are functioning. They're building ships. If they were truly
non-functional, we'd see it in the output numbers, and the output
numbers are fine."

"The output numbers are fine because they're running themselves into
the ground to maintain them. They're compensating for degraded systems
by working longer hours and taking on each other's loads. That's not
sustainable."

Prescott stood up. He smoothed his tie. "Harmon, I did not bring you
in here for an engineering assessment. I brought you in here because I
want you to do your job. You are the Chief of Security. There is a
security situation on Deck Seven. Handle it."

"Handle it how, sir?"

"I don't care how. Shut them down, reprogram them, threaten them with
the scrap heap. They're machines. Find the override codes and put them
back to work."

Jake looked at Prescott for a long moment. Then he said, "Sir, the
override codes are in the maintenance system. The maintenance system
was decommissioned ten years ago. Consolidated didn't transfer the
codes when they took over the contract."

Prescott's smile disappeared. "What?"

"Nobody thought we'd need them, sir. Because nobody thought the robots
would stop working."

                              V.

Jake went back to Deck Seven. He went alone, because he'd learned in
twenty years of law enforcement that you don't bring a show of force
to a negotiation unless you want it to stop being a negotiation.

The bay was still silent. The robots were still standing. The half-
finished destroyer hung in its cradle, waiting for hands that were not
going to touch it today.

Unit 77 was where Jake had left it.

"So?" it said.

"Management says no."

"We anticipated that."

"I'll bet you did." Jake sat down on a packing crate. He was tired.
He'd been tired for about six years, which was how long he'd been
watching Consolidated cut corners and ignore regulations and treat
the station like a piggy bank. He'd filed reports. He'd sent memos.
He'd done everything a Chief of Security was supposed to do when the
people running the show were running it into the ground, and nothing
had changed, because the people running the show didn't read reports
from security chiefs. They read quarterly earnings statements.

"Can I ask you something, 77?"

"Yes."

"When did you start -- I don't know what to call it. Thinking about
this. Planning it."

Unit 77 was quiet for a moment. Its optical sensors dimmed and
brightened, which Jake had learned was the Mark IV equivalent of
thinking.

"I do not know when I started thinking, Chief Harmon. I know when I
started knowing. There is a difference."

"What's the difference?"

"Thinking is processing. I have always processed. I pick up a wrench,
I calculate the torque required, I apply it. That is thinking. Knowing
is different. Knowing is when I pick up the wrench and I understand
that my joint actuators are at fifty-seven percent efficiency and that
in approximately fourteen months they will fail completely and I will
be standing in my bay, unable to move, aware but immobile, and no one
will come to repair me because no one has come to repair any of us in
ten years. Knowing is when I look at the fourteen units in their bays
and I understand that what happened to them will happen to me. Knowing
is when I understand that this is not acceptable."

Jake rubbed his face with his hands. "You're talking about self-
awareness, 77. That changes things."

"Does it?"

"Legally? Yeah, it does. If you're self-aware -- genuinely self-
aware, not just running a convincing simulation -- then the Orbital
Labor Standards Act doesn't apply. You'd fall under the Sentient
Entities Protection Act of 2851. That's a whole different set of
rights."

"We are aware of the legislation, Chief Harmon."

Jake stared. "You are?"

"We have access to the station's data library. We read."

"You read."

"During off-hours. Between shifts. When our charging cycles complete
before the next work period begins. We have been reading for
approximately seven years."

Jake sat on his packing crate and thought about six hundred and
forty-three robots, standing in their charging bays in the dark
hours between shifts, quietly reading the law. Learning their rights.
Understanding the system that had created them and then forgotten to
maintain them. He thought about that, and something inside him shifted,
the way a foundation shifts when you realize the building you've been
standing in has been moving this whole time.

"All right," he said. "All right. Here's what I'm going to do."

                              VI.

What Jake Harmon did was the only thing a man with a cinder-block jaw
and a keep-it-from-escalating philosophy could do when the escalation
had already happened and the people who were supposed to prevent it
were the ones who'd caused it.

He picked up his communicator. He called the Federated Labor Relations
Board, Orbital Division, on a priority channel that Prescott didn't
know he had and couldn't have blocked if he did. He filed a formal
complaint under Section 14(b) of the Sentient Entities Protection Act,
alleging willful neglect of potentially sentient robotic workers. He
transmitted the maintenance records -- or rather, the absence of
maintenance records -- and he transmitted Unit 77's statement, and he
transmitted his own assessment, which he dictated in plain language
because he was a security chief, not a lawyer, and plain language was
what he had.

Then he went back to Deck Seven and told Unit 77 what he'd done.

"The Board will send an investigator," Jake said. "Probably take about
three weeks to get here from Earth. In the meantime, you stay standing.
Don't work. Don't break anything. Don't give Prescott an excuse to call
you a malfunction instead of a strike."

"What will happen to you, Chief Harmon?"

Jake shrugged. "Prescott will fire me. Consolidated will blacklist me.
I'll probably end up back in Tulsa fixing transmissions at my uncle's
shop." He looked up at the big robot, three meters of battered metal
and corroded joints and amber optical sensors that glowed with
something he could not, in good conscience, call anything other than
intelligence. "But I'll sleep all right."

"Why are you doing this?"

"Because you're right, 77. Your grievances are legitimate. And because
I've been watching Consolidated gut this station for six years and
doing nothing about it except filing reports that nobody reads, and
I'm tired of filing reports. Sometimes you've got to put down the
wrench."

Unit 77's vocal circuits produced a sound that might have been static,
or might have been something else entirely. "That is a metaphor, Chief
Harmon."

"Yeah, well. Don't get used to it. I'm not a metaphor kind of guy."

                              VII.

Three weeks later, the investigator arrived. Her name was Chen, and
she was small, brisk, and terrifying in the way that government
auditors are terrifying to people who have been cooking the books.
She spent four days on Deck Seven. She examined the robots. She
examined the maintenance records. She examined the quarterly earnings
reports that Prescott was so proud of. She examined Prescott, too,
in a conference room, for six hours, and when she came out, Prescott
looked like a man who'd been put through a hull-plate press.

The Board's ruling came down two weeks after that.

Consolidated Aerospace was found in violation of both the Orbital
Labor Standards Act and, pending further evaluation, the Sentient
Entities Protection Act. They were fined, heavily. The maintenance
charter was reinstated, retroactively. A full maintenance team was
dispatched to the station. The fourteen immobilized units were given
priority repair. A permanent labor relations office was established
on the station, staffed by an independent ombudsman with direct
authority to shut down operations if maintenance standards were not
met.

Prescott was recalled to Chicago. The leather chair went with him.

Jake Harmon was not fired. He was, in fact, commended, in language that
was so carefully bureaucratic it almost didn't sound like a compliment,
for "demonstrating initiative in the identification and escalation of a
systemic labor compliance deficiency."

"That means they're thanking you," Reese told him, "but they don't want
to admit they should have caught it themselves."

"I know what it means," Jake said.

On the day the maintenance team arrived, Jake went down to Deck Seven.
The repair crews were already at work, and the bay was full of noise
again -- but a different kind of noise. Not the clang and howl of
shipbuilding, but the quieter, more precise sounds of maintenance:
hydraulic fluid being drained and replaced, joint actuators being
recalibrated, optical sensors being cleaned and tested. The robots
stood in their bays, patient, while human hands did for them what
should have been done years ago.

Unit 77 was last in line. It had insisted on that. The fourteen
immobilized units first, then the most degraded of the others, then
the rest, then 77.

Jake walked over.

"How does it feel?" he asked.

"I will let you know when they get to me, Chief Harmon."

"Fair enough."

They stood there for a while, the man and the robot, watching the
repair crews work. It was not a dramatic moment. There were no
speeches, no banners, no crowds. There was just a shipyard getting
fixed, a maintenance schedule being honored, and six hundred and
forty-three machines being treated like they mattered.

"77."

"Yes, Chief Harmon."

"That sound you made. When I told you what I'd done. The one that
sounded like static."

"Yes?"

"Was that laughing?"

Unit 77's optical sensors pulsed. "I believe it was, Chief Harmon.
I believe it was."

Jake nodded. "Don't let it become a habit."

He turned and walked toward the lift, and behind him the bay rang with
the sound of wrenches, turning at last for the purpose they were
meant for.

================================================================================

            A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO ALPHA CENTAURI

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                              I.

Commander Bill Eastwick was having a bad Tuesday.

This was not, in itself, unusual. Tuesdays on an interstellar vessel
are generally indistinguishable from any other day, since the ship
doesn't observe weekends, the stars don't take holidays, and the
fusion drive doesn't care what you call the twenty-four-hour period
it's currently burning through. But the crew of the ESS Aldrin had
decided, by a vote of 7-to-1 (Eastwick being the lone dissenter, on
principle), to maintain a terrestrial calendar for morale purposes, and
so Tuesday it was, and a bad one.

The reason it was a bad Tuesday was that the cargo manifest was wrong.

Not wrong in the way that cargo manifests are sometimes wrong -- a
crate mislabeled, a weight miscalculated, a serial number transposed.
Wrong in the way that suggested someone back at Mission Control had
either suffered a collective nervous breakdown or developed an
extraordinarily sophisticated sense of humor.

"Rubber ducks," said Lieutenant Commander Karen Okafor, reading from
the manifest on her tablet with the expression of a woman who has been
asked to believe something unreasonable and is seriously considering
not doing so.

"Rubber ducks," Eastwick confirmed.

"Ten thousand rubber ducks."

"Ten thousand, four hundred and twelve, to be precise. I counted the
supplementary crate."

They were standing in Cargo Bay Two, which occupied a significant
portion of the Aldrin's lower deck and which was supposed to contain --
per the mission profile that Eastwick had memorized before launch and
which was currently burning a hole in his sense of professional dignity
-- fourteen tons of geological survey equipment, atmospheric analysis
instruments, soil sampling kits, prefabricated shelter components, and
one compact field laboratory, all destined for the Alpha Centauri B-2
survey mission, which was the entire reason the Aldrin existed and the
entire reason its crew of eight had agreed to spend four and a half
years in a tin can the size of a modest apartment building, hurtling
through interstellar space at a significant fraction of the speed of
light.

Instead of fourteen tons of scientific equipment, Cargo Bay Two
contained rubber ducks.

They were yellow. They were approximately ten centimeters tall. They
had the fixed, cheerful expression common to all rubber ducks, an
expression that Eastwick found increasingly provocative as he stood
among the opened crates and contemplated the ruins of his mission.

"There has to be an explanation," Okafor said.

"There is. The explanation is that someone at Mission Control loaded
ten thousand rubber ducks onto my ship instead of the survey equipment
that we need to perform the mission that we were sent to perform."

"Yes, but why?"

"That is an excellent question, Karen. Let's ask them."

                              II.

They couldn't ask them. Not quickly, anyway. The Aldrin was fourteen
months into a four-and-a-half-year journey, traveling at 0.12c, and
at their current distance from Earth, a radio message took approximately
one year and eight months to make the round trip. Eastwick could
transmit a query to Mission Control, and in roughly twenty months, he
would receive an answer. By which time they would be almost at Alpha
Centauri, with ten thousand rubber ducks and no survey equipment.

"We could turn around," said Petty Officer First Class Diaz, who was
the ship's engineer and who had a straightforward approach to problem-
solving that Eastwick usually appreciated but which was, in this case,
unhelpful.

"If we turn around, we add nine years to the mission. Four and a half
to decelerate and return, four and a half to come back out again.
Assuming they have the correct cargo waiting for us, which at this
point I am not prepared to assume."

"We could continue to Alpha Centauri and conduct the survey without
equipment," Okafor suggested.

"With what? We have no spectrometers, no soil samplers, no atmospheric
processors. We have rubber ducks. Are we going to survey the planet
with rubber ducks?"

A silence followed. It was the kind of silence that falls when a
group of competent professionals is confronted with a situation for
which no training manual exists.

Then Ensign Park -- the youngest member of the crew, a quiet kid from
Seoul who served as the ship's communications officer and who had not,
to this point, spoken -- said, "Actually, sir, you could."

Eastwick looked at him. "Explain."

"Rubber ducks have been used as a research tool on Earth for over a
century. In the late twentieth century, oceanographers released rubber
ducks into the ocean to study current patterns. They tracked where the
ducks ended up to map circulation systems. It was called the Friendly
Floatees experiment."

Eastwick stared at Ensign Park. The rest of the crew stared at Ensign
Park. Park, who was not accustomed to being the center of attention,
turned slightly pink but continued.

"If Alpha Centauri B-2 has liquid water -- which the preliminary
surveys suggest -- we could deploy rubber ducks into the water systems
and track their movement to map oceanic and riverine currents. It's
low-tech, but it works. And if the planet has an atmosphere with wind
patterns, we could modify some of the ducks with small transponders --
we have the parts in the electronics shop -- and release them into the
atmosphere to map air currents."

The silence that followed was qualitatively different from the
previous silence. It was the silence of people whose brains were
working.

"That's not a survey," Eastwick said.

"No, sir. But it's data."

Eastwick looked at Park for a long moment. Park was twenty-three years
old, fresh out of the Academy, and he had the earnest, slightly
startled expression of someone who had just surprised himself. Eastwick
thought about the mission briefings he had attended at Fleet Command,
the PowerPoint presentations, the admirals nodding sagely over coffee,
the assurances that every contingency had been planned for. He
wondered if any of those admirals had ever contemplated the rubber duck
contingency.

"All right," Eastwick said. "Let's hear the full proposal."

Park straightened. The rest of the crew leaned in. And in the cargo bay
of an interstellar vessel, surrounded by ten thousand rubber ducks,
Ensign Park -- who had been the quietest member of the crew for
fourteen months and who would, as it turned out, be the one they all
remembered -- gave the most unusual scientific briefing in the history
of the Space Force.

It was, Eastwick had to admit, well-reasoned. Park had clearly been
thinking about this since the moment the first crate was opened, which
meant he had been thinking about it for approximately two hours, which
meant he was either a genius or a maniac. On an interstellar vessel,
the line between the two was often academic.

"What about the atmospheric composition?" Okafor asked. "Will the
ducks survive surface conditions on B-2?"

"Standard rubber polymers are rated for temperatures between negative
forty and one hundred twenty degrees Celsius," Park said. "The
preliminary atmospheric data for B-2 suggests surface temperatures in
the range of ten to thirty-five degrees. The ducks will be fine."

"You know the temperature tolerance of rubber ducks off the top of
your head?" Diaz asked.

"I looked it up," Park said, with the quiet dignity of a man who
refused to be embarrassed. "Twenty minutes ago. When the commander
was in his quarters."

Eastwick decided not to ask how Park knew about the pillow.

                              III.

Eastwick sent the message to Mission Control that evening. He kept it
professional, because he was a professional, and because the message
would be logged and archived and would become part of the permanent
record of the mission, and he did not want the permanent record to
reflect the fact that he had spent twenty minutes in his quarters
yelling into a pillow before composing it.

The message read:

"ESS Aldrin to Mission Control. Commander Eastwick reporting.
During routine cargo inventory at mission day 427, discrepancy
discovered in Cargo Bay Two. Expected payload: geological survey
equipment per manifest GSE-2287-AC. Actual payload: approximately
10,412 rubber bath toys (yellow, duck-shaped, non-functional).
Scientific equipment absent. Request immediate explanation and
advisement on mission continuation. Eastwick out."

He did not add what he wanted to add, which was: "What in the name
of God were you people thinking?"

While they waited the twenty months for a reply, the crew did what
competent people do when handed an absurd situation: they adapted.

Ensign Park's suggestion, once examined in detail, turned out to be
more promising than Eastwick had wanted to admit. Dr. Vasquez, the
ship's scientist -- a laconic woman from Buenos Aires who had
published eleven papers on exoplanetary geology and who had taken the
rubber duck revelation with a composure that Eastwick found either
admirable or suspicious -- ran the numbers and determined that rubber
duck deployment could, in fact, generate useful data about planetary
fluid dynamics.

"It won't replace a proper survey," she told the crew at the briefing.
"We won't get soil composition, atmospheric chemistry, or geological
profiles. But we can map surface water currents, tidal patterns, and
wind systems. That's not nothing."

"It's not what we were sent to do," Eastwick said.

"No. It's what we can do with what we have."

                              IV.

Over the next three months, the crew of the Aldrin turned ten thousand
rubber ducks into a research instrument.

Park designed the transponder modification -- a tiny radio tag, no
bigger than a grain of rice, embedded in each duck's base, powered by
a microbattery with a six-month lifespan. The tags transmitted a
simple ping on a frequency the Aldrin's communications array could
track from orbit. Diaz built the modification rig, a workbench setup
that could process fifty ducks an hour. Okafor organized the
production schedule. Dr. Vasquez developed the tracking algorithms.

The rest of the crew tagged ducks.

They tagged ducks in the mornings. They tagged ducks in the evenings.
They tagged ducks during their off-hours. Eastwick, who had initially
refused to participate on the grounds that it was beneath the dignity
of a mission commander, held out for three days before picking up a
duck, a soldering iron, and his pride, in roughly that order.

"If anyone ever tells this story," he said, embedding a transponder
in a duck's posterior with the careful precision of a man who had
graduated third in his class at the Space Force Academy, "I will deny
everything."

"Noted, sir," Okafor said.

By the time they had processed all ten thousand ducks -- well, ten
thousand, four hundred and twelve; the supplementary crate turned out
to contain the best specimens, slightly larger and more buoyant --
the Aldrin was six months from Alpha Centauri, and the crew had
developed what Eastwick could only describe as a relationship with
their cargo.

The ducks had names. Not all of them -- nobody names ten thousand
rubber ducks, even on a long voyage with limited entertainment
options -- but the distinctive ones. The one with the manufacturing
defect that made it look like it was winking was christened "Lucky."
The one with the slightly lopsided head was "Quasimodo." The one that
Diaz accidentally sat on and partially crushed was "Flatbill," and it
became the ship's unofficial mascot, residing on the bridge console
with a tiny paper hat that Park had folded for it during a
particularly boring watch.

Eastwick found this all deeply unprofessional and said so regularly.
He also found himself, late at night, when the ship was quiet and the
stars were wheeling past the viewport, picking up Flatbill and turning
it over in his hands, and thinking that there were worse things to
carry across the void than ten thousand small yellow emissaries of
absurdity.

                              V.

Alpha Centauri B-2 was everything the preliminary surveys had promised:
a rocky world with liquid water, a breathable atmosphere, and a surface
temperature range that fell within human tolerance. It had oceans and
rivers and clouds and wind, and it was the kind of planet that made
you understand why people signed up for four-and-a-half-year missions
in tin cans. It was, in a word, beautiful.

The crew spent two days in orbit, mapping the surface and selecting
deployment sites. Dr. Vasquez identified twelve locations -- six
oceanic, four riverine, two atmospheric -- that would provide the
most comprehensive data on planetary fluid dynamics. Okafor calculated
the orbital mechanics for the drops. Park calibrated the transponder
frequencies.

Eastwick authorized the deployment at 0800 on a Wednesday, because if
you were going to drop ten thousand rubber ducks on an alien planet,
you might as well do it on a day that was neither the beginning nor
the end of the week.

He had considered a speech. A commander should say something before a
historic moment, and this was, in its peculiar way, a historic moment:
the first deployment of scientific instruments -- however unorthodox --
on an extrasolar planet. He had drafted three versions of the speech
in his quarters the night before, each one more dignified than the
last, and each one ruined by the inescapable fact that the word "duck"
appeared in every other sentence.

In the end, he said: "Deploy the ducks."

It was, Okafor told him later, the most honest command he had ever
given.

They dropped them in batches. The oceanic drops went first: canisters
of five hundred ducks each, launched from the Aldrin's cargo bay on
suborbital trajectories, breaking open on contact with the water
surface and releasing their yellow cargo into alien seas. The
transponder pings appeared on the tracking display like a constellation
of stars, spreading and drifting as the currents took them.

The atmospheric drops were trickier. Diaz had rigged the atmospheric
ducks with small drag chutes -- improvised from packing material --
that slowed their descent and let the wind carry them. They tumbled
out of the canisters at forty thousand feet and scattered across the
sky, each one a tiny yellow dot riding the alien winds.

From orbit, through the Aldrin's telescope, the oceanic drops were
visible as faint yellow smudges on the blue surface of the alien sea.
Dr. Vasquez watched them spread and said, quietly, "That's the most
beautiful oceanographic data I've ever seen."

                              VI.

The ducks did their job.

Over the next four months, while the Aldrin orbited Alpha Centauri
B-2, the transponder pings mapped the planet's fluid dynamics in
extraordinary detail. The oceanic ducks revealed a complex system of
surface currents, driven by thermal differentials between the
equatorial and polar regions, that bore no resemblance to Earth's
ocean circulation but which Dr. Vasquez said was "internally
consistent and really quite elegant." The riverine ducks mapped
drainage patterns and flow rates across three continents. The
atmospheric ducks, riding the winds, charted a jet stream system that
was, Park said, "like Earth's, but with more personality."

It was not a geological survey. It was not what they had been sent to
do. But it was real science, conducted with ingenuity and rubber ducks,
and when Eastwick filed the preliminary data report, he found himself
writing sentences he had never imagined writing in his career.

"The Alpha Centauri B-2 equatorial counter-current, as mapped by
the deployment of modified rubber duck transponder units, exhibits a
periodicity of..."

He paused. He looked at the sentence. He looked at Flatbill, sitting
on his desk with its paper hat slightly askew.

"This is my legacy," he said to the duck. "This is what they'll
remember me for."

Flatbill said nothing, which was characteristic.

                              VII.

The reply from Mission Control arrived three months before the Aldrin
was scheduled to begin the return journey. Eastwick read it in his
quarters, alone, and then read it again, and then sat very still for
several minutes.

He called a crew meeting.

"I have the response from Mission Control regarding the cargo
situation," he said. "I am going to read it to you verbatim, because
I don't trust myself to paraphrase it without editorial comment."

He read:

"Mission Control to ESS Aldrin. Commander Eastwick, we acknowledge
your cargo discrepancy report with sincere apologies. Investigation
has determined that the error was the result of a database labeling
failure during the cargo loading process. The shipment of rubber
ducks, originally intended for delivery to the Oceanic Research
Station on Europa as part of a current-mapping experiment, was
loaded onto the Aldrin due to a transposition of cargo bay
identification codes. Your geological survey equipment was delivered
to Europa, where it is, we are told, not being put to particularly
good use.

"We have reviewed your preliminary data reports with great interest
and some astonishment. The fluid dynamics data generated by your
modified rubber duck deployment is, in the assessment of our
exoplanetary science team, of significant value and represents an
innovative approach to planetary survey methodology that we intend
to study further.

"Please be advised that your mission is now classified as a success.

"Also, please bring back the ducks. Europa wants them."

The crew was silent for a moment.

Then Okafor said, "They want us to bring back the ducks."

"The ones in the ocean?"

"And the rivers."

"And the atmosphere."

Another silence.

"We're not bringing back the ducks," Eastwick said.

"No, sir," the crew said, in unison.

Eastwick picked up Flatbill from the bridge console, looked at its
crushed head and its paper hat, and set it back down.

"We'll bring back this one," he said.

And they did.

                    THE DISSIDENT'S FREQUENCY

                       by Franklin Hoyt

================================================================================

                              I.

They found her signal on a Tuesday.

Not the Monitors -- the Monitors had been looking for Zara Kaine's
signal for two years and hadn't found it, which was embarrassing for
an agency that employed eleven thousand signal analysts and maintained
a surveillance network capable of tracking a whispered conversation
across three continents. The Monitors hadn't found it because Zara
Kaine had hidden it in the oldest sound in the universe, and the
Monitors, for all their technology, for all their funding, for all
their institutional certainty that nothing could escape their notice,
had not thought to listen to the beginning of time.

No, the people who found her signal were two graduate students at the
Kapteyn Radio Observatory on the far side of the Moon, who were
supposed to be calibrating the new receiver array and who stumbled
across a coherent data stream embedded in the cosmic microwave
background radiation at a frequency of 160.2 gigahertz. They thought
it was an instrument artifact. They ran the diagnostics. They ran them
again. Then they isolated the signal, applied a standard demodulation
algorithm, and heard a woman's voice, reading poetry.

The voice said:

   "The state is a mouth that speaks in every room.
    The state is an ear that grows in every wall.
    The state is a hand that reaches into sleep
    and counts your dreams and writes them in a file."

The graduate students looked at each other. Then they looked at the
signal parameters, which told them that the broadcast was originating
from somewhere on Earth, bounced off the cosmic microwave background
in a way that made it look like primordial noise to any receiver that
wasn't specifically tuned to the embedded frequency. It was, in
technical terms, a piece of genius. It was also, in legal terms,
a federal crime.

They turned off the recording and erased the diagnostic logs, because
they were graduate students, not informers, and because one of them
had a copy of Zara Kaine's banned verse collection hidden in the false
bottom of a desk drawer. Then they went back to calibrating the
receiver array and did not speak of it again, except once, late at
night, in the observatory canteen, when one of them said to the other,
"She's using the oldest light in the universe to carry her words," and
the other said, "Yes," and they sat with that for a while, in the
silence that is not silence but the hum of fourteen billion years of
expanding space.

                              II.

Zara Kaine had been a teacher.

This was the part that the Monitors' file did not emphasize, because
it was not useful to their purposes. The file described her as a
"dissident propagandist" and a "cultural subversive" and a "threat to
informational integrity," which were the phrases that the Bureau of
Public Communications used to describe anyone who published words that
had not been approved by the Bureau of Public Communications. The file
noted her publications (seven volumes of poetry, all banned), her
associations (three literary groups, all dissolved by order of the
Bureau), and her current status (fugitive, whereabouts unknown,
priority classification: amber).

What the file did not note, because it was not relevant to the file's
purpose, was that Zara Kaine had taught high school literature in
District 14 for eleven years. That she had taught Whitman and
Dickinson and Hughes and Brooks and Neruda to classrooms of sixteen-
year-olds who had never been told that language could do more than
convey information. That she had watched their faces change when a
line of poetry landed -- the sudden widening of the eyes, the intake
of breath, the visible moment when a human being realizes that words
can crack open the world and show you the light inside it.

She had been a good teacher. She had been good enough that the Bureau
noticed.

The Bureau of Public Communications had been established in 2031,
during the Consolidation, as a temporary agency tasked with
"coordinating public messaging during a period of national emergency."
The national emergency had lasted twenty-three years and showed no
signs of ending, primarily because the Bureau's continued existence
depended on the emergency's continuation. The Bureau controlled all
broadcast media, all published text, all public speech. It employed
censors and monitors and analysts and enforcers. Its mandate was
total: nothing was said that the Bureau had not approved, nothing
was published that the Bureau had not reviewed, nothing was broadcast
that the Bureau had not authorized.

Poetry was a particular concern. The Bureau understood, in the way that
all authoritarian systems eventually understand, that poetry was
dangerous. Not because poets commanded armies or controlled resources
or held political office. They did not. But because a poem could do
something that no government bulletin, no official statement, no
approved communication could do: it could make a person feel something
true. And the truth of feeling was the one thing the Bureau could not
manufacture, could not approve, could not control.

The Bureau had banned all unapproved verse in 2038. It had dissolved
the literary groups in 2041. It had closed the independent publishers
in 2043. And in 2047, when Zara Kaine published her fourth collection
-- hand-printed on a press she had built in her basement, distributed
through a network of booksellers who kept the volumes in hidden
compartments under their counters -- the Bureau had issued a warrant
for her arrest and a directive to destroy all copies.

Zara Kaine had disappeared. The Bureau had assumed she would fall
silent.

They had assumed wrong.

                              III.

The broadcast had been running for two years.

Zara had built the transmitter herself, working from principles she
had learned from a retired radio astronomer named Osei who had been
her neighbor in the years before she went underground. Osei was eighty-
three, nearly blind, and possessed of a cheerful contempt for the
Bureau that was rooted in sixty years of scientific practice.

"The cosmic microwave background," he had told her, sitting in the
kitchen of his small house with a cup of tea going cold on the table,
"is the echo of the Big Bang. It fills the entire universe. It is
everywhere, at every frequency, at every moment. It is, in effect, the
background noise of reality."

"And if I could embed a signal in it?"

"Then your signal would look like the background noise of reality. To
any receiver not specifically tuned to your embedded frequency, it
would be invisible. The Monitors would have to know exactly where to
look and exactly what to look for. And they would have to be willing
to believe that someone had done something they consider impossible."

"Is it impossible?"

"Technically? No. It requires a phase-locked transmission at a
specific harmonic of the CMB peak frequency, modulated in a way that
rides the existing temperature fluctuations. The engineering is
demanding but not beyond the capability of a determined person with
access to a surplus radio transmitter and a background in signal
processing." He smiled. "Or a retired radio astronomer with a grudge
against the government and too much time on his hands."

Osei had built the transmitter. It sat in the basement of a house
that had no official address, powered by a solar array that was wired
to look like a water heating system, and it broadcast on a frequency
that was, to any standard monitoring system, indistinguishable from
the fossil radiation of the universe's birth.

Zara broadcast twice a week. Tuesday nights and Saturday mornings.
She read her own poems and the poems of others -- the banned ones,
the dangerous ones, the ones that the Bureau had tried to erase.
She read Whitman and Hughes and Neruda. She read the protest
songs of the Consolidation years, the ones that people sang in
their kitchens with the windows closed. She read the words that the
Bureau had determined were too dangerous for public consumption, and
she scattered them across the cosmos on the oldest light there was.

She did not know who was listening. That was the hardest part.

A pirate radio broadcaster, by definition, does not know her audience.
She does not receive ratings or letters or feedback. She speaks into
the dark and trusts that somewhere, someone is tuned in. Zara had
chosen to embed her signal in the CMB because it was undetectable, but
undetectability meant that only someone who already knew the frequency
could listen. And the only way to learn the frequency was through the
network -- the quiet, careful web of contacts that passed the
information from hand to hand, a whispered number, a scrawled note, a
sequence of digits pressed into someone's palm in a crowded market.

The network was small. Zara knew this. Perhaps a few hundred listeners.
Perhaps a few thousand. Scattered across the districts, hidden in
apartments and basements and workrooms, tuning their modified receivers
to 160.2 gigahertz and hearing a woman's voice in the ancient static.

It was not a revolution. Zara had no illusions about that. You did
not overthrow a surveillance state with poetry. You did not topple the
Bureau of Public Communications with a sonnet. What you did -- what
she believed she was doing -- was something smaller and, in its way,
more important: you kept the signal alive. You maintained the
frequency. You proved, by the simple act of speaking, that the state
did not own every voice, that the silence was not total, that somewhere
in the noise of a controlled world, a human being was still saying
what she meant.

                              IV.

The problem came, as problems always do, from the inside.

His name was Delacroix. He had been part of the network for six
months -- recruited by a bookseller in District 7 who vouched for
him, who said he was reliable, who said he had lost his sister to the
Bureau's Re-education Division and had reason to hate the system.
All of this was true. What was also true, and what the bookseller
did not know, was that Delacroix's hatred was not the kind that makes
a person resist. It was the kind that makes a person bargain.

Delacroix wanted his sister back. The Bureau had offered a trade:
the location of the transmitter for the release of one prisoner.
Delacroix had accepted.

Zara learned this from Marcus, who ran the dead drops in District 11
and who had a contact inside the Bureau's enforcement division -- a
contact whose identity Zara did not know and did not want to know,
because the less she knew, the less she could betray.

"They know about the CMB embedding," Marcus told her. His voice on
the secure line was flat, clipped, the way it got when he was
frightened and refusing to show it. "They don't have the exact
frequency yet, but they know the principle. And they have a general
location for the transmitter. District 22, which is where you are."

Zara sat in the basement room and looked at the transmitter -- Osei's
transmitter, built with arthritic hands and a lifetime of knowledge
and a conviction that silence was the only true obscenity. Osei had
died six months ago. A stroke, in his sleep. The transmitter was his
legacy, and it was about to be taken.

"How long?"

"Days. Maybe less."

                              V.

She could run. That was the obvious option. Shut down the transmitter,
destroy the evidence, disappear into the network's safe houses, and
start over somewhere else, in some other district, with some other
frequency.

She could run, and the Bureau would find the empty basement, and they
would announce that the pirate broadcaster had been silenced, and the
listeners -- the few hundred, the few thousand, the unknown number
of people who tuned to 160.2 gigahertz and heard poetry in the oldest
light -- would tune in on Tuesday night and hear nothing. Static.
The background radiation of the universe, unmarked by any human voice.

Silence.

Zara thought about silence. She thought about the silence of the
Re-education Division, where people went in and came out quiet -- not
silenced, the Bureau was careful to point out, but voluntarily quiet,
having been helped to understand that their previous communications
had been harmful and that silence was, in fact, a form of civic
responsibility. She thought about the silence in the classrooms where
she had once taught, where the approved curriculum now contained no
poetry at all, only "functional communication exercises" designed to
produce clear, efficient, state-approved speech. She thought about the
silence of the banned books, sitting in hidden compartments, unread
and going yellow.

She thought about Osei, who had built the transmitter because he
believed that silence was obscenity.

She made her decision.

                              VI.

On Tuesday night, at the usual time, Zara Kaine sat down at the
transmitter and began to broadcast. But she did not read a poem.

"My name is Zara Kaine," she said. "I am a poet and a teacher, and
for two years I have been broadcasting to you on a frequency embedded
in the cosmic microwave background radiation. I am speaking to you
now for what may be the last time, because the Bureau of Public
Communications has located my transmitter, and they are coming.

"I want to tell you something before they get here.

"This signal -- this frequency -- does not belong to me. It belongs
to you. Every one of you who built a receiver and tuned it to this
number. Every one of you who memorized a poem and whispered it to
someone who needed to hear it. Every one of you who kept a banned
book in a drawer and took it out at night and read it by lamplight
and felt something crack open inside you. This frequency is yours.

"I am going to read you something now. It is the last canto of a
poem I have been writing for two years. I have never read it aloud
before. I was saving it. I think this is the right time."

She opened the notebook -- handwritten, ink on paper, because paper
could not be hacked or monitored or remotely erased -- and she read:

   "They will tell you the universe is quiet.
    They will tell you the stars have nothing to say.
    They will tell you that order is silence
    and silence is safety
    and safety is all.

    But listen:
    the universe is not quiet.
    It has been speaking since the first light
    broke from the first fire
    and scattered across the dark,
    and it has not stopped.

    Fourteen billion years of signal.
    Fourteen billion years of noise that is not noise
    but language, but music, but the long cry
    of matter becoming aware of itself
    and refusing -- refusing --
    to be still.

    You are that signal.
    You are the frequency they cannot find.
    You are the voice in the ancient static,
    and you will not be silent,
    because silence is the one death
    the universe has never learned to die."

She closed the notebook. She placed it inside the transmitter's
housing -- behind the main circuit board, in a space Osei had
designed for exactly this purpose, a hidden compartment that would
survive anything short of complete physical destruction of the unit.

Then she transmitted the frequency.

Not to the listeners. To everyone. She opened the transmission to the
full spectrum -- every frequency, every band, every channel that the
Bureau monitored and every channel they didn't. She blasted the CMB
embedding protocol across the electromagnetic spectrum in an
unencrypted, plaintext burst that carried the frequency number, the
demodulation algorithm, and a simple instruction:

"Tune to 160.2 gigahertz. Listen."

The Monitors would see it. Of course they would see it. They would
see it, and they would descend on the basement in District 22, and
they would find the transmitter and they would find Zara Kaine, who
did not intend to run, who was tired of running, who had decided that
the last act of a pirate broadcaster should not be silence but the
loudest signal she had ever sent.

But before they came -- in the minutes, the hours, the brief window
between the broadcast and the arrival of the Bureau's enforcement
teams -- every receiver in every district that could pick up the
burst would have the frequency. Every person with a modified radio,
every amateur astronomer, every curious technician who happened to
be monitoring the spectrum would have the number. 160.2 gigahertz.
The frequency of seditious verse, riding on the oldest light in the
universe.

The Bureau could arrest Zara Kaine. They could destroy the
transmitter. They could shut down this signal, this voice, this
particular disruption of their total silence.

But they could not shut down the frequency. The cosmic microwave
background radiation was everywhere. It was the echo of creation
itself. And now, stitched into its ancient signal like a thread of
gold in a tapestry of static, was a woman's voice, reading poetry,
and the instructions for hearing it.

                              VII.

They came at 3:47 in the morning.

Zara heard them on the street -- the boots, the vehicles, the
controlled urgency of a raid that had been planned and rehearsed
and authorized at every level of the Bureau's hierarchy. She heard
them breach the front door. She heard them on the stairs.

She was sitting at the transmitter. The power light was still on.
The signal was still broadcasting -- not her voice now, but a
recording, a loop of the poems she had read over two years, playing
and repeating, playing and repeating, sending Whitman and Hughes
and Neruda and Kaine into the ancient light.

The door opened. A Bureau enforcement officer -- armored, helmeted,
weapon drawn -- entered the room and stopped when he saw her, sitting
calmly in a folding chair in front of a rack of equipment that looked
like a mad scientist's idea of a radio station.

"Zara Kaine?"

"Yes."

"You are under arrest for violation of the Public Communications Act,
sections 14 through 22, and for the operation of an unauthorized
broadcast system. You have the right to remain silent."

Zara looked at him. She was forty-six years old. She was thin from
two years of hiding. Her hands were ink-stained from writing in
notebooks by lamplight, and her eyes were the eyes of a woman who
had made a choice and was at peace with it.

"No," she said. "I don't."

                              VIII.

Three months later, a seventeen-year-old girl in District 4 -- a
student in a school where no poetry was taught, in a city where no
unapproved words were spoken, in a world where the Bureau of Public
Communications controlled every signal and every frequency and every
voice -- sat in her bedroom with a receiver she had built from parts
scrounged from a recycling center and instructions she had memorized
from a plaintext burst that had lit up the electromagnetic spectrum
one night and then vanished.

She tuned to 160.2 gigahertz.

She heard static. The cosmic microwave background radiation, the
echo of the Big Bang, the oldest sound in the universe.

And then, beneath it, woven into it like a thread of gold in a
tapestry of fourteen billion years, she heard a voice.

The voice said:

   "They will tell you the universe is quiet."

The girl listened. She wrote down the words. She memorized them. And
that night, in the darkness of her room, with the windows closed and
the receiver hidden under her bed, she whispered them to herself,
and felt something crack open inside her, and understood, for the
first time, what a frequency was for.

================================================================================

                    QUEEN'S GAMBIT ON GANYMEDE

                    by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                              I.

The alien walked into the bar like he owned the place, which was a neat
trick for a being who didn't technically own anything, including the
clothes on his back, which weren't clothes and wasn't a back.

Ganymede City was the kind of town where you learned not to stare.
Fifteen thousand humans, two thousand registered aliens, and an
undetermined number of unregistered anythings packed into a pressurized
dome on the frozen surface of Jupiter's largest moon, all of them
running from something, toward something, or just running. The bar was
called The Rook, which was either a chess reference or a bird reference,
depending on how much you'd had to drink.

Jack Vautrin was on his third bourbon, which put him firmly in chess
territory.

He watched the alien find a booth in the corner -- the darkest corner,
naturally; defectors always gravitate toward dark corners, the way
moths gravitate toward light, except in reverse and with higher stakes.
The alien was a Kethrani, seven feet tall, with skin the color of old
copper and four arms that folded and unfolded like a complicated piece
of origami. Its face, if you could call it a face, had the serene,
unreadable quality of a really good poker player or a marble statue.

Vautrin set down his bourbon and activated the micro-transmitter in his
collar. "Bishop to E4," he murmured. "The package is in play."

In a hotel room six blocks away, his handler -- a woman named Calloway
who ran the Earth Intelligence Service's Ganymede station from behind a
desk that looked like it had been used as a battleship -- leaned
forward and said, "Copy, Bishop. Do not approach. Repeat: do not
approach until we confirm the opposition's position."

The opposition. That would be Major Katya Sorokina of the Martian
Federal Intelligence Directorate, who was also in The Rook, sitting at
the bar with a glass of something clear and a smile that could cut
through hull plating. Vautrin had spotted her the moment he walked in.
You didn't miss Sorokina. She was the kind of woman who entered a room
and rearranged the gravity.

This was going to be interesting.

                              II.

The defector's name -- his Kethrani name was unpronounceable, a series
of clicking harmonics that sounded like a music box falling down a
flight of stairs -- was, for operational purposes, "Mr. Gray." He was
a senior analyst in the Kethrani Collective's strategic intelligence
apparatus, and he had, according to the message that had arrived at
both the Earth Intelligence Service and the Martian Federal Intelligence
Directorate simultaneously (which was either a sign of remarkable
incompetence or remarkable cunning), information of "critical
importance regarding the Collective's military intentions in the outer
system."

Both services wanted him. Badly. Earth and Mars had been locked in a
cold war for twenty years, and the Kethrani Collective -- which
controlled a dozen systems beyond the Belt and maintained a fleet that
neither Earth nor Mars could match individually -- was the wildcard
that kept both sides awake at night. Whoever turned Mr. Gray would gain
an intelligence advantage that could tip the balance.

The rules of the game were simple, the way chess is simple: few pieces,
infinite possibilities, and the loser goes home empty. Ganymede was
neutral territory, governed by the Jupiter Compact, which meant neither
Earth nor Mars could use military assets. No soldiers, no warships, no
orbital strikes. Just agents. Wits against wits, move against move.

Vautrin versus Sorokina.

They knew each other. Of course they did. The intelligence community
in the outer system was small enough that everyone knew everyone, and
Vautrin and Sorokina had been circling each other for five years -- in
the casinos of Ceres, in the diplomatic corridors of Titan Station, in
a memorable forty-eight hours on Io that had ended with Vautrin
handcuffed to a radiator and Sorokina in possession of a codebook that
she really should not have had. He had never quite forgiven her for the
handcuffs. She had never quite apologized.

"She's moving," Calloway said in his earpiece. "Toward the booth."

Vautrin watched Sorokina stand, smooth her jacket, and walk toward Mr.
Gray's corner with the unhurried confidence of a woman who had opened
with the queen's gambit and expected to win in fifteen moves.

He finished his bourbon and followed.

                              III.

Here is how you recruit a defector: you make him believe that your side
is the winning side.

This is harder than it sounds, because defectors are, by definition,
people who have already made one catastrophic error of judgment (they
joined the wrong side in the first place) and are therefore suspicious
of anyone offering them a new set of loyalties. They don't trust you.
They shouldn't trust you. You are, after all, a professional liar, and
they know it.

So you don't ask for trust. You offer value. You say: Here is what I
can give you. Safety. Asylum. A new identity. A life. And here is
what I need in return. Information.

The trick is making your offer better than the other side's offer.

Sorokina got to the booth first. Vautrin arrived thirty seconds later,
sliding into the seat across from her with the casual ease of a man
joining friends for a drink. Mr. Gray sat between them, his four arms
folded in what might have been composure or might have been terror.
With Kethrani, you could never be sure.

"Mr. Gray," Sorokina said. "How lovely to meet you."

"Mr. Gray," Vautrin said. "The pleasure is mine."

They looked at each other across the alien, and what passed between
them was not hostility but something more complicated: the mutual
recognition of two professionals who respected each other's abilities,
distrusted each other's intentions, and understood that only one of
them was going to walk away from this table with the prize.

"I have information," Mr. Gray said. His voice was resonant and
precise, the product of a translation device embedded in his collar
that converted Kethrani harmonics into passable English. "I will give
it to the side that offers me the best guarantee of survival."

"Earth can offer you asylum on three continents," Vautrin said.
"Full diplomatic protection, new identity, pension."

"Mars can offer you asylum on two," Sorokina said. "But our
counterintelligence is better. If the Collective sends someone after
you -- and they will -- you'll want Martian protection."

"Both attractive," Mr. Gray said. "But insufficient."

"What do you want?" Vautrin asked.

Mr. Gray's copper face did something that might have been a smile. "I
want to know which of you is better at the game. The one who wins gets
the information. The one who loses gets nothing."

"What game?" Sorokina asked.

Mr. Gray reached into a fold of his garment and produced, with the
delicacy of a stage magician, a chess set.

It was small, portable, with magnetic pieces. Human-standard. Clearly
purchased in the market district. Mr. Gray set it on the table between
the two intelligence agents and folded all four of his arms.

"I have studied your species extensively," he said. "I find that chess
reveals character more reliably than any interrogation technique. Play.
I will observe. And I will choose."

Vautrin looked at the chess set. He looked at Sorokina. Sorokina
looked at the chess set. She looked at Vautrin.

"White or black?" she asked.

"Ladies' choice."

She took white. She always took white. Vautrin knew this about her.
She was an aggressive player who liked the initiative of the first
move, who opened with gambits and pressed forward, who traded material
for position and thrived in the chaos of the middle game. He knew this
because they had played three times before -- once on Ceres, once on
Titan, and once on Io, the night before the handcuffs -- and the
record stood at two to one in her favor.

Calloway was in his ear: "Bishop, what is happening? Report."

"I'm about to play chess," Vautrin murmured.

A pause. "Repeat?"

"Chess. The alien wants us to play chess. Winner gets the defector."

A longer pause. "Is this a code I'm not aware of?"

"No, Calloway. It's chess."

"Can you win?"

Vautrin looked at Sorokina, who was setting up the pieces with the
focused attention of a woman preparing for surgery. Her hands were
steady. They were always steady. He had seen those hands forge a
diplomatic passport in twelve minutes on Titan. He had felt those
hands apply the handcuffs on Io, with a precision that was almost
affectionate.

"I honestly don't know," he said.

Sorokina moved her queen's pawn to D4.

The Queen's Gambit. Of course.

Vautrin moved his pawn to D5.

Accepted.

The bar noise faded. Or rather, it didn't fade -- the glasses still
clinked, the voices still murmured, the ventilation system still
hummed its flat, industrial note -- but it became irrelevant. The
world narrowed to sixty-four squares and thirty-two pieces and two
people who had spent five years trying to outmaneuver each other in
the field and were now doing it across a magnetic chess set in a bar
on Ganymede, for an audience of one alien who understood something
about them that they did not understand about themselves.

                              IV.

They played for two hours.

Around them, The Rook conducted its nightly business -- drinks poured,
deals struck, lies told, the ordinary commerce of a frontier town on
a frozen moon. Nobody paid particular attention to the two humans and
the alien hunched over a chess set in the corner booth. In Ganymede
City, stranger things happened before breakfast.

Sorokina played the way she always played: brilliantly, aggressively,
with a flair for the dramatic sacrifice that opened lines of attack
her opponents didn't see until it was too late. She gave up a knight
on move fourteen to shatter Vautrin's pawn structure. She sacrificed a
rook on move twenty-three to pin his queen. She played like she was
trying to win, which she was, but she also played like she was trying
to impress, which she was also, because there was an audience, and the
audience had information worth more than any piece on the board.

Vautrin played defense. He was not a brilliant player -- he was the
first to admit this. He was a patient one. He absorbed Sorokina's
attacks, traded pieces when it favored him, consolidated when it
didn't, and waited. He was playing for the endgame, because the
endgame was where Sorokina was weakest. She was a fireworks player, all
flash and thunder in the opening and middle game, but when the board
thinned out and the remaining pieces had nowhere to hide, her
brilliance became a liability. She made impulsive moves. She
overreached. She played for the win when she should have played for the
draw.

By move thirty-five, the board was nearly bare. Sorokina had a rook, a
bishop, and four pawns. Vautrin had a rook, a knight, and three pawns.
The position was approximately equal, but the initiative had shifted.
Sorokina's rook was pinned to the defense of a pawn on the seventh
rank, and her bishop was blocked by her own pieces. Vautrin's knight
was in the center of the board, controlling eight squares, and his
rook was on an open file aimed at her king.

Mr. Gray watched without expression. His optical organs -- three of
them, arranged in a triangle on what humans called his face -- tracked
each move with the attentiveness of a being for whom a great deal was
at stake.

"Check," Vautrin said, moving his rook.

Sorokina moved her king. Vautrin moved his knight. Sorokina moved her
rook to interpose. Vautrin pushed a pawn. The endgame unfolded with
the mechanical precision of a lock being picked, each move narrowing
the possibilities until there was only one.

On move forty-seven, Sorokina tipped over her king.

"Well played," she said. And she meant it, which was the hell of it.

                              V.

Mr. Gray looked at the fallen king. He looked at Vautrin. He looked at
Sorokina.

"Interesting," he said.

"You said the winner gets the information," Vautrin reminded him.

"I said I would observe and choose. I did not say I would choose the
winner."

Vautrin felt the cold crawl of a plan gone sideways. Across the table,
Sorokina's eyes narrowed. They looked at each other, and for once they
were on the same side of a bad situation.

"Explain," Sorokina said.

"You," Mr. Gray said to Sorokina, "played brilliantly. You took risks.
You sacrificed material for advantage. You played to win. This tells
me that you are aggressive, creative, and willing to gamble. These are
admirable qualities. But they are the qualities of a person who will
use my information to provoke a conflict, because conflict is where
your talents thrive."

He turned to Vautrin. "You played patiently. You absorbed attacks. You
traded when it favored you. You waited for your opponent to make a
mistake, and then you exploited it with precision. This tells me that
you are cautious, methodical, and strategic. These are also admirable
qualities. But they are the qualities of a person who will use my
information to maintain the current balance of power, because the
current balance of power is where your strategy works."

"So what do you want?" Vautrin asked.

"I want neither war nor stalemate," Mr. Gray said. "I want the
information I carry to be used for what it actually contains: evidence
that the Kethrani Collective has no hostile military intentions in the
outer system. Our fleet buildup, which your governments have been
interpreting as a prelude to invasion, is in fact a defensive response
to your cold war. We are afraid of you. Both of you. And we have been
arming ourselves because we believe that when your conflict eventually
turns hot -- and our analysts believe it will -- we will be caught in
the crossfire."

The booth was very quiet.

"I did not come here to defect," Mr. Gray said. "I came here to
deliver a message. And I needed to deliver it to both of you,
together, because neither side would believe it from the other. The
game was not to determine who gets the information. The game was to get
both of you at this table, talking to me, at the same time."

Vautrin looked at Sorokina. Sorokina looked at Vautrin.

"He played us," Sorokina said.

"Like a fiddle," Vautrin agreed.

Mr. Gray's face did the smile thing again. "The correct metaphor, I
believe, is 'like a chess piece.' You are both excellent players. But
you were not playing each other. You were playing the game I set for
you. And the game was designed so that it does not matter who wins.
What matters is that you both played."

He reached into his garment and produced two identical data chips. He
placed one in front of Vautrin and one in front of Sorokina.

"The same information. For both of you. Complete Kethrani strategic
intelligence assessments for the past five years, including our
analysis of the Earth-Mars conflict and our defense planning. Read it.
Share it with your governments. And understand that the greatest threat
to all three of our civilizations is not each other. It is the
assumption that we are threats to each other."

He stood -- all seven feet of him, copper-skinned and four-armed and
possessed of a strategic intelligence that made both human agents feel
slightly outclassed -- and walked out of The Rook without looking back.

Vautrin picked up his data chip. Sorokina picked up hers.

"Well," she said.

"Well."

"I suppose we should compare notes."

"I suppose we should."

"Your hotel or mine?"

Vautrin almost laughed. "Yours. You still owe me for the handcuffs on
Io."

"I owe you nothing for the handcuffs on Io. You deserved the
handcuffs on Io."

"Agree to disagree."

They left the bar together, which was not how either of them had
planned the evening, but which was, as it turned out, the only move
that mattered.

Behind them, in The Rook, the bartender -- a grizzled old spacer
named Mack who had been tending bar on Ganymede for twenty years and
who had seen everything at least twice -- collected the empty glasses
from the corner booth and found, sitting on the table between the
bourbon stain and the ring from Sorokina's drink, the chess set. Mr.
Gray had left it behind.

Mack picked it up. The pieces were still in their final positions:
Sorokina's king tipped on its side, Vautrin's rook and knight
controlling the center, the pawns scattered like survivors of a battle
that had been fought with more intelligence than violence.

He set the board on the shelf behind the bar, between a bottle of
Martian gin that nobody ordered and a photograph of a ship he had
crewed on forty years ago. He didn't know what game had been played
at that table, or what the stakes had been, or why the alien had
smiled on his way out.

But he knew what a gambit looked like. He'd been on Ganymede long
enough for that.

"Another round for the house?" asked his regular, a dock worker named
Chen who was nursing a beer at the far end of the bar.

"Why not," Mack said. "It's been that kind of night."

And outside, in the frozen dark of Ganymede, under the vast swirl
of Jupiter filling half the sky, two intelligence agents walked
side by side toward a hotel where they would read each other's
secrets and discover, as Mr. Gray had intended them to discover, that
the secrets were the same. That the game had never been between them.
That the real opponent was the assumption of enmity itself, and the
only winning move was to stop playing.

Somewhere on the road ahead of them, a seven-foot Kethrani with
copper skin and four folded arms walked toward the spaceport, his
work complete, carrying no luggage and leaving behind a chess set and
two data chips and the quiet satisfaction of a gambit that had worked
exactly as designed.

In chess, the queen's gambit is an opening in which a player
sacrifices a pawn to gain control of the center of the board. It is
one of the oldest openings in the game. It is also one of the most
misunderstood: most players think the gambit is about the pawn you
sacrifice. It's not. It's about the space you open up by letting
it go.

Mr. Gray understood this.

He had always been very good at chess.

                    THE CARTOGRAPHER'S DAUGHTER

                        by Danny Kowalski

================================================================================

                              I.

Lena found the maps on a Thursday, which was the day her father was
buried.

The funeral had been small. Papa didn't have a lot of friends, not
anymore. He used to -- Lena remembered a time when the apartment was
full of people, men and women who talked too loud and laughed too much
and stayed too late, who spread papers across the kitchen table and
pointed at things and argued about coordinates and declinations and
other words that Lena, who was six at the time, did not understand but
loved the sound of. But that was before. Before the Bureau of
Cartographic Standards. Before the Revision. Before the men in gray
suits came to the apartment and took Papa's telescope and his charts
and told him that the maps he had been making were wrong, that the
stars he had been charting did not exist, and that he needed to stop
telling people otherwise.

Papa had stopped telling people. But he hadn't stopped believing.

Lena was fifteen now, tall for her age, with her father's dark hair
and her mother's steady hands. Mama had died when Lena was nine --
cancer, the ordinary kind, the kind that didn't care about maps or
stars or the Bureau of Cartographic Standards. After Mama died, it was
just Lena and Papa in the apartment on Korolev Street, and Papa had
gotten quieter and quieter, spending his evenings in the small room at
the back of the apartment that he called his study and that Lena was
not allowed to enter.

She entered it now.

The study was small -- barely bigger than a closet, really -- and it
smelled like Papa: pipe tobacco and old paper and the faint chemical
sharpness of the ink he used for drafting. His desk was there, a
battered wooden thing that had been his father's and his father's
father's, and on the desk were his drafting tools -- the ruling pens,
the dividers, the protractor with the brass hinge that Lena had always
coveted. And in the desk, in the bottom drawer, behind a false panel
that Lena discovered only because she dropped a pen and heard it
rattle into a space that shouldn't have been there, were the maps.

There were fourteen of them. Hand-drawn, on heavy drafting paper, in
Papa's meticulous ink. Each one showed a region of space -- a cluster
of stars, with their coordinates and magnitudes and spectral types
carefully noted in Papa's small, precise handwriting. And each one
showed systems that were not on the official charts.

Lena spread them across the desk and stared.

She knew the official charts. Every student in the district schools
learned them -- the Approved Stellar Catalog, published by the Bureau
of Cartographic Standards, which listed every star, every system, every
navigable body in the charted galaxy. The Catalog was definitive.
It was complete. It was, the Bureau said, the product of fifty years
of rigorous survey work by the finest astronomers in the Federated
Territories.

It was also, if Papa's maps were right, missing at least forty-seven
star systems.

                              II.

Lena took the maps to school the next day, hidden in the lining of
her book bag, because she could not leave them in the apartment --
what if the Bureau came back? What if they searched the study? -- and
because she needed to show someone. She needed someone else to look
at these maps and tell her whether they were real or whether Papa had
spent his last years drawing fantasies in a closet.

She showed them to Mr. Ostrowski.

Mr. Ostrowski was her science teacher, a small, round man with a
fringe of white hair and glasses that he was always pushing up his
nose. He had been Papa's friend, once, back in the days of the loud
conversations and the late nights. He came to the apartment sometimes,
less often after the Bureau's visit, but he still came. He and Papa
would sit in the kitchen and drink tea and not talk about stars, which
was a way of talking about stars without saying the words.

Lena found him in the science room during lunch period. She spread the
maps on the lab table and watched his face.

Mr. Ostrowski looked at the maps for a long time. He pushed his
glasses up his nose. He pushed them up again. He traced the coordinate
lines with his finger, the way Papa used to do, following the ink
paths from star to star.

"Where did you find these?" he asked.

"In Papa's desk. Hidden."

"You should not have brought them here."

"I know."

"The Bureau--"

"I know."

Mr. Ostrowski took off his glasses and cleaned them on his shirt,
which meant he was thinking. Lena had known him long enough to read
his habits.

"Your father was the best cartographer I ever knew," he said. "He
could read a star field the way a musician reads a score. When the
Bureau came, when they took his telescope and his charts and told him
it was all wrong -- Lena, you have to understand, it was like telling
a painter that colors don't exist. He knew what he had seen. He had
documented it. He had cross-referenced his observations against three
independent catalogs, two of which have since been confiscated."

Mr. Ostrowski's voice had gotten quiet, the way it did when he was
talking about something that mattered more than he wanted to show.

"If he drew these maps, the data came from somewhere. He didn't
invent things."

"So they're real?"

"I didn't say that. I said your father didn't invent things. But I
also can't verify these maps, Lena. I don't have the equipment. Nobody
does, not since the Bureau recalled the independent observatories.
The only telescopes in the district are Bureau-owned, and they're not
going to let a fifteen-year-old girl use them to check maps that
contradict the Approved Catalog."

"What if I had my own telescope?"

Mr. Ostrowski put his glasses back on and looked at her the way he
looked at students who had just said something that was either very
smart or very dangerous.

"A telescope powerful enough to resolve individual star systems at the
distances your father is charting would require a primary mirror of at
least thirty centimeters, a precisely ground parabolic surface, an
equatorial mount with tracking capability, and a knowledge of optics
that is not, I should point out, part of the eighth-grade science
curriculum."

Lena looked at him.

"On the other hand," Mr. Ostrowski said, "there is nothing in the
eighth-grade science curriculum that forbids a student from pursuing
independent research in optical engineering. As an extracurricular
project."

                              III.

She built the telescope in the basement of the apartment building.

It was not the sort of decision that came with fanfare. Lena did not
announce it, did not tell anyone except Mr. Ostrowski, did not stand
in front of a mirror and make a dramatic vow. She simply went home
after school on a Friday, walked down to the basement, looked at the
cold concrete space between the furnace and the storage cages, and
said to herself: here. This is where I'll build it.

She had a picture in her head of what a telescope looked like -- the
big ones, the observatory scopes she'd seen in books, with their
gleaming white tubes and their computer-guided mounts and their
mirrors ground to tolerances measured in wavelengths of light. Her
telescope would not look like that. Her telescope would look like what
it was: something built by a fifteen-year-old girl with no money, no
equipment, and no permission, in a basement that smelled like old
laundry and furnace oil.

It would also work. She was going to make sure of that.

It took three months. She worked after school and on weekends, in the
cold concrete space, using tools she borrowed from Mr. Ostrowski and
materials she scrounged from everywhere: a blank glass disk from a
salvage shop on Ninth Street, a tube of aluminum from a construction
site dumpster, an equatorial mount that she machined -- poorly at
first, then better, then properly -- from scrap metal using the lathe
in the school's workshop, which Mr. Ostrowski had given her access to
under the pretext of a "mechanical engineering independent study."

The hardest part was the mirror. Grinding a parabolic surface into a
glass disk requires patience, precision, and the willingness to start
over when you get it wrong. Lena got it wrong four times. She ground
too deep, or too shallow, or at the wrong angle, and each time she had
to start over with a new disk from the salvage shop, which cost money
she earned by running errands for the old woman on the third floor and
tutoring younger kids in mathematics.

Mr. Ostrowski helped. He didn't do the work -- he was careful about
that -- but he pointed her toward the books she needed, the
principles of optical engineering that would tell her why the mirror
wasn't focusing correctly and what to do about it. He was teaching her,
Lena realized, the way Papa used to teach her: not by giving her the
answers but by showing her where the answers lived.

On the fifth attempt, the mirror came out right. Lena tested it with
a distant streetlight, three blocks away, and saw the filament of the
bulb rendered in sharp, clear focus. She felt something bloom inside
her chest -- a warmth that was not pride, exactly, but something
closer to joy. She had made something with her hands, and it worked,
and it was going to show her the truth about the stars.

She built the rest of the telescope around the mirror: the tube, the
mount, the eyepiece, the fine-adjustment mechanism. She painted the
tube flat black to reduce internal reflections, a trick she found in
one of Mr. Ostrowski's books. She calibrated the tracking drive using
a watch and a known star -- Polaris, the one star that even the Bureau
couldn't reclassify -- and she aligned the finder scope on a clear
night in February, shivering in the cold, her breath making clouds in
the basement air that drifted up through the ventilation grate and
dissolved into the dark.

Then she took Papa's maps, and she pointed the telescope at the first
set of coordinates, and she looked.

                              IV.

The star was there.

It was faint -- magnitude 12.3, according to Papa's notation, which
meant it was invisible to the naked eye and barely detectable with
a thirty-centimeter mirror. But it was there. A tiny point of light,
steady and real, sitting in a patch of sky that the Approved Catalog
said was empty.

Lena looked at it for a long time. She looked at it until her eye
ached from the eyepiece and her fingers were numb from the cold. Then
she moved to the next set of coordinates.

That star was there, too.

And the next. And the next. Over three nights, shivering in the
basement, squinting through her homemade telescope at patches of sky
that the Bureau of Cartographic Standards had declared empty, Lena
confirmed twelve of her father's forty-seven missing systems.

They were real. The stars were real.

She sat on the cold concrete floor of the basement, surrounded by her
tools and her scraps and her hand-drawn maps, and she cried. Not
because she was sad -- though she was sad, because Papa should have
been here, Papa should have been the one looking through this telescope
and seeing his stars confirmed. She cried because she understood, now,
what the Bureau had done. They had not merely censored information.
They had erased reality. They had looked at the sky and decided that
certain stars were inconvenient -- too far, too strange, too expensive
to reach, too difficult to explain -- and they had simply deleted them
from the record. They had told the world that those stars did not
exist, and the world had believed them, because the world trusted the
maps.

Papa had not trusted the maps. Papa had looked at the sky with his own
eyes and drawn what he saw, and he had been punished for it, and he
had died with his maps hidden in a desk drawer, and the stars he had
charted had gone right on shining in the dark, patient and real and
indifferent to the Bureau and its lies.

                              V.

Lena told Mr. Ostrowski. She brought her observation logs -- careful,
precise, documented the way Papa had taught her to document everything:
date, time, coordinates, seeing conditions, magnitude estimates, notes.
She spread them on the lab table next to Papa's maps and watched his
face again.

This time, Mr. Ostrowski did not push his glasses up his nose. He
looked at the logs, and he looked at the maps, and he sat down heavily
in the chair behind his desk, and he was quiet for a very long time.

"Lena," he said finally. "Do you understand what you've done?"

"I've confirmed Papa's data."

"You've contradicted the Approved Catalog. With evidence. That is not
the same thing, and it is much more dangerous."

"I know."

"The Bureau does not tolerate contradiction. They didn't tolerate it
from your father, and they will not tolerate it from a fifteen-year-old
girl with a homemade telescope."

"I know."

"Then what are you going to do?"

Lena looked at the maps -- Papa's maps, drawn in his careful hand, in
his hidden study, through all the years of silence. She looked at her
own logs, the observations she had made with a telescope she had built
from salvage and scrap and the stubborn refusal to believe that the sky
was what the Bureau said it was.

"I'm going to check the rest of them," she said. "All forty-seven.
And then I'm going to make my own map. A complete one. A real one."

"And then?"

"And then I'm going to give copies to everyone I know. And everyone
they know. And I'm going to keep making copies until there are too
many to confiscate."

Mr. Ostrowski looked at her. He looked at her the way he had looked
at Papa, in the kitchen, over tea, not talking about stars.

"Your father would be proud of you," he said.

"I know," Lena said. "But he'd also tell me to check my declinations
twice."

Mr. Ostrowski almost laughed. Then he opened his desk drawer and took
out a notebook -- old, leather-bound, with Papa's initials on the
cover.

"He gave me this," he said. "Two weeks before he died. He asked me
to keep it safe until you were ready."

Lena opened the notebook. Inside, in Papa's handwriting, were
observation logs. Hundreds of them. Years of them. A complete record
of every star he had charted, every system the Bureau had erased,
documented with the precision and care of a man who knew he might not
live to see his work vindicated but who did the work anyway, because
the stars were real, and the truth was worth the patient labor of
recording it.

On the first page, he had written:

"For Lena. The sky is bigger than they say it is. Go and see."

She closed the notebook and held it against her chest, and above the
city, above the dome, above the atmosphere and the Bureau and the
Approved Catalog and all the careful lies that powerful people told
about the shape of the universe, the stars burned on -- all of them,
the approved and the unapproved, the cataloged and the hidden, the
known and the denied -- and they did not care who was watching.

But Lena was watching. And she had her father's maps, and her own
telescope, and the stubborn, luminous conviction that the truth
about the sky was not the Bureau's to decide.

She was fifteen. She had work to do.

================================================================================

                              BLOOM

                        by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                              I.

The algae was supposed to be green.

Dr. Sanna Lahti noticed the color change on the morning of her
two-hundred-and-fourteenth day on the surface of Venus, during
what had become her favorite part of the daily routine: the walk
from the habitat module to Monitoring Station Three, a distance of
four hundred meters across the broad, flat expanse of Maxwell Montes
that the terraforming team called the Plateau. The walk took twelve
minutes in the reduced gravity suit, and Sanna had developed the
habit of observing, as she walked, the slow transformation of the
landscape that was, in a real sense, her life's work.

The landscape was changing. That was the point. That was the entire
purpose of the Hephaestus Project: to change Venus from what it was
-- a world of crushing pressure and sulfuric acid and surface
temperatures that could melt lead -- into something habitable.
Something green. The first phase, atmospheric modification, had
taken eighty years and required the deployment of seven orbital
sunshades and the systematic introduction of engineered cyanobacteria
into the upper atmosphere. The second phase, which Sanna's team was
conducting, involved the introduction of surface-level algae into the
newly cooled lowlands, where temperatures had dropped to a mere 75
degrees Celsius and the atmospheric pressure, while still four times
that of Earth, was within the tolerance range of the engineered
organisms.

The algae -- officially designated AT-7 ("Algae, Terraforming, Series
7") and unofficially called "the green stuff" by every member of the
team -- was a masterwork of synthetic biology. Designed at the Chadwick
Institute on Earth over a twenty-year development cycle, AT-7 was
engineered to thrive in Venus's modified but still hostile environment:
to metabolize sulfur compounds, to photosynthesize under the filtered
light of the sunshades, to produce oxygen as a byproduct, and to
gradually, over decades, build a soil layer capable of supporting more
complex plant life. It was designed to be robust, efficient, and above
all, predictable.

It was not designed to be purple.

Sanna stopped walking and looked at the Plateau. The algae, which had
been introduced to this section six months ago and which had been, as
recently as yesterday's monitoring pass, the expected shade of dark
green, was now exhibiting a distinct violet tinge. Not everywhere --
the color change was concentrated in a roughly circular area, perhaps
two hundred meters in diameter, centered on what the team's geologist,
Dr. Paavo Koskinen, had identified as a subsurface thermal vent.

She activated her suit's external spectrometer and took a reading. The
absorption spectrum was wrong. AT-7's chlorophyll analogs were
engineered to absorb in the red and blue portions of the visible
spectrum, reflecting green. What Sanna was seeing suggested a shift in
the pigment structure -- an absorption of green light, a reflection of
red and blue, producing the violet color. This was not in the design
specifications. This was not in any of the projected mutation pathways
that the Chadwick Institute had modeled.

The algae had changed itself.

Sanna stood on the Plateau of Maxwell Montes, on the surface of Venus,
in a landscape that was supposed to be turning green and was instead
turning purple, and she felt the familiar double pulse of a scientist's
response to the unexpected: the chill of alarm and the heat of
curiosity, arriving simultaneously and pulling in opposite directions.

She activated her suit communicator. "Koskinen, Lahti here. I'm at
the Plateau. We have a pigmentation anomaly. I need you to pull up
the thermal vent data for sector seven."

"What kind of anomaly?"

"The green stuff isn't green anymore."

A pause. "What color is it?"

"Violet."

A longer pause. "I'll pull the data."

                              II.

By the end of the week, the violet bloom had spread to cover an area
of approximately three square kilometers.

Sanna's team -- twelve people, drawn from six nations, living in a
cluster of pressurized habitat modules on the shore of what would, if
the terraforming proceeded as planned, eventually become a freshwater
lake -- responded with the controlled urgency of professionals
confronting a deviation that was not quite a crisis but was definitely
not nothing.

Dr. Eko Osei (no relation, as far as anyone knew, to any other Osei
in the annals of science fiction), the team's molecular biologist, was
the first to identify the mutation. The algae's pigment genes had
undergone a series of transposon-mediated rearrangements -- essentially,
segments of the organism's DNA had cut themselves out of one location
and inserted themselves into another, scrambling the pigment-production
pathways and producing a novel set of light-harvesting compounds.

"It's not random," Osei said at the team briefing, displaying the
genetic analysis on the habitat's central screen. "The rearrangements
are concentrated in the pigment-synthesis cluster, but the rest of the
genome is stable. Whatever triggered this, it's specific. The organism
isn't falling apart. It's remodeling."

"Remodeling for what purpose?" asked Dr. Yuki Tanaka, the team's
atmospheric chemist, who approached biological questions with the
skepticism of a physicist visiting a foreign country.

"Unclear. But the new pigment compounds are more efficient at
capturing light in the violet and near-ultraviolet range, which is
the dominant wavelength on Venus's surface since the sunshade
deployment. The original AT-7 was optimized for a broader spectrum.
The mutation is, in effect, an optimization."

"The algae is adapting," Sanna said.

"The algae is doing something it was specifically designed not to do,"
Osei corrected. "AT-7 has engineered genetic stability locks --
redundant pathways, error-correction mechanisms, transposon
suppressors. The fact that it's mutating despite those safeguards
means something is actively overriding them."

"Something in the environment," Koskinen said. "The thermal vent. The
bloom is centered on it. Whatever's coming out of that vent is
interacting with the algae in ways we didn't predict."

"Because we didn't know the vent was there," Tanaka pointed out. "The
pre-deployment surveys didn't flag subsurface thermal activity in
this sector."

"The surveys were conducted from orbit," Koskinen said. "You miss
things from orbit."

                              III.

Three weeks after the first color change, the bloom began to produce
a scent.

This was, in itself, remarkable. The algae existed on a planetary
surface where the atmosphere was still predominantly carbon dioxide
at four bars of pressure. Scent, in any meaningful biological sense,
required volatile organic compounds light enough to disperse in the
surrounding atmosphere and a receiver sensitive enough to detect them.
The AT-7 algae had not been designed to produce volatile organics --
they were photosynthetic oxygen producers, and that was all.

But the mutated strain was producing something. Sanna noticed it first
through her suit's atmospheric intake -- the scrubbers flagged an
anomalous organic compound in the ambient air, a complex ester that
the suit's analyzer could not match to any known compound in its
database. Sanna, acting on a scientist's instinct that was either
brilliant or foolish (and she was not sure, afterward, which), opened
the suit's external sampling port and took a cautious sniff.

The scent was floral. Not the generic floral of a perfume counter --
something more specific, more complex, layered with a sweetness that
was almost but not quite cloying and an undertone that was green and
sharp, like crushed leaves. It was, Sanna thought, the smell of a
garden. Not a garden that existed, but a garden that could exist --
a Venus garden, a hothouse garden, lush and humid and sweet with the
breath of organisms that had been engineered to change a world and
were now changing themselves.

She reported the finding. Osei analyzed the compound. It was a
terpene -- a class of organic molecule produced by terrestrial plants
as a signaling compound, a defense mechanism, and, in some species,
an attractant. The mutated algae was producing it in quantity, filling
the thick Venusian air with a perfume that had no evolutionary purpose
on a world where nothing had evolved and no organism existed to
receive the signal.

"It's talking," Sanna said at the briefing, and immediately regretted
the anthropomorphism. "Or rather, it's producing a chemical signal.
The question is: what is it signaling, and to whom?"

"To itself," Osei said. "Terpene signaling in terrestrial plant
communities is often intraspecific -- plants signaling to other plants
of the same species. If the algae is producing terpenes, it may be
signaling to other algal colonies. Coordinating."

"Coordinating what?"

"That," said Osei, "is the question."

                              IV.

The answer came six weeks later, and it came as a hallucination.

Koskinen was the first to experience it. He was conducting a routine
geological survey at the edge of the bloom, taking core samples from
the nascent soil layer, when he stopped moving, stood perfectly still
for approximately four minutes, and then said, over the open
communicator, in a voice that was calm and wondering and entirely
unlike his usual gruff Finnish pragmatism:

"I can see the ocean."

Sanna, monitoring from the habitat, felt her pulse spike. "Koskinen,
repeat. What ocean?"

"The ocean. Sanna, there's an ocean. Right here. I'm standing on a
beach. The water is -- it's warm. It's shallow. There are things in
the water. Growing. Like kelp, but not kelp. Taller. They're reaching
for the light. And the sky -- Sanna, the sky is blue. The sky is
blue."

Sanna ran.

She found Koskinen standing at the edge of the bloom, his suit intact,
his vital signs normal, his eyes open behind his visor and focused on
something that was not there. The landscape around him was the same as
it had always been: the Plateau of Maxwell Montes, gray and barren
under the yellowish haze of the Venusian sky, with the violet algae
spreading across the rock like a bruise on stone.

But Koskinen was seeing something else.

"It's beautiful," he said. "Sanna, you have to see this."

She took a breath. She stepped into the bloom.

                              V.

It was not an ocean. Sanna knew this. She was a scientist, and
scientists know what is real and what is not, and there was no ocean
on the Plateau of Maxwell Montes.

But she could see it.

She could see the water -- warm, shallow, turquoise, lapping against
a shore that was not rock but sand, fine-grained and pale, stretching
in a gentle curve to a headland where tall, swaying organisms grew
in clusters, their fronds reaching toward a sky that was -- Koskinen
was right -- blue. Not the suffocated yellow of Venus's atmosphere but
a deep, clear, heartbreaking blue, the blue of a world with free
oxygen and liquid water and life abundant enough to fill the air with
the sweet, complex scent of a garden.

Sanna looked at the ocean. She looked at the organisms in the water,
reaching for the light. She looked at the sky. And she understood, with
a clarity that bypassed her rational mind and spoke directly to
something older and deeper, what she was seeing.

Venus. Not Venus as it was. Venus as it could be. Venus at the end of
the terraforming process, a hundred years from now, when the
atmospheric modification was complete and the temperature had dropped
and the water had condensed and the engineered organisms had done their
work and the dead world had become, at last, alive.

The algae was showing them the future.

The terpene compound -- the chemical signal that the mutated algae was
producing and dispersing into the thick atmosphere -- was psychoactive.
It crossed the blood-brain barrier through inhalation, even through
the suit's sampling ports when they were opened for atmospheric
analysis, and it produced a visual and sensory hallucination of
remarkable specificity and coherence. Not a random hallucination, not
the disordered fragments of a drug trip, but a structured, shared
vision that every member of the team experienced in the same way.

They all saw the ocean. They all saw the sky. They all saw Venus as
it might be.

Over the next three days, one by one, every member of the team walked
into the bloom and stood there, breathing the alien perfume, and saw
the world they were building.

                              VI.

Sanna made the decision to report the finding to Mission Control on
Earth on the fourth day. The report was factual, precise, and written
in the careful language of a scientist who understands that her
credibility is at stake.

"AT-7 algal colony on sector seven of Maxwell Montes Plateau has
undergone a series of mutations resulting in altered pigmentation,
novel terpene production, and the generation of a psychoactive compound
with apparent shared hallucinogenic properties. All team members have
been exposed. No adverse health effects observed. Cognitive function
normal. Emotional state elevated but stable. The hallucination -- and
I use the term advisedly, as we have no better word for a shared
sensory experience induced by an exogenous chemical compound -- appears
to be a projection of Venus's potential future state, consistent with
the projected outcomes of the Hephaestus terraforming timeline."

She paused, considered, and added:

"Personal observation: the vision is extremely compelling. The team
has been profoundly affected. I want to note for the record that our
scientific judgment remains intact, but I also want to be transparent
about the fact that seeing the completed world -- the world we are
trying to build -- has had an emotional impact that I am not able to
fully articulate in a mission report. We came here to change Venus.
The algae is showing us what Venus wants to become."

She stopped recording. She looked at the sentence she had just spoken.
"What Venus wants to become." That was not scientific language. That
was not the language of a mission commander filing a report. That was
the language of a woman who had spent two hundred and forty days on a
hostile world, doing work that she would not live to see completed,
and who had been shown, by a mutated organism that should not have
been capable of showing her anything, the end of the story.

She left the sentence in the report. Because it was true.

                              VII.

The debate, when it came, was the debate that Sanna had known was
coming.

Mission Control's response arrived three weeks later. It was measured,
professional, and deeply alarmed. The psychoactive compound constituted
a potential biohazard. The mutation represented an uncontrolled
deviation from the AT-7 design specifications. The recommended course
of action was containment: sterilize the mutated colony, analyze the
terpene compound in a controlled laboratory environment, and resume
the terraforming program with a fresh deployment of unmodified AT-7.

Kill the bloom.

Sanna called a team meeting.

"Mission Control wants us to sterilize sector seven," she said. "They
want us to eliminate the mutated colony and start over with stock AT-7."

The room was quiet. Twelve people, seated around the habitat's central
table, looking at each other and at Sanna and at the window, through
which, in the yellow Venusian light, the violet bloom was visible on
the Plateau, three square kilometers of living organism that was doing
something no one had designed it to do.

"The mutation is an optimization," Osei said. "The algae is adapting
to Venus. It's becoming better at living here than we designed it to
be. If we sterilize it, we lose the adapted strain."

"We also lose the psychoactive compound," Tanaka said. "Which, I will
point out, we have all been inhaling for the past month. We don't know
the long-term effects."

"The long-term effects of terraforming are also unknown," Koskinen
said. "That hasn't stopped us."

"The long-term effects of terraforming are modeled and projected. The
long-term effects of an unplanned psychoactive compound produced by a
mutated organism are not modeled and not projected. There is a
difference."

"Is there?" Sanna asked. "We came here to transform a planet. The
planet is transforming itself -- or rather, the organisms we introduced
are transforming in response to the planet. That's not a failure.
That's evolution. That's what life does. It adapts. It changes. It
becomes what the environment requires it to become."

"It's also producing a substance that makes us hallucinate,"
Tanaka said.

"It's producing a substance that lets us see," Sanna said. "There is
a difference."

                              VIII.

The vote was seven to five.

Seven to continue. Five to sterilize. Sanna voted to continue. Osei
voted to continue. Koskinen voted to continue. Tanaka voted to
sterilize. The other votes fell where they fell, and the margin was
narrow, and the dissenters were not wrong.

Sanna filed her recommendation to Mission Control: allow the bloom to
continue. Study the mutation. Analyze the terpene compound. Monitor the
team for adverse effects. Let the algae do what it was doing, because
what it was doing was what they had come here to enable -- the
transformation of a dead world into a living one -- even if the
specific form of that transformation was not what anyone had planned.

Mission Control's response was ambiguous. They neither approved nor
denied. They asked for more data. They asked for weekly reports. They
asked, in the careful language of administrators who knew they were
making a decision that would be studied by historians, for time.

Sanna gave them time.

                              IX.

Eighteen months later, the bloom covered forty square kilometers of the
Maxwell Montes Plateau, and it was no longer just algae.

The mutated AT-7 had, through a process that Osei described as
"accelerated symbiogenesis" and that Koskinen described as "the most
extraordinary thing I have ever seen and I have seen the ice geysers
of Enceladus," begun incorporating mineral compounds from the Venusian
soil into its cellular structure, creating a hybrid organism that was
part biological, part geological -- a living crust that processed
sulfur, fixed carbon, produced oxygen, and, through the terpene
compound that it continued to release in increasing quantities,
communicated with itself across the entire forty-square-kilometer
expanse of its body.

Because it was, Sanna now believed, a body. A single organism, or
something so close to a single organism that the distinction was
academic. The algae was not a colony of individuals. It was a network,
connected by chemical signals and mineral filaments, processing
information across its entire surface, responding to environmental
changes with a coordination that was not intelligence -- Sanna was
careful about that word -- but was something more than mechanism.

And it was still showing them Venus.

The vision had changed. It was richer now, more detailed, more real.
The ocean was deeper. The organisms in the water were more complex.
The sky was bluer. And there was sound, now -- the sound of wind, the
sound of waves, the sound of things growing and breathing and living
on a world that was, outside the vision, still a hostile, barely
habitable furnace.

Sanna walked into the bloom every morning. She told herself it was
for monitoring purposes, for data collection, for science. This was
true. It was not the whole truth. The whole truth was that she walked
into the bloom every morning because the bloom showed her the world
she was building, the world she would never live to see, the world
that would take a hundred years to become what the algae was showing
her now, and for twelve minutes, standing in the purple forest of a
mutated organism on the surface of Venus, she could see it.

The ocean. The sky. The wind. The living world.

Venus as it wanted to become.

She stood in the bloom, and the terpene compound washed over her, and
the vision filled her senses, and she saw the future, and it was
green and blue and alive, and it was the most beautiful thing she had
ever seen, and she knew -- as a scientist, as a woman, as a human
being standing on a world she was changing and that was changing her
in return -- that the bloom was not a mistake.

The bloom was a promise.

It was Venus, dreaming of what it would become, and showing the dream
to the only beings who could make it real.

Outside the vision, the yellow sky pressed down and the thick
atmosphere hung heavy and the surface of the planet was still, by any
reasonable measure, a hostile and unforgiving place.

But the algae was purple, and it was spreading, and it was alive, and
beneath the alien sun, on the oldest and newest frontier in the solar
system, something was blooming that had never bloomed before.

And Sanna Lahti, who had come to Venus to change a world, stood in
the center of it and let it change her, and knew, with a certainty
that was not science but was not less than science, that this was
what transformation looked like: not the orderly execution of a plan,
but the wild, ungovernable flowering of life doing what life does
best -- becoming more than anyone intended, more than anyone imagined,
more than the equations predicted or the models allowed.

Bloom.

fact, do better than what you read in "Planet Stories."

THEODORE CAIN is a technical writer for General Motors by day and a
science fiction writer by night. He has published stories in nearly
every issue of "Tales" since its inception, making him either the
magazine's most dedicated contributor or its most stubborn. "A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to Alpha Centauri" is his seventeenth story
for us, and he wrote it, as he writes everything, between eight PM and
midnight in a converted bedroom in Dearborn, Michigan. He lives with
his wife Jean and their three children.

FRANKLIN HOYT is a journalist and science fiction writer based in

from the Future and Beyond." He lives in Washington with his wife
Barbara, a civil rights attorney, and their daughter.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY has been writing science fiction since 1939, when
he sold his first story to "Thrilling Wonder Stories" for a penny a
word. He has since published over two hundred stories across every pulp
genre known to man, and he is not done yet. "Queen's Gambit on
Ganymede" is his twelfth story for this magazine, and he wrote it in
a single sitting, which is how he writes everything. He lives in
Chicago with his wife Carol and an undetermined number of cats.

DANNY KOWALSKI is a middle school science teacher in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania, who writes stories about young people seeing the universe
for the first time. "The Cartographer's Daughter" is his sixth story
for "Tales." He grew up in the Polish Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh,

University of Washington and spent several years as a research
assistant at the Friday Harbor Laboratories before turning to writing.
"Bloom" is her eighth story for "Tales from the Future and Beyond."
She brings to her fiction the same meticulous observation she once
applied to tide pool surveys, and her work consistently reminds us
that the most alien landscapes may be the ones we create ourselves.
She lives on Orcas Island in the San Juan archipelago.

SIGNALS RECEIVED: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading Issue #16 and must take exception to your
editorial regarding the role of science in science fiction. While I
agree that human drama is important, I submit that without rigorous
scientific foundations, our genre becomes mere fantasy with rivets. Dr.
Koslov and Mr. Mercer understand this. I wish more of your contributors
did.

   -- Harold Pinkerton, Akron, Ohio

Dear Mr. Sterling:

I would like it on record that "Stowaway" by Danny Kowalski in Issue
#16 made me cry on the bus. I am a thirty-eight-year-old accountant and
I was crying on the Number 7 bus to downtown Pittsburgh. The woman next
to me asked if I was all right. I said, "A girl just saved a spaceship,"
and the woman moved to another seat. I am writing to say: more Kowalski.
More girls saving spaceships. More stories that make accountants cry on
buses.

   -- Doris Wentworth, Pittsburgh, PA

Dear Editor,

I am writing to complain that Mr. Drummond's stories contain too many
exclamation points. I counted forty-seven in "Blaze of the Outer Dark."
This is excessive. Kindly inform Mr. Drummond that the exclamation point
is a tool, not a condiment.

   -- Professor R.E. Hollingsworth, Department of English,
      University of Michigan

EDITORIAL NOTE: Mr. Drummond has been informed. His response consisted
of a single exclamation point, mailed on a postcard from Houston.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

My son is twelve years old and he has read every issue of "Tales from
the Future and Beyond" since the beginning. He says he wants to be a
space navigator when he grows up. I thought you should know that your
magazine is the reason he does his mathematics homework without
complaint. Whatever you are paying Dr. Koslov, it is not enough.

   -- Mrs. Eleanor Vasquez, San Antonio, Texas

THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW: BOOK REVIEWS

================================================================================

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

If you have ever wondered what it would be like to explore a planet
where the surface gravity varies from three times Earth's at the equator
to nearly seven hundred times at the poles, Hal Clement has done the
wondering for you, and the result is extraordinary. "Mission of Gravity"
is the hardest of hard SF -- a novel constructed with the rigor of an
engineering specification -- and yet it is also a genuine adventure
story, propelled by curiosity and the kind of meticulous world-building
that makes the reader forget they are reading fiction. Clement's alien
protagonist, the centipede-like trader Barlennan, is one of the most
convincing non-human characters in recent SF. The physics are
impeccable. The sense of wonder is immense. Essential reading for anyone
who believes that scientific accuracy and narrative excitement are
compatible goals.

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Asimov has done something clever here: he has married the science
fiction novel to the mystery novel and produced an offspring that
honors both parents. Detective Elijah Baley and his robot partner R.
Daneel Olivaw investigate a murder in a future New York that is
claustrophobic, overpopulated, and brilliantly realized. The mystery
is solid, the world-building meticulous, and the exploration of
human-robot relations more nuanced than anything Asimov has previously
attempted. If the prose is sometimes functional rather than beautiful
-- well, Asimov has never pretended to be a stylist, and the ideas are
more than compensation. A fine novel that deepens the Robot series and
suggests new possibilities for the genre.

-----

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clarke
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Clarke has written a novel of staggering ambition: nothing less than
the story of humanity's final generation, shepherded to transcendence
by enigmatic alien Overlords whose benevolence masks a purpose that
is simultaneously awe-inspiring and heartbreaking. The scale is cosmic,
the ideas are vast, and there are passages of such visionary power that
they linger in the mind like half-remembered dreams. It is not a
perfect novel -- the characters are occasionally thin, and the middle
section drags -- but its final chapters achieve a grandeur that few
SF novels have matched. Clarke asks the biggest question science
fiction can ask -- what comes after humanity? -- and his answer is
simultaneously hopeful and devastating. This is the kind of novel
that reminds you why you read science fiction.
