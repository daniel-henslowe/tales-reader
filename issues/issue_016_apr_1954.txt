TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

I have on my desk a globe of the Earth that I keep for moments of
editorial frustration. When a story refuses to cooperate, or a printer's
deadline looms like a freight train in a tunnel, I spin that globe and
let my finger fall where it may. Tashkent. The Azores. A patch of blue
in the middle of the South Pacific. Each time, I am reminded that our
own small planet contains more strangeness than any one lifetime could
catalog — and that the universe beyond contains worlds beyond counting.

This issue of "Tales from the Future and Beyond" is dedicated to those
worlds. We have titled it "Worlds of Wonder," and it is exactly what it
claims to be: seven stories set on seven different worlds, each one as
carefully imagined and as richly realized as any terrestrial landscape.

Cordell Beaumont opens our pages with a breathtaking descent into the
atmosphere of a gas giant, where living continents drift on hydrogen
winds and civilizations ride the backs of sky-whales. It is Beaumont at
his most intoxicating — a feast of color and sensation that will leave
you drunk on strangeness. Dr. Vincent Koslov follows with a story that
is, characteristically, both rigorous and haunting: a world where the
trees are not trees at all, but a planetary computer that has been
running a single calculation for three billion years. I confess that the
implications kept me awake long after I had finished editing it.

Douglas Pemberton reminds us that even in the most exotic corners of the
galaxy, there is no escaping the taxman — and delivers a comedy of such
precise absurdity that I found myself laughing aloud in the office,
alarming my secretary considerably. Theodore Cain gives us a murder
mystery set on a world that never turns, where the city straddles the
line between eternal day and eternal night. Margaret Thornton paints a
world shaped by magnetism the way ours is shaped by gravity, and
discovers wonders in the lightning. Colonel Stanton takes us to the Moon
for a siege that is as tactically authentic as it is suspenseful. And
Bob Finley sends a scout crew to a world without shadows, where the
absence of darkness proves more unsettling than any monster.

Seven worlds. Seven writers. Seven visions of what might be waiting out
there, among the stars we see and the countless more we do not.

Spin the globe. Point your finger. Pick a world.

Yours among the stars,

                    THE CLOUD KINGDOMS OF NEPHELE

                       by Cordell Beaumont

================================================================================

                              I.

The first thing Joaquin Reyes noticed, as the bathyscaphe punctured the
amber ceiling of Nephele's upper atmosphere, was the smell.

It should not have been possible. The cabin was sealed, the air recycled
through charcoal scrubbers and metered out at a precise seventy-eight
degrees and forty percent humidity, and yet the smell came through — or
perhaps the smell was in his imagination, summoned by what his eyes
reported through the convex observation port: a world drenched in color,
in impossible, saturated, singing color, like the inside of a stained-
glass cathedral lit by a sun the size of a dinner plate.

Saffron. The upper atmosphere of Nephele smelled — or seemed to smell,
or demanded that one imagine it smelling — of saffron.

He checked the altimeter. One hundred twelve kilometers above the
nominal cloud deck. The bathyscaphe — a squat, thick-walled titanium
sphere called the Magellan, after the explorer who had circumnavigated
a far smaller ocean — descended at a rate of forty meters per second,
its buoyancy vanes feathered against the hydrogen currents. Through the
port, the sky was a gradient of impossible warmth: gold at the zenith
shading through peach and tangerine to a deep, bruised vermillion at the
horizon, where the curve of the gas giant bent light into bands of color
that had no names in any terrestrial language.

Reyes was a small, dark man with the careful hands of a watchmaker and
the deep-set eyes of someone who had spent too many years staring at
things that most people would never see. He had been born in Veracruz,
had studied atmospheric chemistry at the Sorbonne, had mapped the cloud
structures of three Jovian worlds in the Tau Ceti system, and had never
once — in twenty-seven years of exploration — encountered anything that
prepared him for this.

"Magellan, this is Cloudtop Station," said the voice in his earpiece.
Maren Lindqvist, the mission controller. Swedish. Unflappable. "We're
reading you at one-zero-eight klicks and descending. Telemetry looks
clean. How's the view?"

Reyes pressed his face closer to the port. Below him — below, that
inadequate word — the cloud deck of Nephele spread to every horizon,
and it was alive.

Not metaphorically alive. Not alive in the poetic sense that a
terrestrial sky might be said to be alive with light and weather and
the movement of birds. Alive in the biological sense. Alive in the way
that a forest floor is alive, or a coral reef, or the teeming surface
of a petri dish viewed through a microscope. The clouds of Nephele were
organisms. Kilometers-wide, gossamer-thin organisms that photosynthesized
the light of a distant sun and metabolized hydrogen and helium and trace
compounds into structures of staggering complexity: fronds and filaments
and vast, translucent membranes that caught the light and scattered it
into spectra that shifted with each passing second.

"The view," Reyes said, and paused. He was a scientist. He had been
trained to describe what he observed with precision and restraint. But
what he observed, at this moment, defied the vocabulary of science and
demanded the vocabulary of rapture.

"The view is extraordinary," he said.

                              * * *

At eighty kilometers, the character of the descent changed.

The amber light of the upper atmosphere gave way to something richer and
deeper — a luminosity that seemed to emanate not from the distant sun
but from the clouds themselves, which glowed in shades of rose and coral
and a pale, phosphorescent green that reminded Reyes of the
bioluminescent bays he had swum in as a boy, off the coast of Puerto
Rico, where every stroke of the arm released a swirl of blue-green fire
in the warm black water.

The organisms were denser here. Through the port, he could see
individual structures: great billowing sheets of living tissue, each one
the size of a small country, their surfaces textured with ridges and
valleys and patterns that suggested — no, that unmistakably constituted —
vascular networks. Veins. Arteries. Channels through which fluids of
unknown composition pulsed and flowed, carrying nutrients or signals or
both from one region of the organism to another.

He activated the external sensors. Temperature: minus forty-two Celsius.
Pressure: one point three atmospheres and rising. Composition: hydrogen,
eighty-six percent; helium, twelve percent; methane, ammonia, water
vapor, phosphine, and a catalog of organic compounds that the
spectrometer was still sorting through, printing its results in a
scrolling column of molecular formulae that grew longer with each
passing minute.

"Cloudtop, I'm reading significant organic complexity at eighty klicks.
Amino acid analogues. Lipid structures. Some kind of nucleotide chain
I don't recognize — the spectrometer's flagging it as novel."

"Copy, Magellan. Dr. Reyes, we're seeing the same data up here. Dr.
Okoro wants to know if you're observing any discrete organisms at this
depth, or is it still a continuous biomass?"

Reyes swept the external camera in a slow panorama. The cloud-organisms
stretched in every direction, a living landscape of pulsing, breathing,
glowing tissue. But here and there, moving through the biomass the way
fish move through kelp, he caught glimpses of something else: smaller
organisms, discrete and mobile, trailing filaments of bioluminescent
light as they navigated the vast organic terrain.

"Both," he said. "Continuous biomass, and discrete organisms moving
through it. Some of them are quite large — I'm estimating ten to fifteen
meters for the ones I can see. They appear to be feeding on the cloud
tissue, or perhaps harvesting something from it. The bioluminescence
might be communication."

"Or it might be digestion," said Maren's voice, with the faintest trace
of dry humor.

"Or it might be art," Reyes replied, and he was only half joking.

                              II.

At sixty kilometers, he found the sky-whales.

The word was Reyes's own, coined in the moment of first sighting and
immediately regretted, because it was both too apt and not apt enough.
They were whale-like in the way that a cathedral is house-like: the
basic form was recognizable, but the scale and the elaboration
transcended the comparison entirely.

They were vast. The first one he saw — drifting through a canyon of
cloud-tissue that glowed the color of ripe mango — was three kilometers
long, perhaps four. Its body was a flattened ovoid, tapered at both
ends, its surface a deep, lustrous indigo shot through with networks of
gold and copper that pulsed with rhythmic light. Along its dorsal ridge
ran a series of translucent membranes, each one hundreds of meters tall,
that caught the ambient light and refracted it into cascading rainbows.
Its ventral surface was fringed with tendrils — thousands of them, each
one the diameter of a redwood trunk — that trailed into the cloud-tissue
below and moved with the slow, deliberate grace of a hand reaching into
still water.

It was feeding. Or perhaps it was rooting, in the botanical sense: those
tendrils appeared to penetrate the cloud-tissue and draw something from
it, some sustenance or information or both, in the same way that the
roots of a mangrove draw nourishment from the rich mud of a tidal flat.

As the Magellan descended past it, the sky-whale turned — ponderously,
magnificently, the way a galleon turns in a following sea — and one vast,
dark eye regarded the bathyscaphe with an attention that Reyes felt in
his chest like a chord of music played in a minor key.

"Cloudtop," he said. His voice was steady, but only through an act of
professional discipline. "I have visual contact with a large organism
at sixty klicks. Classification... I'm going to call it a sky-whale
until someone proposes something better. Approximately three to four
kilometers in length. Displaying complex bioluminescent patterns and
what appears to be — I want to be careful here — what appears to be
directed attention toward the bathyscaphe."

A pause. Then Maren's voice: "Define 'directed attention.'"

"It's looking at me," Reyes said simply.

Another pause. "Copy, Magellan. Continue descent at your discretion."

Reyes looked at the sky-whale. The sky-whale looked at Reyes. Between
them, the luminous clouds of Nephele shifted and breathed and glowed,
and the silence was the silence of a conversation that had not yet found
its language.

He continued the descent.

                              III.

There were more of them below. Dozens. Then hundreds.

They moved through the cloud-tissue in patterns that Reyes recognized
from his years of studying terrestrial ocean life: migratory patterns,
feeding patterns, social patterns. They traveled in pods of five to
fifteen individuals, the largest at the center, the smallest — the
calves, if calves they were — sheltered beneath the vast membrane-sails
of the adults. They communicated in light: rapid, complex sequences of
bioluminescent pulse that rippled across their indigo hides like
thoughts made visible, like emotions translated into color.

At fifty kilometers, the cloud-tissue itself began to change. The vast,
continuous sheets of living biomass gave way to something more
structured: terraces and plateaus and overhanging shelves of compacted
organic matter, layered and laminated like geological strata, but alive
— pulsing with the slow, rhythmic metabolism of organisms that measured
their lives in millennia rather than years.

And on these terraces, Reyes saw structures.

Not natural structures. Not the random accumulations of biological
growth. Structures that implied intent. Design. Architecture.

They were built — or perhaps grown, or perhaps both — from the same
organic material as the cloud-tissue, but shaped into forms that
served no obvious biological function: spirals and arches and cantilevered
platforms that jutted out over the abyss like balconies, and on these
platforms, gathered in clusters of varying size, were organisms that
Reyes had not yet seen.

They were smaller than the sky-whales — ten to twenty meters in height,
roughly — and bipedal, or at least bilaterally symmetrical in a way that
suggested bipedalism. Their bodies were elongated and graceful, tapering
from broad, flat heads to narrow, prehensile tails that curled and
uncurled as they moved. They glowed with the same bioluminescent
complexity as the sky-whales, but their light-patterns were faster,
more intricate, more — Reyes searched for the word — more articulate.

They were talking. He was certain of it. Whatever those shifting,
cascading patterns of light meant, they constituted a language — a
language of astonishing bandwidth and subtlety, a language that used
the entire visible spectrum as its alphabet and the surface of the body
as its page.

"Cloudtop," he said, and his voice had gone very quiet. "I believe I'm
looking at a city."

                              * * *

The city — if city it was — occupied a terrace of compacted cloud-tissue
approximately twelve kilometers in diameter. It was situated on the
back of a sky-whale so enormous that Reyes had initially mistaken it
for a feature of the cloud-layer itself: a creature of staggering
dimensions, perhaps twenty kilometers from bow to stern, its hide
encrusted with the accumulated growth of what might have been centuries
or millennia of habitation.

The buildings — Reyes used the word with full awareness of its
inadequacy — rose from the whale's back like the towers of a coral city
rising from a reef. They were organic, translucent, lit from within by
a warm amber glow that suffused the entire settlement with the quality
of a lantern-lit harbor seen from the sea at dusk. Their shapes were
flowing and irregular, governed by the logic of biological growth rather
than the geometry of engineering: spirals predominated, along with
branching, tree-like forms and great parabolic arches that seemed to
grow from the whale's hide like the ribs of an inverted ship.

Among these structures, the inhabitants moved. Hundreds of them. Perhaps
thousands. They moved on foot — if foot was the correct term for the
broad, splayed appendages that gripped the whale's textured hide — and
they moved through the air, launching themselves from the spiraling
towers on membranes that unfolded from their backs like the wings of a
colugo, gliding from structure to structure in long, graceful arcs
that left trails of bioluminescent light in their wake.

Reyes drifted the Magellan to within three hundred meters of the
settlement's edge and cut his engines, allowing the bathyscaphe to hover
on its buoyancy vanes in the warm upwelling currents. He activated every
sensor the ship carried: cameras, spectrometers, magnetometers, acoustic
arrays. He began recording.

For ten minutes, nothing happened. The city went about its business
beneath him, and Reyes cataloged what he could see. What appeared to be
market structures — open platforms where individuals exchanged objects
he could not identify. What might have been workshops — enclosed spirals
from which emerged items of shaped organic material, tools or
ornaments or components of something larger. What could have been a
public gathering — a crowd of several hundred individuals assembled on a
broad platform near the whale's dorsal ridge, their bodies pulsing in
synchronized patterns of light that swept through the crowd like a wave
through a stadium.

A ceremony? A political assembly? A concert?

Then one of them saw him.

                              IV.

It rose from the edge of the settlement on its membrane-wings, spiraling
upward in a tight helix that brought it to the level of the Magellan in
less than a minute. It was fifteen meters tall — taller than the
bathyscaphe itself — and its body was a marvel of biological
engineering: the elongated torso sheathed in a hide that shifted
continuously through shades of indigo and violet, the four upper
limbs — two heavy and powerful, two slender and dexterous — folded
against its chest in a posture that might have signified curiosity, or
caution, or a greeting that Reyes lacked the sensory apparatus to
interpret.

Its face — if that broad, flat, eyeless expanse could be called a face —
turned toward the observation port. Reyes stared at it. It had no eyes.
No features that corresponded to any human conception of a face. But its
entire surface was a display, a canvas of living light, and on that
canvas, patterns formed and dissolved with a rapidity and complexity that
dwarfed anything he had seen in the crowd below.

It was speaking to him.

It was speaking to him in light, in color, in patterns of luminous
information that played across its body like the northern lights
compressed into a space the size of a dinner table, and Reyes could not
understand a single word.

But he understood the intent. He understood it the way you understand
the intent of a hand extended in greeting, or the tilt of a head that
signifies curiosity, or the drawn-back posture that means fear. The
creature's posture, its proximity, the measured pace of its approach, the
quality of the light it displayed — bright, varied, unhurried — all of
it communicated a single, unmistakable message:

Who are you?

Reyes placed his palm flat against the observation port. The gesture was
absurd — a primate's greeting offered to a being that had no eyes, that
communicated in frequencies of light rather than the crude percussion
of sound waves on air molecules — but it was all he had.

The creature paused. The light-patterns on its face-surface slowed,
shifted, reorganized. Then, with a deliberateness that made Reyes's
breath catch in his throat, it extended one of its slender upper limbs
and placed it against the hull of the Magellan, directly opposite
Reyes's palm, separated by six inches of titanium and the entire history
of two unrelated evolutionary lineages.

They remained like that for a long time, the man and the cloud-dweller,
palm to appendage through the skin of the ship, while around them the
city glowed and the sky-whale swam its ancient circuit through the amber
clouds of a world that smelled — or seemed to smell, or demanded that
one imagine it smelling — of saffron and wonder and the rich, sweet
perfume of the utterly unknown.

                              V.

In the days that followed, Reyes descended to the city six more times.

Each descent brought new revelations, new layers of complexity that
unfolded like the petals of an orchid opening in slow motion. The
creatures — he called them the Lamplighters, for lack of a better name,
because their bioluminescent communication was the most salient feature
of their biology and their culture — were not merely intelligent. They
were civilized in a way that suggested antiquity: their architecture was
refined, their social organization elaborate, their technology — if
technology was the right word for the manipulation of biological systems
to serve cultural ends — sophisticated and deeply integrated into their
world.

They cultivated the cloud-tissue. Reyes realized this on his third
descent, when he observed a team of Lamplighters working on one of the
lower terraces, shaping the living biomass with their dexterous upper
limbs and with tools that appeared to be modified organisms — small,
specialized creatures that functioned as cutters, shapers, welders of
biological material. They grew their buildings. They grew their tools.
They grew their art — for art it was, unmistakably: sculptures of
shaped cloud-tissue that glowed with intentional patterns of light,
displayed on platforms throughout the city, contemplated by passersby
who paused and pulsed responses of appreciation or critique.

They tended the sky-whales. This was perhaps the most astonishing
revelation. The relationship between the Lamplighters and the great
creatures on whose backs they built their cities was not parasitic but
mutualistic, a symbiosis of staggering depth and subtlety. The
Lamplighters groomed the whales, removing parasitic organisms from their
hides with practiced efficiency. They guided the whales' migrations
through sequences of light-signals that the whales' own bioluminescent
receptors could read. They fed the whales — or rather, they cultivated
the cloud-tissue that the whales fed upon, tending the vast living
fields of atmospheric biomass the way a farmer tends crops, ensuring
that the whale's migratory circuit always led through regions of
abundance.

In return, the whales provided the Lamplighters with everything: a
substrate for their cities, a vehicle for their migrations, a partner
in a dance of mutualism that might have been evolving for hundreds of
millions of years, since the first proto-Lamplighter had clung to the
hide of the first proto-whale and discovered that the arrangement was
good.

Reyes spent hours floating in the Magellan at the city's edge, watching,
recording, struggling to comprehend. The Lamplighters, for their part,
seemed to accept his presence with a calm curiosity that suggested either
great sophistication or great indifference — and Reyes, who had
encountered both qualities in alien species before, suspected the former.
Small groups would drift up to the Magellan on their membrane-wings,
hover at a respectful distance, and pulse sequences of light at the ship
that grew more complex with each visit, as though they were testing the
range of his comprehension, adjusting their signal to his limitations.

He could not speak their language. He knew this. No human instrument
could reproduce the full-spectrum, full-body bioluminescent displays
that constituted Lamplighter speech. But he could listen, and he could
record, and he could begin — haltingly, imperfectly, with the tools of
a science that had never anticipated anything like this — to decode.

On his sixth descent, he brought a light. A simple handheld torch with a
variable-color LED, the kind used for signaling in deep-atmosphere
operations. He held it up to the observation port and pulsed it: on, off.
On, off. The simplest possible signal. The binary foundation of all
communication.

The Lamplighter who had been hovering nearest — a large individual whose
bioluminescent patterns Reyes had come to recognize, and whom he had
privately named Aurelio, after his grandfather — paused. Its light-
patterns stilled. Then, with exquisite precision, it pulsed back: on,
off. On, off.

Reyes changed the pattern. On, on, off. On, on, off.

Aurelio matched it. On, on, off. On, on, off.

Reyes added a color. Red on, blue off. Red on, blue off.

Aurelio's response was immediate and startling. The creature's entire
body blazed with light — a cascade of color that rippled from head to
tail in a wave of such beauty that Reyes felt tears prick his eyes. And
in the midst of that cascade, clear and unmistakable, was the pattern:
red on, blue off. Red on, blue off.

But embedded within it — layered beneath it, around it, through it —
were harmonics. Variations on the theme. The creature had taken Reyes's
simple binary signal and elaborated it into something that was
simultaneously a response, a greeting, a demonstration, and — Reyes
was almost certain — a joke.

He laughed. Alone in the bathyscaphe, seventy kilometers below the
surface of an alien gas giant, surrounded by a civilization built on the
backs of living mountains, Joaquin Reyes laughed with a joy so pure
and uncomplicated that it surprised him.

"Cloudtop," he said into his microphone. "I think we're talking."

                              VI.

The last descent was the deepest.

Reyes took the Magellan down to forty-five kilometers, below the city,
below the terraces of cultivated cloud-tissue, into a region of the
atmosphere that no probe had previously penetrated. The light here was
different — a deep, pulsing crimson, like the glow of embers in a
banked fire — and the pressure had risen to four atmospheres, pressing
against the hull with an intimacy that Reyes could feel in his teeth.

He had come because of something Aurelio had shown him. On the previous
descent, the Lamplighter had guided Reyes's attention downward, using
light-patterns that Reyes had learned to recognize as directional
indicators. Down. Below. There was something below the city that
Aurelio wanted him to see.

He descended through layers of increasingly dense cloud-tissue, past
organisms of bewildering variety: great floating jellyfish-analogues
that trailed tentacles hundreds of meters long, their bells pulsing
with slow, meditative bioluminescence; schools of darting, fish-like
creatures that moved in formations so precise that they seemed to be a
single organism; vast, amorphous masses of living tissue that clung to
the underside of the cloud-layers like stalactites in a cave, their
surfaces crawling with symbiotic organisms in densities that suggested
entire ecosystems compressed into the space of a city block.

At forty-five kilometers, he found it.

It was a sky-whale. But not like the others. Not like anything he had
seen.

It was old. Reyes knew this immediately, the way you know that a
thousand-year-old redwood is old, or a weathered granite cliff, or the
bones of a dinosaur in a museum. It was old the way the planet itself
was old. Its hide was encrusted with growth so thick and ancient that
it had formed its own geological strata, layer upon layer of accumulated
life, a living record of epochs. Its bioluminescence was dim and slow,
a deep, bass-note pulse that seemed to resonate with the rhythm of the
planet itself.

And it was enormous. Reyes's instruments measured it at sixty kilometers
from nose to tail. Sixty kilometers. It was not an organism. It was a
landscape. It was a continent, drifting through the deep atmosphere on
currents older than memory.

On its back — on its vast, ancient, living back — were the ruins.

Cities. Dozens of them. Cities that dwarfed the settlement Reyes had
visited above, cities whose towers rose kilometers into the crimson
murk, cities whose architectures spoke of ages and styles and
civilizations that had risen and flourished and faded and been built
upon by their successors in a palimpsest of habitation that might have
stretched back millions of years.

The ancient whale carried them all, patient and slow, through the deep
clouds of Nephele, and it would carry them still when the last
Lamplighter had pulsed its final light and gone dark, because the whale
was older than the cities, older than the civilization, older than the
concept of civilization itself, and it would endure.

Reyes stared at it through the port, and the crimson light played
across his face, and the smell — that impossible, imaginary, saffron
smell — filled his nostrils, and he understood something that no
instrument could measure and no report could convey.

He understood that he was in the presence of something sacred.

Not sacred in the religious sense — Reyes was not a religious man — but
sacred in the older, deeper sense: something set apart by its sheer
magnitude, its age, its participation in the fundamental processes of
life on a scale that humbled the human imagination and made all human
achievements seem, by comparison, as fleeting and fragile as a soap
bubble on a summer afternoon.

He sat in the Magellan and he wept, not from sorrow but from the
overwhelming, unbearable beauty of it, and when he was done he wiped
his eyes and activated his recording equipment and began, with the
patient precision of a man who knows that his work will outlast him,
to document what he had found.

                              * * *

The ascent took six hours. Reyes rose through the layers of Nephele's
atmosphere the way a diver rises from the deep: slowly, carefully,
allowing the pressure to equalize, allowing his mind to decompress from
the weight of what he had witnessed. The colors shifted around him as
he rose — crimson to rose to amber to gold — and each layer brought
its own community of organisms, its own ecology, its own contribution
to the vast, interconnected web of life that permeated the atmosphere
of this impossible, magnificent world.

At sixty kilometers, he passed through the city again. The Lamplighters
were waiting for him — a delegation of thirty or forty individuals,
hovering on their membrane-wings in a formation that suggested ceremony.
Aurelio was at their center, pulsing a slow, complex pattern of light
that Reyes did not fully understand but that he recognized, in its
rhythm and its warmth, as a farewell.

He held his LED torch to the port and pulsed his own farewell: the
simple binary pattern with which they had begun, embellished with the
few color-harmonics he had learned in their brief exchanges. On, off.
Red, blue. Thank you, if such a sentiment could be conveyed in such
crude semaphore. Goodbye.

Aurelio's response was a symphony of light that played across its body
for a full thirty seconds: every color, every pattern, every harmonic
that the Lamplighter's biology could produce, compressed into a single,
continuous, luminous utterance that was simultaneously greeting and
farewell, welcome and godspeed, a declaration of kinship across the
vast divide of biology and evolution and the cold, indifferent distances
of space.

Reyes watched until the city fell below him, until the amber clouds
swallowed it, until there was nothing to see but the gold and saffron
of the upper atmosphere and the stars — the patient, indifferent,
beautiful stars — emerging overhead as he rose toward the surface and
the ship that would carry him home.

He carried the light with him. Not the torch in his hand — that was a
simple instrument, LEDs and batteries and a plastic housing — but the
other light, the light that the Lamplighters had given him, the light
of a civilization that had been born in clouds and built its kingdoms
on the backs of whales and spoken in colors that the human eye could
see but the human mind could only begin to comprehend.

He carried it with him, and it was enough.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         SILICON DREAMS

                       by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                              I.

The crystals grew in hexagonal columns, and they were three hundred
meters tall.

Dr. Vera Sokolova stood at the base of the nearest one and placed her
gloved hand against its surface. The material was warm — seventeen
degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature of minus forty — and
through the triple-layered thermal glove she could feel a faint, rapid
vibration, like the hum of a transformer in a utility basement. The
crystal was colorless where she touched it, but six meters up the column
it began to acquire a pale amber tint that deepened as it rose, passing
through honey and cognac to a rich, dark umber at the apex, three
hundred meters above, where the flat hexagonal face caught the
lavender light of Kepler-442's K-type star and scattered it into
faint, prismatic fans.

"Temperature differential confirmed," she said into her suit
microphone. "The thermal gradient is consistent from base to apex. It's
not geothermal — the surrounding regolith is at ambient. The heat
source is internal."

Sokolova stepped back and looked up. The crystal column rose against a
sky the color of a bruise: deep violet overhead, shading to a pale
mauve at the horizon, where the bulk of the planet's primary — a gas
giant seventy times Jupiter's mass — dominated a quarter of the sky,
its bands of brown and cream and rust as sharply defined as the grain
in a slab of polished wood.

Kepler-442b was a moon. Tidally heated, volcanically active, its
surface a mosaic of basalt plains and silicate ridges, its atmosphere
thin but breathable — oxygen-nitrogen, 0.7 bar, produced by chemical
processes that the preliminary surveys had not yet fully characterized.
The crystals had been visible from orbit: vast forests of hexagonal
columns covering approximately eighteen percent of the moon's surface,
concentrated in the equatorial regions where the tidal heating was most
intense.

The survey team had called them trees. The designation was informal,
imprecise, and — as Sokolova was beginning to suspect — fundamentally
wrong.

                              II.

She had arrived on Kepler-442b six weeks ago as the mission's
geochemist. The survey team comprised eight scientists and four support
personnel, housed in a pressurized habitat module on the edge of the
largest crystal forest. Their mandate was straightforward: characterize
the moon's geology, atmosphere, and potential biosignatures. Write the
report. Move on to the next target in the catalog.

The crystals had complicated things.

They were silicon-based. This much was clear from the first
spectrographic analysis: the columns were composed of a silicon-oxygen
matrix doped with trace elements — germanium, arsenic, phosphorus — in
concentrations and configurations that no known geological process could
produce. The matrix was not random. Under the electron microscope, the
silicon-oxygen lattice resolved into a structure of extraordinary
regularity: repeating units of approximately 3.2 nanometers, each unit
consisting of a precise arrangement of silicon and oxygen atoms bonded
in a tetrahedral geometry that Sokolova recognized immediately.

It was a crystal lattice. But it was not the crystal lattice of quartz,
or feldspar, or any naturally occurring silicate mineral. It was
something else.

"It's doped," she had told Vasquez, the mission commander, during the
second week's briefing. "The germanium and arsenic aren't contaminants.
They're placed. Deliberately. In a repeating pattern that's too regular
to be geological and too complex to be accidental."

Vasquez was a practical man, a former naval officer who had transitioned
to the exploration service and who approached alien worlds with the same
methodical calm he had once applied to submarine operations. He looked at
Sokolova's data on the briefing room screen and said, "Placed by what?"

"I don't know. But the pattern is consistent across every sample I've
examined — and I've examined forty-seven samples from twelve different
columns. The same basic lattice structure, the same dopant
concentrations, the same repeating unit. Whatever process creates these
columns, it's not random. It's controlled."

"Biological?"

Sokolova hesitated. Silicon-based life was a theoretical possibility
that had occupied a peculiar position in astrobiology for decades:
plausible in principle, never observed in practice. Silicon could form
long chains and complex structures, as carbon did. It could bond with
oxygen, hydrogen, and a range of other elements. But it was heavier,
less versatile, and its chemistry was sluggish compared to carbon's
exuberant reactivity. The prevailing view was that silicon-based life
was possible but unlikely — a chemical road less traveled, requiring
very specific conditions to emerge.

"Possibly," she said. "But if it's biological, it's unlike any biology
we've encountered. There are no cells. No membranes. No discrete
organisms. The entire column appears to be a single continuous
structure — one piece of silicon-oxygen matrix from base to apex."

"A single organism?"

"Or a single crystal. It depends on your definition of organism."

Vasquez studied the data for another moment. "What about the heat?"

Sokolova nodded. This was the anomaly that troubled her most. The
crystals were warm. Not warm the way a sun-heated rock is warm, which
could be explained by simple thermodynamics. Warm the way a living body
is warm: from the inside, continuously, regardless of external
conditions. She had measured the temperature at intervals along a single
column over a seventy-two-hour period, and the internal temperature had
remained constant to within 0.3 degrees — a stability that implied
active thermoregulation.

Something inside the crystals was generating heat. Something was
maintaining a stable internal temperature against the fluctuations of
the external environment. Something was, in the most basic
thermodynamic sense of the word, alive.

"The heat is metabolic," Sokolova said. "I'm almost certain. There's an
energy source inside the lattice — some kind of chemical reaction,
possibly catalyzed by the dopant elements. The crystals are consuming
something and producing heat as a byproduct."

"Consuming what?"

"I don't know yet."

                              III.

She found out during the fourth week, and the discovery changed
everything.

Sokolova had been drilling core samples from a medium-sized column —
one hundred sixty meters tall, estimated age approximately 1.2 billion
years based on the isotopic ratios in the surrounding regolith. The
diamond-tipped drill bit penetrated the outer cortex of the column
easily enough, but at a depth of two meters it encountered a region of
markedly different structure: the silicon-oxygen lattice became denser,
more complex, and the dopant concentrations increased by a factor of
ten.

She extracted the core and examined it under the electron microscope.
What she saw made her sit very still for a long time.

The inner structure was not merely a crystal lattice. It was a circuit.

The germanium and arsenic dopants were arranged in patterns that Sokolova
recognized from her undergraduate electronics courses: p-type and n-type
semiconductor junctions. Transistors. Logic gates. The basic components
of a computational device, grown in silicon at the atomic level, in
structures of a complexity and miniaturization that exceeded anything
human technology had ever achieved.

She ran the analysis three times. She called in Petrov, the mission's
physicist, and had him run it independently. The results were consistent.

The crystals were not trees. They were not organisms in any conventional
sense. They were processors. Computational matrices. Each column was a
single, vast, integrated circuit, three hundred meters tall and perhaps
a meter in diameter, containing more transistor-equivalents than every
computer on Earth combined.

And there were millions of them.

"They're connected," Petrov said, two days later, staring at the data
from the ground-penetrating radar survey. "Look at the root structures."

Sokolova looked. Beneath the surface, the columns were linked. A network
of silicon filaments — thinner than human hair, but composed of the
same doped semiconductor material — radiated from the base of each
column and connected it to its neighbors in a web of staggering density
and extent. The filaments carried signals: Petrov had detected faint
electromagnetic pulses propagating through the network at velocities
that implied something very close to the speed of light in silicon.

"It's a network," Sokolova said.

"It's a computer," Petrov corrected. "The entire forest is a single
computer. Every column is a processor node. The root network is the
bus architecture. And it's running."

"Running what?"

Petrov shook his head. "I have no idea. But whatever it is, it's been
running for a very long time."

                              IV.

The dating was the next revelation.

Sokolova had been refining her isotopic analysis throughout the mission,
but it was not until the fifth week that she achieved the precision
necessary to make a definitive statement. The oldest columns —
identified by their position at the center of the forest, their
greater diameter, and the higher degree of structural complexity in
their doped lattices — were approximately 3.1 billion years old.

Three point one billion years. Older than multicellular life on Earth.
Older than the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere. Older, by a
considerable margin, than any known fossil.

The crystals had been growing — and computing — for more than three
billion years.

Sokolova presented the data at the evening briefing, and the room went
very quiet.

"Three billion years," Vasquez repeated.

"Plus or minus two hundred million. The margin of error is large at
these timescales, but the order of magnitude is solid."

"And they've been computing the entire time?"

"The energy signature is continuous. The metabolic heat hasn't varied
significantly — Petrov's analysis of the thermal history, derived from
the isotopic gradients in the regolith, suggests that the columns have
maintained their internal temperature within a narrow range for the
entire duration of their existence. Whatever they're computing, they
haven't stopped."

Vasquez leaned back in his chair. He was not a man given to
philosophical speculation, but Sokolova could see the question forming
behind his eyes — the same question that had been forming behind hers
for days.

"A single calculation," he said. "Running for three billion years."

"That's one interpretation."

"What's another?"

Sokolova considered. "It could be a continuous process — something
iterative, like a simulation. Running, refining, running again. Three
billion years of successive approximation."

"A simulation of what?"

"I don't know. But the computational capacity is — " She paused, ran the
numbers in her head for the hundredth time. "Each column contains
approximately ten to the twenty-eighth transistor-equivalents. There are
an estimated fourteen million columns in this forest alone, and there
are forty-three forests of comparable size on this moon. The total
computational capacity exceeds anything I can meaningfully compare it
to. It's not just larger than every computer humanity has ever built. It's
larger than every computer humanity could theoretically build using
every atom on Earth as raw material."

The silence in the briefing room had a physical weight.

                              V.

In her sixth week on Kepler-442b, Sokolova stopped sleeping.

Not entirely — she managed three or four hours a night, fitful and
dream-haunted — but the rest of the time she spent in the crystal
forest, taking measurements, running analyses, and thinking. The
crystals hummed around her in the lavender twilight, warm against the
cold air, their amber columns catching the light of the gas giant
overhead, and she thought about time.

Three billion years. The human mind was not equipped to comprehend such
a duration. She could write the number: 3,000,000,000. She could
convert it to seconds: approximately 9.5 times ten to the sixteenth.
She could enumerate the things that had happened on Earth during the
same interval: the emergence of photosynthesis, the great oxygenation
event, the evolution of eukaryotes, the Cambrian explosion, the age of
dinosaurs, the rise of mammals, the emergence of primates, the
development of language, agriculture, cities, writing, mathematics,
science, spaceflight. All of human history — all of terrestrial
biological history — was a footnote to the computation that was running
in these crystals.

And the computation continued. That was the thing she could not stop
thinking about. It had not finished. Whatever answer the crystal
computer sought, it had not yet found it. Three billion years of
continuous calculation, and the answer was still pending.

What question could require three billion years to answer?

She stood in the forest at midnight — local midnight, when the gas giant
eclipsed the star and the sky went dark except for the aurora that
danced in the moon's thin atmosphere, green and violet, energized by the
giant's magnetosphere — and she placed her hand against the nearest
column and felt its warmth and its vibration and she asked the question
aloud, knowing that no one would hear, knowing that the crystals could
not answer, knowing that even if they could answer she might not
recognize the response.

"What are you calculating?"

The crystal hummed beneath her hand. The vibration was steady,
invariant, patient. It had been vibrating at this frequency for three
billion years. It would continue vibrating after Sokolova and her team
departed, after the survey report was filed and archived, after the
human species had run its course and returned its borrowed atoms to the
cosmos. The computation would continue because the computation was the
purpose, and the purpose was the computation, and neither required
human comprehension to proceed.

                              VI.

On the last day, Sokolova made a discovery that she did not include in
the official report.

She had been conducting a final series of measurements on the
electromagnetic signals propagating through the root network — a
routine characterization, intended to provide baseline data for future
missions — when she noticed an anomaly in the signal pattern. The
pulses that traveled through the network were not uniform. They
varied in amplitude, frequency, and timing in ways that she had
initially attributed to noise. But when she applied a Fourier
transform to the signal data and examined the frequency spectrum, she
found structure.

Not random noise. Not the steady hum of a computation proceeding
through its steps. Something else. A pattern within the pattern. A
signal encoded in the gaps between the computational pulses, like a
watermark hidden in the texture of a page.

She spent four hours analyzing it. She mapped the frequency components.
She looked for repetition, for symmetry, for the mathematical
signatures that would indicate a deliberately encoded message.

What she found was simpler than a message. It was a number.

A single number, embedded in the carrier wave of the root network's
signal architecture, repeated at intervals of precisely 3.2 seconds —
the same interval as the repeating unit in the crystal lattice, the
fundamental rhythm of the computation. The number was expressed in
binary, encoded as a sequence of amplitude modulations, and it was very,
very large.

Sokolova converted it to decimal notation. It filled eleven pages of
her notebook. She examined it for recognizable sequences — primes,
Fibonacci numbers, physical constants — and found none. The number was
not a message in any language she could read. It was simply a number.
The current state of a three-billion-year calculation, expressed as a
single, incomprehensible integer.

She stared at it for a long time.

Then she closed her notebook, placed it in her kit, walked back to the
habitat module, and told Vasquez that she had completed her survey. She
did not mention the number. She did not mention it in her report, or in
the papers she subsequently published, or in the lectures she gave at
conferences for the rest of her career.

She kept it to herself, the way you keep a secret that is not yours to
tell — because the number belonged to the crystals, and the crystals
had been working on it for three billion years, and it seemed
presumptuous, somehow, to publish someone else's unfinished work.

                              * * *

On the transport back to Earth, Sokolova sat in the observation lounge
and watched the stars. Kepler-442 was already invisible among them — a
dim K-type star, unremarkable, anonymous, one of four hundred billion
in the galaxy. Somewhere behind its light, on a small moon orbiting a
gas giant, fourteen million columns of silicon stood in the lavender
twilight and continued their calculation.

She wondered, as she often would in the years that followed, whether
the calculation would ever finish. Whether there existed a moment,
perhaps billions of years in the future, when the crystals would
arrive at their answer and fall silent, their heat dissipating into the
cold atmosphere, their vibrations stilling, their three-billion-year
labor complete. She wondered what the answer would look like. Whether
it would be beautiful. Whether anyone would be there to read it.

She thought about the number in her notebook — that vast, unfinished
integer — and she felt something that she could only describe as
reverence. Not for a god, or a creator, or an intelligence that had
designed the crystals for a purpose. She had found no evidence of a
designer. The crystals appeared to be a natural phenomenon: silicon-
based life that had evolved, through processes she did not yet
understand, into a computational substrate of staggering scale. There
was no designer. There was only the computation.

And the computation was enough.

It was enough that somewhere in the universe, on a moon no one had
named, a planetary computer was running a calculation that had begun
before the first cell divided on Earth, and that it would still be
running when the last star in the galaxy burned out. It was enough that
the universe contained things that could not be understood in a single
lifetime, or a single civilization, or a single epoch of biological
evolution. It was enough that the question existed, even if the answer
was forever out of reach.

Sokolova opened her notebook and looked at the number one more time.
Eleven pages of digits, dense and indecipherable, the partial output
of a three-billion-year calculation. She ran her finger along the first
line, the way she might trace a sentence in a language she was still
learning to read.

Then she closed the notebook, and put it away, and watched the stars.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        THE TAXMAN COMETH

                       by Douglas Pemberton

================================================================================

                              I.

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a colony in possession of a
good income must be in want of a tax collector.

Humphrey Bask was that collector, and he approached his work with the
quiet satisfaction of a man who has found his calling. Other men dreamed
of exploring distant worlds, of planting flags on virgin soil, of
gazing upon alien vistas never before seen by human eyes. Humphrey Bask
dreamed of balanced ledgers. He dreamed of receipts filed in triplicate,
of deductions properly documented, of revenue streams flowing in their
appointed channels with the serene inevitability of water finding its
level.

He was, in short, an accountant, and he was magnificent at it.

The Interstellar Revenue Service — a bureaucratic organism of such
Byzantine complexity that it made the tax codes of ancient empires look
like pamphlets — had dispatched Bask to the colony of New Helvetica on
the fourth moon of Tau Ceti V, which had recently committed what the
Service regarded as the most heinous crime in its considerable catalog
of offenses: it had stopped paying its taxes.

Not merely stopped, in fact. The colonists of New Helvetica had drafted
a formal Declaration of Fiscal Independence, a document of remarkable
literary ambition that began with the words, "When in the course of
commercial events, it becomes necessary for a people to dissolve the
pecuniary bonds which have connected them with another," and continued
in that vein for eleven pages of increasingly florid prose, culminating
in a list of grievances against the IRS that was, Bask was obliged to
admit, not entirely without foundation.

They had, for instance, a point about Form 7729-B.

Form 7729-B (Declaration of Extraplanetary Revenue Sources, Subsection
Gamma: Mineral Rights, Biological Patents, and Atmospheric Harvesting
Fees) was a document of such staggering incomprehensibility that even
Bask, who had devoted the better part of two decades to mastering the
tax code in its entirety, occasionally found himself adrift in its
subordinate clauses like a man lost in a particularly hostile jungle.
The colonists' complaint that the form "appears to have been composed by
a committee of deranged lawyers operating under the influence of strong
hallucinogens" was, strictly speaking, inaccurate — the committee had
been perfectly sober — but Bask understood the sentiment.

Nevertheless, the law was the law, and the law said that New Helvetica
owed the Interstellar Revenue Service approximately fourteen million
credits in back taxes, penalties, and accumulated interest, and it was
Bask's job to collect them.

He packed his briefcase.

                              II.

The briefcase was a marvel of bureaucratic engineering. It was composed
of a carbon-fiber composite that could withstand reentry temperatures,
contained a complete archive of the Interstellar Tax Code (all
forty-seven volumes, plus supplements through Amendment 3,417), and
was fitted with a lock that responded only to Bask's thumbprint and a
correctly recited passage from Section 12, Paragraph 8 of the Revenue
Act of 2147 — a passage that Bask could, and frequently did, recite in
his sleep.

Bask himself was a man of moderate height, thinning hair, and an
expression of such studied mildness that strangers frequently mistook
him for a person of no consequence whatsoever. This was, as several
tax evaders had discovered to their cost, a serious error. Behind the
mild expression and the rimless spectacles lay a mind of formidable
precision, a memory that retained tax code the way a sponge retains
water, and a determination that had been described by one former
adversary — the governor of a mining colony who had attempted to claim
an entire asteroid belt as a charitable donation — as "absolutely
terrifying."

He arrived on New Helvetica aboard the IRS courier vessel Revenue's
Due — a small, efficient ship that the Service maintained for exactly
these situations — and was met at the landing field by a delegation
that could only be described as unwelcoming.

The delegation consisted of Governor Elspeth Brunnhilde Kruger — a
woman of considerable stature, both physical and political, who had
been elected on a platform of fiscal rebellion and who regarded Bask
with the expression a homeowner might direct at a particularly
persistent door-to-door salesman — and approximately forty colonists
carrying signs that read TAXATION IS THEFT, NO TAXATION WITHOUT
REPRESENTATION (WE DON'T WANT REPRESENTATION EITHER), and, somewhat
enigmatically, DOWN WITH FORM 7729-B.

Bask descended the gangway with his briefcase in one hand and a copy
of the New Helvetica Revenue Assessment in the other. He adjusted his
spectacles, surveyed the assembled mob with the air of a man inspecting
a garden that had been allowed to go somewhat to seed, and said:

"Good morning. I am Humphrey Bask, Senior Revenue Agent, Interstellar
Revenue Service, Colonial Division, Tau Ceti Sector. I am here to
discuss your outstanding tax obligations. To whom should I address
myself?"

Governor Kruger stepped forward. She was a tall woman with steel-gray
hair pulled back in a bun of such severity that it appeared to be
exerting a mild gravitational field on the surrounding landscape. She
wore the practical coveralls of a frontier colonist and the expression
of a woman who had been looking forward to this confrontation for some
time.

"You can address yourself to the nearest airlock," she said. "We don't
pay taxes here. We seceded."

"Ah," said Bask, with the gentle, patient smile of a man who has heard
this before and who knows, with the serene certainty of mathematical
proof, that secession does not work like that. "I see. Well, perhaps
we might discuss it over a cup of tea?"

                              III.

They did not, in fact, have tea. New Helvetica's primary agricultural
output was a hardy grain that made excellent bread and execrable
beverages, and the colony's one attempt at tea cultivation had produced
a plant whose leaves, when steeped, tasted — as Bask discovered to his
considerable dismay — precisely like a wet dog smells.

They had the meeting anyway, in the colony's town hall — a prefabricated
structure of aluminum and determination that served as council chamber,
courtroom, dance hall, and, on one memorable occasion, emergency
livestock shelter. Governor Kruger sat at the head of the table.
Bask sat at the foot. Between them, arranged along both sides like
spectators at a particularly bureaucratic tennis match, sat the
Colonial Council of New Helvetica, a body of twelve individuals whose
expressions ranged from hostile to very hostile.

Bask opened his briefcase. The sound it made — the precise, oiled click
of a lock engineered to last centuries — had, he knew from experience,
a certain psychological effect. Several council members shifted in
their seats.

"Now then," he said, removing a sheaf of documents with the practiced
delicacy of a surgeon selecting instruments. "Let us begin with the
basics. New Helvetica was established in 2298 under Colonial Charter
7794-Alpha, which grants the colony self-governance in all local
matters while retaining fiscal obligations to the Interstellar
Commonwealth under the Revenue Act of 2147, as amended. Your
Declaration of Fiscal Independence, while admirably written — I
particularly enjoyed the passage comparing the IRS to 'a parasitic
organism of insatiable appetite and no discernible utility' — does not,
I'm afraid, constitute a legal basis for the cessation of tax
payments."

Governor Kruger leaned forward. "We held a vote."

"Indeed you did. A most impressive turnout — ninety-four percent, I
believe. However, the Revenue Act does not provide for unilateral
withdrawal from fiscal obligations by plebiscite. Section 47,
Paragraph 12: 'No colonial entity shall abrogate its revenue
responsibilities through any process not enumerated in Sections 48
through 53 of this Act.' Sections 48 through 53 enumerate a process
of petition, review, arbitration, and legislative approval that
typically requires between seven and twelve years to complete."

"Seven to twelve years!"

"It's quite efficient, really. The previous system took thirty."

Governor Kruger's expression suggested that she was entertaining several
responses to this statement, most of them involving Bask's forcible
removal from the building. She settled for: "Mr. Bask. We have been
paying taxes to the Commonwealth for twenty-three years. In return,
we have received no roads, no hospitals, no schools, no military
protection, and no mail delivery. Our last communication from the
Commonwealth was a form letter informing us that our request for
agricultural subsidies had been filed under the wrong heading and would
need to be resubmitted using Form 2291-C, which, by the way, does not
exist."

Bask paused. He removed his spectacles, polished them with a cloth he
kept in his breast pocket for this purpose, and replaced them on his
nose.

"Form 2291-C does exist," he said. "It was introduced in the 3,416th
Amendment to the Revenue Act, ratified in October of last year. I have
a copy, if you would like one."

"I would not like one."

"It's really quite straightforward. Only eleven pages."

                              IV.

The standoff lasted four days.

Bask spent them in the colony's guest quarters — a converted storage
room that smelled faintly of fertilizer and contained a cot, a desk,
and a lamp that flickered in a rhythm that suggested the colony's power
grid was held together by optimism and prayer. He was, by temperament
and training, a patient man. Patience was the tax collector's greatest
weapon. Empires rose and fell, currencies inflated and deflated,
revolutionary movements burned bright and guttered out, but the tax
code endured, and the tax collector endured with it, outlasting
resistance through the simple, inexorable application of procedure.

Each morning, he presented himself at the town hall with his briefcase
and a new argument. Each morning, Governor Kruger refused to see him.
Each morning, Bask left a neatly typed memorandum on her desk
summarizing the legal, financial, and procedural consequences of
continued non-compliance, and each evening he returned to his quarters
to find the memorandum pinned to his door with a note reading "NO."

On the second day, he discovered that the colony had posted a guard
outside the town hall. The guard was a young man of approximately
nineteen, armed with what appeared to be a repurposed agricultural
tool, who regarded Bask with the defiant expression of a person who has
been assigned a duty he considers both important and slightly absurd.

"Good morning," said Bask.

"You can't come in," said the guard.

"I see. Might I leave this memorandum with you?"

The guard looked at the memorandum — Form 1140-R, Notice of Continued
Non-Compliance, Pre-Enforcement Stage — with the wary expression of a
man being offered a live grenade.

"What is it?"

"A form."

"I don't want a form."

"Very few people do," Bask conceded. "Nevertheless, the regulations
require that it be delivered. You may consider it delivered. Good day."

On the third day, things escalated.

Bask arrived at the town hall to find that the guard had been
reinforced by six additional colonists, all of them carrying signs and
one of them carrying a megaphone through which he was broadcasting, at
considerable volume, a selection of anti-tax slogans that Bask noted
were admirably alliterative.

He approached the megaphone operator — a stout, red-faced man whose
sign read BASK GO HOME — and extended his hand.

"Humphrey Bask, IRS. I couldn't help overhearing your remarks. Quite
creative. However, I should point out that your claim that the
Interstellar Revenue Service 'produces nothing and destroys everything'
is, strictly speaking, inaccurate. The Service produces a quarterly
newsletter."

The megaphone operator stared at him.

"It's quite informative," Bask added. "Would you like a subscription?"

                              V.

On the fourth day, Bask changed tactics.

He did not go to the town hall. He did not deliver a memorandum. He did
not engage with the guard, or the megaphone operator, or any of the
increasingly agitated colonists who had been spending their mornings
protesting outside the guest quarters and their afternoons wondering
why the tax man had not yet given up and gone home.

Instead, he went for a walk.

New Helvetica was, he had to admit, a rather impressive colony. The
grain fields stretched to the horizon in orderly rows, golden under
the yellow-white light of Tau Ceti. The habitation modules were well-
maintained, the infrastructure functional, the livestock healthy. The
colonists had built something real here — something that worked — and
they had done it with minimal support from the Commonwealth they were
now rejecting.

He walked through the fields and spoke to farmers. He visited the
grain processing facility and spoke to the operators. He toured the
school — the one the colonists had built themselves, without
Commonwealth assistance — and spoke to the teacher, a young woman named
Anna who regarded him with suspicion until he complimented the
students' arithmetic and then regarded him with slightly less suspicion.

He asked questions. Not about taxes. About the colony. About the
harvest. About the grain blight that had nearly destroyed the crop
three years ago. About the water recycling system that broke down
every winter. About the med-bay that needed equipment they couldn't
afford. About the freight costs that were eating their margins, and the
trade regulations that were strangling their exports, and the
communications relay that hadn't worked properly in six months.

He listened. He took notes. He asked more questions.

And on the evening of the fourth day, he knocked on Governor Kruger's
door.

She opened it with the expression of a woman who had been expecting a
siege engine and found instead a man with a briefcase and a mild
expression.

"Governor Kruger," Bask said. "I believe I owe you an apology."

Whatever she had been expecting, it was not this. "An apology?"

"You are correct that New Helvetica has received inadequate services
in return for its tax contributions. Having reviewed your colony's
records — which are, if I may say so, admirably maintained — I find
that your grievances are, in most material respects, legitimate. The
Commonwealth has failed in its obligations to this colony."

Kruger stared at him. "Are you... agreeing with us?"

"In part. The Revenue Act of 2147, Section 9, Paragraph 3, establishes
a principle of reciprocal obligation: the Commonwealth provides services
in exchange for revenue, and the failure to provide said services
constitutes grounds for a formal abatement proceeding under Section
51. Additionally, I note that your colony qualifies for seven — no,
eight — categories of deduction and credit that have not been claimed,
totaling approximately eleven point four million credits."

"Eleven point four million?"

"Against a total obligation of fourteen million. Which would reduce your
outstanding balance to approximately two point six million, payable
over a period of ten years at a rate that I believe your colony can
sustain without hardship." He paused. "Furthermore, I intend to file,
on your behalf, a formal complaint regarding the non-delivery of
services, which should result in an additional credit of approximately
one point eight million, reducing your effective obligation to eight
hundred thousand credits."

Governor Kruger opened her mouth, closed it, opened it again.

"I also took the liberty of filling out Form 2291-C on your behalf,"
Bask said, producing the document from his briefcase with the
flourish of a conjurer producing a rabbit. "Your agricultural subsidy
application. I believe it will be approved within ninety days. The
subsidy should more than cover your remaining obligation."

There was a silence of approximately fifteen seconds, during which
Governor Kruger underwent a visible internal revolution.

"Mr. Bask," she said at last. "Would you like to come in for a cup
of — well, it's not tea, exactly, but it's hot and it's wet."

"I would be delighted," said Bask, and meant it.

                              VI.

He departed New Helvetica three days later, having accomplished the
following: collected a signed agreement for the payment of eight hundred
thousand credits in back taxes, payable over ten years; filed seventeen
forms on the colony's behalf, including applications for agricultural
subsidies, infrastructure grants, and a communications relay repair
that the Commonwealth was legally obligated to provide; negotiated a
reduction in freight tariffs under a provision of the Commerce Code
that the colonists had not known existed; and fixed the school's
ventilation system, which had been making an alarming noise that turned
out to be a loose mounting bolt.

Governor Kruger saw him off at the landing field. The crowd that had
greeted his arrival with signs and hostility now watched his departure
with an expression that might, in certain lights, have been mistaken
for something approaching goodwill.

"Mr. Bask," Kruger said, extending her hand. "I confess that when you
arrived, I had planned to have you deported."

"I know," Bask said, shaking her hand. "Your deportation order was
incorrectly filed, by the way. You used Form 4419-A, which applies
to commercial disputes. The correct form for deportation of a
government official is 4419-D. I took the liberty of correcting it."

Kruger looked at him for a long moment. "You corrected your own
deportation order?"

"Proper procedure is important, Governor. Regardless of the
circumstances."

He boarded the Revenue's Due, stowed his briefcase in its accustomed
place beside the navigation console, and settled into the pilot's
seat. As the ship lifted off and the golden fields of New Helvetica
fell away beneath him, he permitted himself a small smile — the smile
of a man who has balanced a particularly challenging ledger and found
that the numbers, against all expectation, add up.

Revenue Agent Humphrey Bask was not, by any conventional measure, a
hero. He did not carry a ray gun, or pilot a fighter, or explore
strange new worlds in search of adventure. He carried a briefcase. He
knew the tax code. And in a galaxy that was, when you got right down
to it, built on commerce and sustained by infrastructure and held
together by the unglamorous, essential, deeply tedious business of
collecting revenue and providing services, that was enough.

It was, in its own quiet way, more than enough.

                            [THE END]

The body was on the dayside, about two hundred meters past the
terminator wall.

Detective Ling Zhao stood at the base of the wall and looked out
through the reinforced viewport at the sunlit plain beyond. The light
was blinding — Gliese 667's red dwarf star hung permanently at the
horizon, never rising, never setting, flooding the dayside with an
unrelenting glare that bleached the basalt to the color of bone. The
surface temperature out there was a hundred and twelve degrees Celsius.
Nothing lived on the dayside. Nothing human could survive more than a
few minutes in a standard pressure suit before the thermal load
overwhelmed the cooling system.

The body was wearing a standard pressure suit. The cooling system had
failed — or had been disabled — approximately six hours before
discovery, according to the medical examiner's preliminary estimate.
Cause of death: hyperthermia. The victim had cooked inside his own
suit.

Zhao turned away from the viewport and looked at the file in her hand.

Name: Marcus Hale. Age: forty-seven. Occupation: chief water engineer
for the city of Meridian. Married, two children. No criminal record.
No known enemies, at least none that warranted the attention of the
Colonial Police.

Last seen: twenty-two hours ago, in the Nightside Quarter.

That was the puzzle. That was the thing that didn't fit. Marcus Hale
had been seen alive on the dark side of the city, in the frozen black
of the Nightside Quarter, more than four kilometers from where his body
had been found on the scorching dayside. Four kilometers, through the
most heavily populated and surveilled city on the planet, past the
terminator wall and its security checkpoints, and out onto a plain
where no one went because there was no reason to go there and every
reason not to.

Someone had moved him. Someone had carried or coerced or dragged Marcus
Hale from one side of the world to the other and left him to die in
the light.

                              II.

Meridian was the only city on Gliese 667Cc, and it existed because of
a freak of orbital mechanics.

The planet was tidally locked — one face permanently turned toward its
star, the other permanently turned away. The dayside was a furnace. The
nightside was a glacier. But along the terminator — the line where
eternal day met eternal night — conditions were, by a narrow margin,
habitable. The temperature gradient created persistent winds that
circulated heat from the dayside and cold from the nightside, producing
a strip of atmosphere along the terminator where the temperature held
at a tolerable range and liquid water pooled in basins carved by
thermal erosion.

Meridian straddled this line. The city was long and narrow, running
north-south along the terminator for forty kilometers, never more than
three kilometers wide. To the east — the dayside — the terminator wall
rose thirty meters, a barrier of reinforced concrete and thermal
shielding that protected the city from the unrelenting solar radiation.
To the west — the nightside — the insulation wall, somewhat lower,
held back the deepest cold.

Between the walls, the city lived.

It was a strange place, Meridian. The light never changed — a permanent
twilight, the sun forever at the horizon, casting long shadows that
never moved. The eastern districts, closest to the dayside wall, were
warmer, brighter, more affluent — the homes of the engineers and
administrators who ran the colony's water and power systems. The
western districts, closest to the nightside, were cooler, dimmer,
rougher — the quarters of the miners and laborers who worked the ice
fields on the nightside, harvesting water that the city's recycling
systems could never quite produce in sufficient quantities.

The social geography was as stark as the physical geography. Day and
night. Light and dark. Warm and cold. The rich lived in the light; the
poor lived in the shadow; and the terminator wall divided them as surely
as any wall had ever divided any city in the long, sorry history of
human habitation.

Zhao knew this geography intimately. She had grown up in the Nightside
Quarter.

                              III.

She started in the place where Hale had last been seen: a bar called
the Long Shadow, on the western edge of the Nightside Quarter, where
the insulation wall cast a permanent darkness over a street of
drinking establishments, gambling houses, and businesses of a less
easily categorized nature.

The Long Shadow was a low-ceilinged room with recycled air that smelled
of copper and sweat and the sharp, chemical tang of nightside moonshine.
The bartender was a thin man named Czerny who had the careful eyes of
someone who made his living noticing things and the careful mouth of
someone who made his living not talking about them.

"Marcus Hale," Zhao said, showing the photograph.

Czerny looked at it. "Yeah. He was here."

"When?"

"Night before last." He caught himself on the word and smiled the thin
smile of someone making a joke he'd made ten thousand times. "There's
no night here, is there? Twenty-two hundred hours, give or take."

"Was he alone?"

"He came in alone. He didn't leave alone."

Zhao waited. Czerny polished a glass with a rag that was not making it
cleaner.

"He met someone. A woman. She was waiting for him when he arrived — had
a table in the back, kept her hood up. They talked for about an hour.
Then they left together."

"You get a look at her?"

"Not much of one. Slim. Dark hair, what I could see of it. She was
wearing nightside gear — thermal layers, insulated boots. She looked
like she belonged over here."

"And Hale?"

"He looked like he didn't. Nice clothes, clean hands. Dayside money
slumming in the dark." Czerny set the glass down. "He looked nervous."

                              IV.

Zhao pulled the surveillance footage from the bar's exterior camera and
from the six municipal cameras that covered the route between the Long
Shadow and the terminator wall. The footage showed Hale and the woman
leaving the bar at twenty-three seventeen hours, walking east along
Corridor Nine — one of the main thoroughfares connecting the Nightside
Quarter to the central districts. They walked close together but did
not touch. The woman's hood was up, her face angled away from the
cameras with the practiced awareness of someone who knew where the
cameras were.

At the intersection of Corridor Nine and the Central Axis, they
separated. The woman turned south. Hale continued east, toward the
dayside. The last camera to capture him showed him entering the
maintenance access corridor at the base of the terminator wall at
twenty-three forty-one hours.

After that, nothing. The maintenance corridors had no surveillance.
They were utility passages — narrow, poorly lit, used by engineers to
access the wall's thermal systems. They were also, Zhao knew, one of
the few ways to get from the city to the dayside without passing
through a security checkpoint.

If you knew the access codes. And Marcus Hale, as the city's chief
water engineer, knew every code in the wall.

But why would he go to the dayside? And if he went voluntarily, why
was he dead?

Zhao stared at the frozen image of Hale entering the maintenance
corridor. He was alone. The woman was gone. Whatever had happened to
him on the other side of the wall, she had not gone with him — or at
least, not through the same door.

She went to see the body.

                              V.

The medical examiner's facility was in the Central District, in a
building that maintained a temperature of precisely twenty degrees
Celsius through an elaborate system of thermal management that
struck Zhao, every time she visited, as faintly ironic given its
purpose.

Dr. Emil Vasik was a compact, methodical man who had been examining the
dead of Meridian for twenty years and who regarded each new case with
the detached professional interest of a mechanic examining an engine
that had stopped running.

"Cause of death is straightforward," Vasik said, pulling back the sheet.
"Hyperthermia. Core temperature at the time of discovery was fifty-eight
degrees Celsius. The suit's cooling system was non-functional."

"Disabled?"

"Sabotaged. The coolant line was cut — a clean cut, made with a sharp
tool. Not a failure. Not wear. Someone cut it deliberately."

Zhao looked at the body. Marcus Hale had been a large man, broad-
shouldered, with the thick hands of someone who had spent decades
working with pipes and pumps and the infrastructure that kept a city
alive. His face, in death, was contorted in an expression that Zhao
had seen before — the final grimace of someone who had died slowly and
in great pain.

"How long?"

"From the time the coolant was cut to the time of death? Approximately
ninety minutes. The suit's insulation would have retained some cooling
capacity for the first thirty minutes or so. After that, the
temperature would have risen rapidly."

Ninety minutes. Ninety minutes of feeling the heat build, of knowing
what was happening, of understanding — because Hale was an engineer, and
he would have understood — exactly how long he had left. Zhao felt a
cold anger settle in her chest, the way it always did when a killing
was cruel, when whoever had done it had wanted the victim to suffer.

"Anything else?"

Vasik nodded. "Two things. First, there's bruising on both wrists,
consistent with restraints. Someone bound his hands — probably before
they cut the coolant line. Second — " He turned Hale's right hand
over. On the palm, scratched into the skin with what appeared to be
the broken end of a suit stylus, were four characters:

W A T R

"He wrote that himself," Vasik said. "Sometime during the ninety
minutes. While he was dying."

Zhao stared at the letters. WATR. Water. The dying message of a water
engineer, scratched into his own flesh as the heat consumed him.

What was he trying to say?

                              VI.

The answer came from the most mundane of sources: an accounting ledger.

Zhao had pulled Hale's work records, his personal files, his
communications logs. She had interviewed his wife — a drawn, quiet
woman who said Marcus had been troubled lately but would not say why.
She had interviewed his colleagues at the Water Authority — the
engineers and technicians who maintained the systems that pulled water
from the nightside ice fields and distributed it to the city's
population.

It was one of those colleagues — a junior engineer named Park — who
gave her the thread.

"He was worried about the numbers," Park said. They were sitting in the
Water Authority's break room, a windowless box that smelled of coffee
substitute and recycled air. "The flow rates. He kept checking them,
pulling the logs, running the calculations. He said the numbers didn't
add up."

"What do you mean?"

"The water coming in from the nightside didn't match the water going
out to the city. There was a discrepancy. Not huge — maybe four or five
percent — but it was consistent. Every month, the same gap. Water
was going somewhere, and Marcus couldn't figure out where."

Four or five percent of a city's water supply. In a place like
Meridian, where every liter was harvested from nightside ice at
considerable cost and effort, four or five percent was not a rounding
error. It was a fortune.

Zhao pulled the Water Authority's financial records. She cross-
referenced the flow rate discrepancies with the city's commercial
water contracts. She followed the numbers the way she always followed
numbers — patiently, methodically, the way water follows gravity.

The trail led to the Dayside Development Corporation.

DDC was a consortium of investors from the eastern districts — the
wealthy, sunlit side of the city — who had been buying up mineral
rights on the dayside for the past five years. Mineral extraction on
the dayside was technically legal but practically impossible: the
temperatures were too high, the conditions too hostile, the costs too
extreme. No one could profitably mine the dayside.

Unless they had water. Cheap, unmetered, stolen water, diverted from
the city supply and piped through the terminator wall to a network of
cooling stations that DDC had been quietly constructing in the
maintenance corridors — the same corridors where the surveillance
cameras didn't reach.

Marcus Hale had found the diversion. He had discovered the illegal
pipe junctions hidden in the wall's maintenance spaces, tapped into
the city's water main, siphoning four or five percent of the supply
to cool the dayside mining equipment. He had gone to the Long Shadow
to meet an informant — the woman with the hood, who Zhao would later
identify as Sera Voss, a former DDC employee turned whistleblower.
Voss had given him the financial records that proved the connection
between the water diversion and DDC's dayside operations.

And then Hale had made a mistake. He had gone into the maintenance
corridors to see the diversion for himself. To document it. To gather
the evidence he needed to bring to the authorities.

Someone had been waiting for him.

                              VII.

They cut his coolant line and left him on the dayside. They left him
in the light, in the killing heat, on the side of the world where no
one went and no one would find him until it was too late. They left
him to die the way a water engineer would understand best — through the
absence of the thing he had spent his life providing.

WATR. Not "water." Not a dying confession or a name or a cryptic clue
from a detective novel. A label. A direction. Look at the water. Follow
the water. The water is the answer.

Zhao arrested three members of DDC's board of directors the following
morning, in their comfortable homes on the warm side of the terminator
wall, where the light never changed and the shadows never moved and
the temperature was always, always just right. She charged them with
murder, conspiracy, and theft of municipal resources. The trial lasted
four weeks and ended in convictions on all counts.

The illegal water diversion was dismantled. The dayside mining
operation was shut down. The four or five percent of the city's water
supply was returned to its proper channels, flowing from the frozen
dark to the living city on the edge between worlds.

                              * * *

Zhao filed her report on a Tuesday — or what passed for Tuesday in a
city with no sunrise and no sunset, where the clocks kept time because
the sky would not. She sat at her desk in the precinct house and
looked out the window at the unchanging twilight of Meridian, at the
long shadows that never moved, at the terminator wall rising in the
east like the edge of a blade dividing light from darkness.

She thought about Marcus Hale, dying in the light. About the letters
scratched into his palm. About the woman in the bar with her hood up,
passing secrets across a table in the dark. About the water flowing
through hidden pipes in the wall — the wall that divided the city, the
wall that divided the world, the wall that divided everything into
simple, stark, irreconcilable halves: day and night, hot and cold,
rich and poor, living and dead.

Tidal lock. The planet turned one face to its star and one face to the
void, and the city lived in the narrow margin between them, and the
people who lived there had built their world on that margin and had
learned, as all people learn, that the line between light and darkness
is where the living happens.

She closed the file. She put on her coat. She went home, through the
unchanging twilight, to the Nightside Quarter where she had been born
and where she would, she suspected, grow old — in the shadow of the
wall, on the cold side of the world, where the ice miners worked and
the water flowed and the darkness was not empty but full, full of life
and work and the stubborn, ordinary, magnificent business of going on.

                            [THE END]

                  CHILDREN OF THE MAGNETIC FIELD

                       by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                              I.

The first lightning struck at dawn, as it always did.

Dr. Amara Obi watched it from the observation platform of the field
station, her notebook open on her knee, her pen moving in the quick,
practiced shorthand she had developed over six months of daily
observation. The bolt descended from a sky the color of hammered copper
— not the jagged, branching lightning of Earth, but a thick, sinuous
column of plasma that twisted as it fell, corkscrewing through the
dense atmosphere like a living thing seeking the ground. It struck the
basalt plain two kilometers east of the station and held, blazing,
for eleven seconds before it dissipated, leaving a glowing scar on the
rock that would cool to a glassy residue by midday.

She noted the duration, the apparent diameter, the color — a deep,
saturated violet that indicated a high proportion of ionized nitrogen —
and the coordinates of the strike point. Then she turned her binoculars
to the plain and waited.

They came within minutes. Three of them, emerging from the network of
shallow caves that riddled the basalt escarpment to the north. They
moved across the plain with the fluid, undulating gait that Obi had
come to associate with purpose — not the random wandering of their
foraging behavior, but the directed, rapid locomotion that meant they
had sensed something and were going to investigate.

The Voltari. Obi's name for them, derived from the Italian physicist
and pending approval from the Xenobiological Nomenclature Committee,
which would almost certainly replace it with something in Latin that
no one would ever use. They were the dominant macrofauna of Kepler-62f
— bipedal, roughly two meters tall, their bodies sheathed in a
integument of metallic scales that shimmered with iridescent blues and
greens as they moved. Each individual bore a crown of branching
filaments — fine, flexible structures that rose from the skull plate
and spread outward in a pattern that reminded Obi, every time she saw
it, of the dendritic form of a river delta viewed from orbit.

The filaments were antennae. This much she had established in her first
month. They were sensitive to electromagnetic radiation across a
bandwidth that dwarfed human sensory capacity: from the extremely low
frequencies of the planet's geomagnetic field to the high frequencies
of visible light and beyond, into the ultraviolet. The Voltari did not
merely inhabit a world of intense magnetic fields and constant
electrical discharge. They perceived it. They navigated by it, the way
a migrating bird navigates by the Earth's magnetic field, but with a
sensitivity and a sophistication that elevated the comparison from
analogy to insult.

The three Voltari reached the lightning strike site and stopped. They
arranged themselves in a triangle around the glowing scar, their
filaments extended and quivering, and they stood motionless for
approximately four minutes.

They were reading the residual electromagnetic signature of the strike.
Obi was almost certain of this. The lightning had deposited energy into
the basalt — had magnetized it, had altered its electrical properties,
had left a trace in the rock the way a footprint is left in mud. And
the Voltari were reading that trace with the same focused attention
that a tracker brings to a spoor.

Then one of them did something Obi had not seen before.

It raised its upper limbs — long, four-fingered hands with an
opposable digit that suggested tool use, though she had not yet
observed any — and extended them toward the sky. The filaments on its
crown spread to their fullest extent, a fan of metallic threads that
caught the copper light and scattered it into tiny rainbows. And from
the tips of those filaments, a faint luminescence appeared: a pale,
blue-white glow that strengthened over the course of several seconds
until it was clearly visible to the naked eye at two kilometers.

The glow intensified. It brightened. It concentrated.

And then, with a crack that Obi heard clearly at the observation
platform, a bolt of lightning erupted from the Voltari's filaments and
struck the basalt at its feet.

Obi's pen stopped moving. She set her binoculars down very carefully,
as though they might break if she moved too quickly, and she stared
at the plain where the Voltari stood in its triangle of companions,
the afterimage of its lightning bolt still fading from the rock.

It had generated lightning. It had drawn charge from the atmosphere —
or perhaps from the planet's magnetic field itself — concentrated it
in its filaments, and discharged it. Deliberately. Controllably. A
living organism, two meters tall, producing a directed electrical
discharge of a magnitude that Obi estimated, based on the luminosity
and the acoustic report, at somewhere in the range of fifty to a
hundred million volts.

She picked up her pen and wrote, in letters larger than her usual
shorthand: THEY MAKE THEIR OWN LIGHTNING.

                              II.

Kepler-62f was, by any reckoning, a hostile world.

Its magnetic field was approximately eight hundred times stronger than
Earth's — a consequence of its large, rapidly spinning iron core and
its close orbit around a magnetically active K-type star. The field
permeated everything. It bent the paths of charged particles in the
atmosphere, creating perpetual auroral displays that painted the sky in
curtains of green and violet and rose. It induced electrical currents
in the basalt bedrock, making the ground itself a conductor. It
interacted with the stellar wind to produce electromagnetic storms of
staggering intensity, during which the sky filled with lightning and
the air crackled with static discharge and every piece of unshielded
electronic equipment in the field station went haywire.

The field station itself was a Faraday cage — a sealed enclosure of
conductive mesh that diverted the electromagnetic energy around its
contents. Without this shielding, the station's instruments would
have been useless, its power systems overloaded, its communications
equipment reduced to expensive paperweights. The five members of the
survey team lived and worked inside a bubble of electromagnetic calm,
venturing out in shielded suits that protected their own bioelectric
systems from the planet's overwhelming electromagnetic environment.

Life on Kepler-62f had no such protection. Life on Kepler-62f did not
need it. Life on Kepler-62f had evolved in the magnetic field the way
terrestrial life had evolved in gravity: it was not merely adapted to
it but fundamentally shaped by it, in ways that Obi was only beginning
to understand.

The Voltari were the most spectacular example, but they were not the
only one. The planet's ecology was saturated with electromagnetic
adaptations. The plant-analogues — sprawling, low-growing organisms
that covered the basalt plains in mats of metallic filament — were
rooted not in soil but in the planet's magnetic field lines, their
growth patterns following the invisible contours of the field the way
terrestrial vines follow the contours of a trellis. The small,
six-legged grazers that fed on these mats navigated by
magnetoreception, their bodies containing dense concentrations of
magnetite crystals that aligned with the field and provided a
directional sense of exquisite precision. Even the microbial organisms
in the thin, alkaline soils showed electromagnetic adaptations:
magnetotactic bacteria that oriented themselves along field lines,
forming chains and clusters that created their own microscale magnetic
environments.

It was an ecology of electromagnetism. A biosphere organized not by
photosynthesis and chemistry, as on Earth, but by the invisible,
all-pervasive force of the magnetic field. Obi had spent six months
studying it, and she was nowhere near the bottom.

                              III.

The Voltari communicated in lightning.

Obi confirmed this over the course of three weeks of intensive
observation, during which she documented two hundred and seventeen
discrete instances of what she categorized as "directed electrical
discharge in a social context" — which was the formal way of saying
that the Voltari stood in groups and shot lightning at each other.

Not at each other, exactly. Between each other. The discharges were
controlled, precise, and — crucially — modulated. They varied in
intensity, duration, frequency, and waveform, and they varied in
patterns that were too regular and too context-dependent to be random.
When two Voltari met on the plain, they exchanged discharges in
sequences that lasted between ten seconds and four minutes. When a
group of Voltari assembled near the cave entrances at the end of the
day — if day was the right word on a planet where the auroral light
never fully dimmed — they produced coordinated displays of electrical
discharge that rippled through the group in waves, each individual
contributing its own modulated bolt to a collective conversation of
such bandwidth and complexity that Obi's recording equipment could
barely capture a fraction of it.

They were talking. In lightning.

The implications were extraordinary. On Earth, biological communication
had evolved along two primary channels: chemical (pheromones, hormones)
and mechanical (sound waves, vibration). Electromagnetic communication
existed — fireflies, electric eels, certain deep-sea fish — but always
as a secondary or specialized system, never as the primary medium of
complex social communication.

The Voltari had taken a different path. In an environment saturated
with electromagnetic energy, where the very atmosphere crackled with
charge and the ground hummed with induced currents, they had evolved
the ability to not merely sense but to generate and modulate
electromagnetic signals with a precision and a bandwidth that made
human speech seem, by comparison, like communication by smoke signal.

Obi spent long hours at her instruments, recording and analyzing the
Voltari's electromagnetic conversations. The data was dense,
multidimensional, and maddeningly difficult to parse. Each discharge
carried information encoded in multiple simultaneous channels:
amplitude, frequency, waveform, polarization, duration, and
repetition rate, all varying independently and all potentially
meaningful. It was as though someone were speaking in a language
that used not twenty-six letters but twenty-six thousand, and Obi
was trying to learn it armed with a microphone and a prayer.

But patterns emerged. They always did, if you watched long enough and
carefully enough. Obi identified what appeared to be greeting sequences
— short, stereotyped exchanges that preceded longer interactions, the
electromagnetic equivalent of hello. She identified alarm signals —
intense, high-frequency bursts that caused all nearby Voltari to
freeze and orient their filaments toward the source, the equivalent of
a shout. She identified what she tentatively categorized as caregiving
signals — gentle, low-frequency discharges exchanged between adult
Voltari and the smaller juveniles that accompanied them, modulated with
a softness that reminded her, irresistibly, of a mother's voice.

On the twenty-third day of intensive observation, she identified
something that stopped her cold.

                              IV.

The Voltari were teaching.

She had been observing a group of five adults and three juveniles on
the basalt plain south of the field station. The adults were arranged
in a loose circle around a recently cooled lightning scar, and they
were taking turns generating discharges — short, controlled bolts that
struck the basalt at specific points around the scar's circumference.
Each discharge was different: varying in intensity and waveform, each
one leaving a slightly different electromagnetic residue in the rock.

The juveniles watched. Their filaments were extended and trembling with
what Obi interpreted as attention — the young Voltari's entire sensory
apparatus focused on the demonstration. After each adult's discharge,
the adult turned to the nearest juvenile and produced a brief,
low-intensity signal — the caregiving frequency, but modulated with
a rising intonation that Obi had not previously cataloged.

A prompt. An invitation. Your turn.

The juvenile stepped forward. It was small — perhaps a meter and a
half, its scales still showing the mottled pattern of immaturity —
and its filaments were shorter, less branched, less developed than the
adults'. It extended its upper limbs in imitation of the adult's
posture, spread its filaments, and concentrated.

The glow appeared. Faint, flickering, unsteady. The juvenile strained,
its whole body rigid with effort, and a small, stuttering discharge
leaped from its filaments and struck the basalt a meter from the
intended target.

The adult responded with a signal that Obi's instruments recorded as a
complex waveform of moderate intensity and low frequency — a signal
that, in its rhythm and its modulation, bore an unmistakable
resemblance to the caregiving frequency but with additional harmonic
content that suggested encouragement. Or instruction. Or correction.

The juvenile tried again. This time the discharge was stronger, more
controlled, and it struck closer to the target. The adult's response
was the same signal, but brighter, more emphatic.

They were teaching their young to make lightning. They were teaching
them to control the discharge, to aim it, to modulate it. They were
transmitting a skill across generations — a skill that was not instinct,
not hardwired, but learned, practiced, refined through repetition and
guided by instruction.

Culture. Obi wrote the word in her notebook and underlined it three
times.

Not tool use. Not language, exactly, though the communication system
certainly qualified. Something more fundamental. The deliberate
transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next. The capacity
to teach and learn. The foundation upon which all other cultural
achievements are built.

The Voltari had it.

                              V.

The storm came on the forty-seventh day.

Obi had been expecting it. The planet's electromagnetic storms followed
a roughly thirty-day cycle tied to variations in the stellar wind, and
her instruments had been tracking the buildup of charge in the
atmosphere for a week. When the storm arrived, it arrived with a
violence that made the daily lightning look like static electricity.

The sky turned from copper to a deep, pulsing purple. The auroral
curtains intensified until they filled the entire sky with sheets of
green and violet fire. Lightning struck the basalt plain in continuous
volleys — not single bolts but cascades of electrical discharge that
lit the landscape in a flickering, stroboscopic glare. The sound was
not thunder as Obi understood it but a continuous, resonant drone, a
vibration that she felt in her bones and her teeth and the fillings in
her molars.

The Voltari came out.

All of them. Not the small groups of three or five that Obi typically
observed, but the entire population of the escarpment colony — adults,
juveniles, and the tiny, barely mobile infants that she had only
glimpsed in the mouths of caves. Hundreds of them, emerging onto the
plain in a slow, deliberate procession, their filaments fully extended,
their scales blazing with reflected light.

They arranged themselves on the plain in a pattern that Obi recognized
after several minutes of frantic sketching: a spiral. A vast, slowly
rotating spiral of metallic bodies and branching filaments, hundreds
of meters across, oriented with its axis pointing toward the magnetic
pole.

And then they began to sing.

It was the only word Obi could find for it, though it was nothing like
song as she understood it. Each Voltari in the spiral generated a
discharge — not a bolt, but a sustained, modulated emission of
electromagnetic energy that blended with the emissions of its neighbors
into a collective signal of breathtaking complexity. The spiral became
an antenna. Hundreds of bodies, thousands of filaments, all generating
and modulating and combining their individual signals into a single,
coherent, impossibly intricate electromagnetic composition that rose
from the plain and merged with the storm.

Obi's instruments overloaded. Every sensor she had pointed at the
spiral registered maximum input and stopped recording. She switched to
passive observation — her eyes, her ears, her own imperfect human
senses — and she watched.

The storm responded.

The lightning changed. The random, chaotic discharges that had been
striking the plain reorganized themselves, drawn by the Voltari's
collective signal into patterns that matched the spiral's geometry.
Bolts curved in midair, bending toward the spiral, striking the basalt
in sequences that traced the spiral's arms. The aurora overhead shifted,
its curtains aligning with the magnetic flux that the spiral was
generating, forming a column of green light that descended from the
sky and touched the center of the formation like a benediction.

The Voltari were not hiding from the storm. They were not enduring it.
They were participating in it. They were shaping it — reaching into
the planet's magnetic field with their collective electromagnetic
output and modulating it, the way a musician shapes sound, the way a
conductor shapes an orchestra.

They were making the storm into music.

Obi stood on the observation platform, tears streaming down her face,
and she listened with every instrument she had — electronic and
biological — to a symphony played in lightning on a world where the
magnetic field was as fundamental as air, and she understood that she
was witnessing something that no human framework was adequate to
describe.

Not communication. Not tool use. Not culture, though it was all of
these things. It was art. Electromagnetic art, performed in a medium
that no human sense could fully perceive, in a language that no human
mind could fully comprehend, on a scale that dwarfed any artistic
endeavor in the history of her species.

The Voltari sang their storm, and the storm sang back, and the planet
rang like a bell in the magnetic field of its star.

                              VI.

Obi's report to the Xenobiological Survey Committee ran to four hundred
pages. It documented six months of observation, cataloged three hundred
and twelve distinct electromagnetic signal patterns, described the
Voltari's social structure, reproductive behavior, territorial range,
and dietary habits, and included spectographic analyses of their
electrical discharges that would keep electromagnetic biologists busy
for a decade.

But the section that caused the most debate — the section that was
excerpted in journals and discussed at conferences and argued over
in faculty lounges from Caltech to Cambridge — was a single paragraph
near the end, in which Obi addressed the question that every reviewer
would ask: Are the Voltari intelligent?

She wrote:

"The question is poorly framed. Intelligence, as we define it, is a
product of our own evolutionary history — a set of cognitive capacities
shaped by the specific challenges of surviving on a planet where
gravity is the dominant physical force, where chemistry is the primary
medium of biological process, and where communication occurs through
the mechanical vibration of air molecules. The Voltari have evolved
under fundamentally different constraints. Their world is shaped by
electromagnetism as ours is shaped by gravity. Their biology is
organized around the perception, generation, and modulation of
electromagnetic fields as ours is organized around the perception
and manipulation of physical objects. To ask whether they are
intelligent by our standards is to ask whether a fish is a competent
mountaineer.

"What I can say, on the basis of six months of observation, is this:
The Voltari communicate in a language of extraordinary bandwidth and
complexity. They teach their young. They engage in collective behaviors
that require coordination, timing, and what can only be described as
aesthetic sensibility. They respond to their electromagnetic
environment not merely as organisms adapted to a niche, but as agents
capable of shaping that environment in ways that transcend immediate
biological necessity.

"Whether this constitutes intelligence, I leave to the philosophers.
What it constitutes, beyond any doubt, is wonder."

                              * * *

On her last evening on Kepler-62f, Obi left the field station and
walked out onto the basalt plain alone.

The aurora was bright — green and violet curtains rippling overhead in
the stellar wind — and the plain was quiet, the daily lightning paused
in the brief lull between the star's magnetic cycles. She walked until
the field station was a dim glow behind her, and she stopped, and she
stood in the electromagnetic hum of a planet that was, in every sense
she could measure, alive with invisible energy.

A Voltari appeared at the edge of her vision. A large adult, its
filaments spread in the resting configuration that she had learned to
associate with calm attention. It approached to within twenty meters
and stopped.

Obi raised her hand. A human gesture, meaningless in the electromagnetic
spectrum. But the Voltari's filaments oriented toward her, sensing the
faint bioelectric field that her own nervous system generated — the
tiny, pitiful electromagnetic signature of a carbon-based organism
evolved on a world where magnetism was an afterthought.

The Voltari extended its filaments fully. A faint glow appeared at
their tips. And then, with a gentleness that Obi felt rather than
heard — a soft, low-frequency pulse that washed over her like a warm
breeze — the Voltari spoke to her.

She could not understand the words. She could barely detect the signal.
But she felt it: a vibration in the air, a tingle on her skin, a
whisper at the very edge of human perception that carried, in its
modulation, something that required no translation.

Greeting. Farewell. Recognition. The electromagnetic equivalent of one
mind acknowledging another across the vast divide of biology and
evolution and the silent, singing distances of the magnetic field.

Obi stood on the plain and received it, and she answered with the only
electromagnetic signal she could produce: the faint, steady pulse of
her own living heart.

                            [THE END]

                   THE SIEGE OF FORTRESS LUNA

               by Col. James "Buck" Stanton (Ret.)

================================================================================

                              I.

The alert came at 0347 hours, and Lieutenant Sara Oakes was asleep
when it hit.

She rolled off the rack and had her boots on in six seconds — a skill
drilled into her during basic at Tycho Base until it was reflex, not
thought. The klaxon was the short-long-short pattern: security breach,
internal. Not incoming fire. Not depressurization. Someone inside the
fortress had done something they shouldn't have.

She keyed her comm. "Oakes. Report."

The voice that came back was Sergeant Kwan's, clipped and tight.
"Lieutenant, Colonel Ravenel has locked down the command center. He's
sealed blast doors on levels three through seven. We've got people
trapped in the barracks, the mess, and the medical bay."

Oakes was already moving down the corridor, her sidearm in its holster,
her mind running the layout of Fortress Luna the way a chess player
runs a board. Command center: level five, center of the complex,
armored walls, independent life support, direct access to the weapons
grid. If Ravenel had the command center, he had the fortress. And if
he had the fortress—

"What about the defense batteries?"

"He's got them. All six primary installations and the secondary ring.
Targeting computers are active. We're reading power-up on batteries
one through four."

Oakes stopped walking. She stood in the corridor and let the
information settle into her tactical awareness like pieces on a map.

Colonel Henri Ravenel — commander of Fortress Luna, decorated veteran
of the Martian Emergency, holder of the Silver Star and the Combat
Astronautics Badge — had seized control of the most powerful military
installation in cislunar space. The defense batteries could hit any
target within five hundred thousand kilometers. That included every
orbital station, every transit ship, and the entirety of the planet
Earth.

"How many with him?"

"We count between fifteen and twenty. His personal staff, mostly.
Captain Yeager, Lieutenant Diaz, Gunnery Sergeant Pratt. The loyal
ones."

Oakes noted the word. Loyal. Not to the chain of command. Not to the
oath. To Ravenel. She had seen this coming — not the specifics, not
the when, but the possibility. Ravenel had been deteriorating for
months. The obsessive briefings about Earth's political unreliability.
The late-night lectures about the Moon's strategic vulnerability. The
quiet conversations with officers he trusted, feeling them out, testing
their sympathies. She had reported her concerns through channels. The
reports had gone unanswered.

Now here they were.

"How many effectives do we have outside the lockdown?"

"Forty-three. Mix of garrison troops and support personnel. Most of
our weapons are in the armory on level four — sealed. We've got
sidearms and whatever was in the ready lockers."

"Comm to Earth?"

"Cut. Ravenel disabled the main transmitter first thing. We might be
able to jury-rig something from the backup systems in the maintenance
section, but it'll take time."

Time. The one commodity they couldn't afford. Every minute that
Ravenel held the command center was a minute he could use to
consolidate, to negotiate, to issue demands. Or to fire.

"What's he saying?"

"He broadcast a message on the internal channel about twenty minutes
ago. Said the government on Earth has abandoned its obligations to the
lunar garrison. Said the Moon is the key to controlling near-Earth
space and that leaving it in the hands of politicians is criminally
irresponsible. He's declared the fortress independent of Earth command
and stated that any attempt to retake it by force will be met with —
his words — 'decisive application of the defense batteries.'"

Oakes closed her eyes for three seconds. When she opened them, she had
a plan. Not a good plan. Plans were never good when you were outgunned,
outnumbered in the critical positions, and operating without
communication with higher command. But it was a plan, and a bad plan
executed immediately was better than a good plan executed too late.

"Get me everyone who knows the maintenance tunnel system. We're going
in through the back door."

                              II.

Fortress Luna had been built in 2089, drilled into the basalt of the
Aristarchus Plateau on the Moon's nearside. It was designed to
withstand kinetic bombardment, nuclear attack, and a sustained ground
assault by a force several times its garrison's size. It was not
designed to withstand betrayal from its own commander.

But it was designed by engineers, and engineers think about
maintenance. Every system in the fortress — every power conduit, every
air handler, every water recycler, every blast door actuator — required
periodic inspection and repair. And the inspection and repair required
access. The maintenance tunnels were narrow, unlit, unpressurized in
places, and thoroughly uncomfortable, but they connected every level
of the fortress in a warren of secondary passages that paralleled the
main corridors like the service tunnels behind a hotel's public spaces.

Oakes had crawled through them during damage control drills. She had
cursed their designers, their cramped dimensions, their sharp turns,
and their absolute darkness. She had never imagined she would be
grateful for them.

She assembled her team in the maintenance hub on level two — the lowest
level still accessible, below the lockdown zone. Eight people. Sergeant
Kwan, who had twelve years in the garrison and knew the tunnel system
better than anyone. Corporal Vasquez, demolitions-qualified. Private
First Class Chen, the youngest and smallest member of the garrison, who
could fit through access ways that would stop a larger person cold.
Four others: reliable, steady, willing.

They were armed with sidearms and two cutting tools. Against Ravenel's
people, who held the armory and its full complement of military
weapons, it was not an encouraging inventory.

"Here's the situation," Oakes said, spreading a schematic of the
fortress on the deck. "Ravenel holds levels three through seven. The
command center is on five. The defense battery controls are routed
through the command center — he can fire from there. Our objective is
to reach the command center and neutralize his control of the weapons
grid before he uses it."

"Neutralize how?" Kwan asked.

"Ideally, by cutting the hardline connections between the command
center and the battery control systems. There are four primary
conduits." She marked them on the schematic. "Here, here, here, and
here. They run through the maintenance tunnels on level four. If we
cut all four, the command center loses direct control of the batteries.
Ravenel can still issue orders verbally to gun crews in the battery
emplacements, but that requires the gun crews to cooperate — and I'm
betting most of them won't."

"And if they do cooperate?"

"Then we have a bigger problem. But right now, the main threat is the
automated targeting system in the command center. Ravenel can fire all
six primary batteries from a single console. If we take that
capability away from him, we reduce the threat by an order of
magnitude."

Kwan studied the schematic. "The tunnel route to level four is about
six hundred meters. There are four access hatches between here and the
conduit points. If Ravenel's people are monitoring the maintenance
system — and they should be, if they're competent — they'll see us
coming."

"Some of them are competent. Pratt, definitely. Yeager, probably. But
they're focused on the main corridors and the blast doors. The tunnels
are a secondary concern — too narrow for a conventional assault. They
won't expect us to use them for a sabotage run."

"You hope."

"I assess. There's a difference." Oakes folded the schematic. "We go
in forty minutes. Kwan takes two people to conduits one and two. I take
Vasquez and Chen to conduits three and four. We cut on my signal —
simultaneously, so Ravenel doesn't get a chance to reroute. Questions?"

There were questions. She answered them. There were objections. She
overruled them. There was fear — she could see it in their eyes, the
same fear she felt in her own chest, a cold weight that sat behind
her sternum like a stone. She did not mention it. Fear was not
information. Fear was not a plan. Fear was an obstacle, and you dealt
with obstacles by moving through them.

They moved.

                              III.

The maintenance tunnels were exactly as bad as Oakes remembered.

Narrow — barely wide enough for a person in a pressure suit to move
on hands and knees. Dark — the emergency lighting had been cut with
the rest of the power grid, and they moved by helmet lamps that cast
jittering circles of white light on riveted steel walls. Cold — the
thermal regulation system was offline, and the ambient temperature in
the tunnels was the ambient temperature of the lunar subsurface: minus
thirty Celsius, cold enough to fog their faceplates and numb their
fingers inside their gloves.

Oakes led. Behind her, Vasquez and Chen moved in silence, their
breathing loud in the confined space, their equipment clicking softly
against the tunnel walls. The schematic was in her head — she had
memorized it during the briefing, the way she memorized every tactical
layout, because paper could be lost and electronic devices could fail
but memory, properly trained, was reliable.

They reached the first junction in twelve minutes. A vertical shaft,
two meters wide, descending from level two to level four. Oakes went
down first, bracing her feet against the rungs of a maintenance ladder
that had not been designed for rapid descent. The shaft opened onto a
horizontal tunnel that ran north-south along level four, paralleling
the main corridor on the other side of the wall.

She could hear voices through the wall. Ravenel's people, moving in
the corridor. She froze. Vasquez and Chen froze behind her. They
waited, counting heartbeats, until the voices faded.

"Conduit three is two hundred meters north," Oakes whispered. "Conduit
four is one hundred meters south. Vasquez, you take three. Chen, you're
with me on four. We wait for Kwan's ready signal. Cut on my mark."

Vasquez nodded and moved north, silent, compact, professional. Oakes
and Chen moved south.

The tunnel narrowed. At one point they had to remove their equipment
packs and push them ahead, squeezing through a section where the
walls closed to less than a meter. Chen, smaller, moved through
easily. Oakes, broader in the shoulders, scraped both arms raw against
the riveted walls and said nothing about it.

They reached conduit four. It was a bundle of armored cables, each one
as thick as Oakes's wrist, running through a reinforced channel in the
tunnel wall. The cables carried the command signals from the fire
control console in the command center to Battery Emplacement Four on
the surface. They were designed to survive a direct nuclear strike on
the fortress's exterior. They were not designed to survive a
demolitions-qualified corporal with a cutting tool applied from the
inside.

Oakes keyed her comm. "Team two in position at conduit four."

A pause. Then Kwan's voice, barely audible through the rock: "Team
one in position at conduits one and two. Ready."

Another pause. Then Vasquez: "In position at conduit three. Ready."

Oakes looked at the cables. Four conduits. Four cuts. The difference
between a madman with a button and a madman with a radio. Not a
perfect solution. But better.

"All teams. Cut on my mark. Three. Two. One. Mark."

The cutting tool bit into the armored cable with a sound like tearing
metal. The cable resisted — it was supposed to resist, that was its
job — but the cutting tool was designed for exactly this kind of work,
and Chen applied it with a steady, practiced hand. Twelve seconds. The
cable parted. The severed ends sparked and went dark.

"Conduit four, cut."

Kwan's voice: "Conduits one and two, cut."

Vasquez: "Conduit three — " A pause. A sound in the background that
Oakes recognized immediately: a hatch opening. "Contact! I've got
two hostiles in the tunnel, thirty meters north."

Oakes heard the flat crack of a sidearm, muffled by distance and rock.
Then another. Then Vasquez's voice, strained but controlled: "Conduit
three, cut. Two hostiles down. I'm hit — left arm. Functional."

"Fall back to the junction. All teams, fall back."

They moved. Fast, now — no time for stealth, because the shots would
have been heard and Ravenel would be sending people into the tunnels.
The advantage of surprise was gone. What remained was the advantage
of having accomplished the objective.

Four conduits, cut. Ravenel had lost automated control of the defense
batteries.

                              IV.

The next six hours were the worst of Oakes's life.

Ravenel responded to the conduit cuts with fury. He sent teams into
the maintenance tunnels — ten people, armed, dangerous. Oakes and her
team fought a running engagement through the narrow passages, using
their knowledge of the tunnel system to stay ahead, to ambush, to
withdraw. Two of Ravenel's people were wounded in the tunnels and
pulled back. One of Oakes's people — Private Tan — took a round in
the thigh and had to be carried.

Meanwhile, Ravenel attempted to restore automated control of the
batteries. His technicians worked on the severed conduits while his
troops provided security. Oakes sent Chen — the smallest, the
fastest, the quietest — back through the tunnels to observe and
report. Chen confirmed that the repairs were underway and estimated
four hours to completion.

Four hours. Oakes had four hours to end this, or Ravenel would have
his finger on the button again.

She used them. While Kwan held the tunnels with five people, Oakes
took the remaining three and worked her way up to level five through
a maintenance shaft that was not on the official schematic — a
ventilation bypass that Kwan had discovered three years ago and never
reported, on the grounds that reporting it would mean someone would
seal it.

The shaft opened into a utility closet adjacent to the command center's
life support room. Oakes could hear Ravenel on the other side of the
wall, giving orders. His voice was calm, controlled, reasonable. That
was the worst part. He was not raving. He was not deranged. He was a
competent, experienced military commander who had made a calculated
decision that the chain of command was wrong and that he knew better.
He was sane, and he was certain, and that made him more dangerous than
any lunatic.

Oakes looked at her team. Three people. Two sidearms — Chen had given
hers to the walking wounded. Against Ravenel and however many of his
loyalists remained in the command center.

She thought about calling for a negotiation. She thought about waiting
for Earth to respond — surely someone had noticed that Fortress Luna
had gone silent. She thought about all the sensible, by-the-book
options that a by-the-book officer would consider.

Then she thought about the defense batteries. About the automated
targeting system being repaired four levels below. About the cities
on Earth, going about their business under a sky they assumed was
friendly, unaware that a man on the Moon had decided their fate was
his to determine.

She kicked open the door.

                              V.

The fight in the command center lasted ninety seconds.

Oakes came through the door with her weapon up and her voice louder
than the klaxon. "Down! Everyone down! Hands visible!"

Three of Ravenel's people went down immediately — shocked, startled,
unwilling to die for a cause they had only half believed in. Captain
Yeager went for his weapon and took a stun round from Corporal Dinh
that dropped him like a bag of sand. Gunnery Sergeant Pratt — the
dangerous one, the true believer — leveled a rifle at Oakes and held
it steady, his eyes flat and hard.

"Stand down, Sergeant," Oakes said.

"Can't do that, Lieutenant."

"You can. You will. The conduits are cut. The colonel has no control
of the batteries. It's over."

Pratt's eyes flickered. He knew. He had heard the reports from the
repair team. He knew that the conduits were cut and that the repairs
were not yet complete. He knew that the situation had changed.

But he was a loyal man, and loyalty, once given, was not easily
withdrawn.

"Colonel?" he said, without taking his eyes off Oakes.

Ravenel stood behind the fire control console. He was in full uniform
— pressed, correct, his decorations in place, his bearing the ramrod
posture of a man who had spent forty years in service. His hands were
resting on the console. His face was composed.

He looked at Oakes. He looked at Pratt. He looked at the console
beneath his hands — the console that no longer controlled anything,
whose severed connections rendered it nothing more than an expensive
desk.

"Stand down, Sergeant," Ravenel said quietly.

Pratt lowered his weapon. Dinh secured it. Chen moved in from behind
and placed restraints on Ravenel's wrists — gently, professionally,
without ceremony. Ravenel did not resist.

"Lieutenant," Ravenel said, as Oakes holstered her weapon. "For what
it's worth — the threat was real. Earth's politicians will abandon this
garrison the moment it becomes convenient. I was trying to prevent
that."

"I know, sir."

"And you stopped me."

"Yes, sir."

"Good." He said it quietly, and Oakes could not tell whether he meant
it or not. She decided it didn't matter.

                              VI.

Earth Command restored communications four hours later, when the
cruiser Thermopylae arrived in lunar orbit and reestablished contact.
By that time, Oakes had secured the fortress, treated the wounded —
three on her side, two on Ravenel's, none killed — and restored normal
operations.

The debrief lasted three days. The court-martial would last longer.
Ravenel was charged with mutiny, unlawful seizure of military
property, and threatening use of military weapons against civilian
targets. He pleaded guilty on all counts. He was sentenced to twenty
years.

Oakes received a commendation. She filed it in the same drawer where
she kept her service records and her field manuals and the small brass
compass her father had given her when she received her commission —
the compass that pointed nowhere useful on the Moon but that she
carried anyway, because some things you carry not because they work
but because they mean something.

She returned to duty. The fortress needed running. The batteries needed
maintaining. The garrison needed leading, and the chain of command had
placed that responsibility, temporarily, on her shoulders.

She bore it. Not because she wanted to — command was not a thing she
had sought, not a glory she had craved. She bore it because someone
had to, and because the alternative — the alternative where competent
people refuse responsibility and leave it to the Ravenels of the
world — was worse.

The Moon turned its face to the Earth, as it always had. The fortress
stood on the rim of Aristarchus, as it always had. And Lieutenant
Sara Oakes stood watch over both, doing the unglamorous, essential,
quietly heroic work of keeping the peace in a place where peace was
fragile and the darkness of space pressed in from every side.

                     WORLD WITHOUT SHADOWS

                    by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                              I.

They came out of hyperspace three million klicks from the planet and
right away Jennings said he didn't like it.

"Something wrong with the light," he said, squinting at the viewscreen.
He was a navigator, not a poet, but he had twenty years of deep-space
time behind his eyes and when Jennings said something was wrong, you
listened.

Captain Marta Reeves leaned forward in her chair and looked. The planet
filled the lower quarter of the screen — a blue-green marble, smaller
than Earth, wreathed in white cloud. Nothing wrong with it at first
glance. Oceans, land masses, atmosphere, the whole package. A Class
Three habitable, according to the survey probe data that had brought
them here. The kind of planet the Pathfinder scouts dreamed about
finding and almost never did.

But Jennings was right. Something was off about the light.

"Two suns," said Dr. Park, the mission scientist, pulling up the
stellar data on her console. "Binary system. Kepler-47, remember? A
G-type primary and a K-type secondary, orbital period forty-one days.
They're close — about 0.08 AU separation. From the planet's surface,
they'd appear as two distinct discs in the sky, roughly — " She ran
the calculation. "Roughly fifteen degrees apart at maximum separation."

"Two suns," Jennings said. "So two sets of shadows."

"More than that." Park's fingers moved across her console. "Two light
sources at a small angular separation means overlapping illumination.
At most points on the surface, both suns are above the horizon
simultaneously. Objects would cast two shadows — but because the suns
are close together, the shadows would overlap almost completely. And
at the sub-stellar point, where both suns are directly overhead—"

"No shadows at all," Reeves finished.

"Effectively, yes. The illumination would be nearly omnidirectional.
Like being inside a light box. No shadows, no shading, minimal depth
cues from lighting." Park paused. "It would look very strange."

Jennings made a sound in his throat that was his version of saying I
told you so.

Reeves looked at the planet on the screen. Blue-green, cloud-wrapped,
perfectly inviting. Two suns close together in the sky, washing the
surface in flat, even, shadowless light.

"Take us in," she said.

                              II.

They landed on a coastal plain, fifty meters from a beach of white
sand that stretched in both directions to the curve of the horizon.
The ocean was turquoise. The sky was blue, with thin clouds. The air,
when Reeves cracked the hatch and stepped onto the ramp, smelled of
salt and something faintly sweet, like jasmine.

And there were no shadows.

It took a moment to register — the brain expects shadows the way it
expects gravity, as a fundamental feature of visual reality. But the
two suns, separated by just enough arc to wrap light around every
object from slightly different angles, eliminated them. Reeves stood
on the ramp and looked at her feet. No shadow. She held up her hand.
No shadow. The ship behind her, ten meters of dull gray hull, cast
no shadow on the white sand.

Everything was lit from everywhere. The world looked like a photograph
with the contrast turned down to zero — flat, even, strangely unreal.
Distances were hard to judge. The trees along the beach — or what
passed for trees, broad-leaved growths with pale trunks — stood in a
line that seemed both very close and very far away, because without
shadows, the brain had no cues to anchor depth.

"This is going to give me a headache," Jennings said, stepping off the
ramp and almost tripping over the ground he couldn't quite judge.

Park was already out, running her scanner over the vegetation. "Carbon-
based. Chlorophyll analogue — that's the green. Standard terrestrial
biochemistry, more or less. This planet is about as Earth-like as they
come." She looked up at the sky, at the two suns blazing side by side.
"Except for the light."

They spent the first day surveying the landing site and its immediate
surroundings. The coastal plain was lush — dense vegetation, abundant
insects or their equivalents, small animals that scattered at their
approach. The ocean teemed with life visible from shore: schools of
something silver that flashed in the flat, shadowless light, larger
forms moving beneath the surface. A healthy, thriving biosphere.

But no large fauna. And no signs of current habitation.

Reeves noted this. On a planet this hospitable, you expected
megafauna. You expected something to have filled the niche —
grazers, predators, the usual progression. The absence nagged at her
the way a missing tooth nags at the tongue.

"Plenty of small stuff," Park said at the evening briefing. "Arthropod
equivalents, mostly. Nothing bigger than about two kilograms. No
vertebrate analogues that I can find. The ecosystem seems to be—"
She searched for the word. "Truncated. Like something removed the top
of the food chain."

"Or it was never there," Jennings said.

"No," Park said. "There are signs. Bone fragments in the soil samples.
Coprolites. Tracks in a layer of sedimentary rock about a kilometer
inland. Something big lived here, and not too long ago — geologically
speaking."

"How long?"

"Hard to say without proper analysis. But my estimate? Ten to fifteen
thousand years."

A blink. A nothing. Whatever had removed the large fauna from this
planet had done it recently, and thoroughly.

They didn't find the ruins until the third day.

                              III.

Jennings spotted them from the air, during a survey flight over the
interior. Low mounds arranged in geometric patterns, visible only
from altitude, overgrown with the pale-trunked vegetation. Reeves
brought the shuttle in low and slow, and they circled the site twice
before setting down on a flat area that might once have been a plaza.

The ruins were extensive. A city, or what remained of one, spread
across a river valley in a grid pattern that spoke of planning, of
intention, of a civilization that had organized its space with care.
The structures were low — nothing rose more than three meters above
the ground — and built from a pale stone that blended so thoroughly
with the shadowless landscape that they were almost invisible at
ground level.

"No wonder the survey probe missed them," Park said, running her
scanner over the nearest wall. "In this light, with this stone, you'd
have to be standing right next to them to see them. No shadows to
give them definition."

The buildings were simple in form — rectangular, with wide doorways and
no windows. Reeves walked through one and found a single large room
with a smooth floor and walls covered in— something. Patterns.
Grooves cut into the stone in sweeping, flowing lines that covered
every surface from floor to ceiling.

"Art?" Jennings asked, running his fingers along the grooves.

"Or writing," Park said. "Or both. Or neither. We don't have a
framework for interpreting this."

They explored for hours. The city was larger than their initial
estimate — Park put it at roughly eight square kilometers, with a
population capacity she guessed at ten to twenty thousand. The
architecture was consistent throughout: low, wide buildings of pale
stone, no windows, wide doorways, walls covered in the flowing groove-
patterns. No furniture. No artifacts. No tools, no pottery, no
clothing, no bones. The city was empty — not just abandoned, but
cleaned. Everything portable had been removed.

Everything except the walls and their patterns.

"They left us a message," Reeves said, standing in the largest
structure they had found — a building at the center of the city, its
walls so densely covered in grooves that they looked like the pages
of a book compressed into stone. "They knew they were leaving, and
they left us this."

"Us?" Jennings said. "They didn't know about us."

"Someone. Anyone. Whoever came next." Reeves touched the wall. The
grooves were smooth, precise, cut by tools of considerable
sophistication. "They put everything they wanted to say into these
walls. And then they left."

"Left where?"

Nobody had an answer.

                              IV.

Park cracked it on the fifth day. Not the language — that would take
years, if it was possible at all. But the principle.

"It's tactile," she said, her voice carrying the particular excitement
of a scientist who has just realized that the puzzle is bigger than she
thought. "The grooves aren't meant to be seen. They're meant to be
felt."

She demonstrated. She placed her palm flat against the wall and moved
it slowly across the surface. The grooves passed beneath her skin —
ridges and valleys of varying width, depth, and spacing, creating a
complex tactile experience that was, Park argued, the equivalent of
reading Braille, but in two dimensions instead of one.

"Think about it," she said. "A species that evolved on this planet
would have reduced visual acuity for depth — no shadows, no shading,
minimal lighting contrast. Their eyes would be adapted for color and
motion, not for spatial definition. But their sense of touch—" She
held up her hand, wiggling her fingers. "In a world without shadows,
where vision is unreliable for spatial information, touch becomes the
primary sense for understanding three-dimensional structure. These
grooves are their writing. Their art. Their record. And it's all in
touch."

Reeves looked at the walls with new eyes. Not walls covered in
decoration. Walls covered in text. A library, written in a language
of touch, by a species that had evolved in a world where light came
from everywhere and shadows were a concept they had never known.

"A world without shadows," Reeves said quietly. "A species without the
concept of darkness."

Park nodded. "Their visual world would have been fundamentally different
from ours. No shadows means no visual metaphor for darkness, for
concealment, for the hidden and the unknown. Think about how much of
human culture is built on the shadow metaphor — shadow and light, dark
and bright, the shadow side of human nature, the dark night of the
soul. They wouldn't have had any of that."

"What would they have had instead?"

"I don't know. But whatever it was, it's in these walls. Their entire
cultural record, encoded in grooves. We're standing inside a
civilization's library, and we can't read a word of it."

Yet, Reeves thought. Yet.

                              V.

On the seventh day, the unease settled in.

It was Jennings who named it, though they had all been feeling it.
"This planet makes me nervous," he said, leaning against the shuttle's
hull. They were back at the coastal landing site. The two suns blazed
overhead, washing the world in their flat, depthless, shadowless light.
"I keep looking for shadows and they're not there. Every time I turn a
corner I expect to see my shadow on the ground and it's just — light.
Everywhere. No dark spots, no shade, no relief. It's like being on a
stage with all the lights up. Like there's no place to hide."

"Is that what bothers you?" Park asked. "That there's no place to
hide?"

"Yeah. Maybe. I don't know." He squinted at the sky. "On every world
I've ever been on, there's dark and light. Day and night, sun and
shadow. You know where you are because you can see your shadow on the
ground. It's like — proof. Proof that you're real, that you're there,
that you're blocking some of the light just by existing." He looked
down at his feet, at the shadowless ground beneath them. "Here, it's
like you don't quite exist. Like the world doesn't notice you're
standing on it."

Reeves understood. She had been feeling it too — a creeping wrongness,
not in the planet itself, which was lovely and hospitable and perfectly
safe, but in the light. In the relentless, even, omnidirectional light
that erased every shadow and flattened every surface and made the world
look like a painting with no depth. It was unsettling in a way that
was hard to articulate because it was so fundamental — like a wrong
note in a piece of music you've heard a thousand times. You couldn't
quite identify it, but you knew it was there.

And she thought about the species that had lived here. That had evolved
here, in this shadowless world, and had never known anything different.
For them, this flat, even, depthless light was normal. Was reality. Was
the only way a world could look. They had never cast a shadow. They
had never seen a shadow. They had never conceived of a shadow.

What did that do to a mind? What did that do to a consciousness? To
grow up in a world where light came from everywhere and darkness was,
quite literally, inconceivable?

She thought about Park's observation — that human culture was built on
the metaphor of shadow and light. Good and evil. Knowledge and
ignorance. The seen and the unseen. Plato's cave was a shadow play.
The Enlightenment was the triumph of light over dark. Every human
religion, every human philosophy, every human story was saturated with
the interplay of illumination and shadow.

Take that away. Erase the shadow from the mind of a species, and what
remained?

She didn't know. But the ruins in the valley, with their tactile walls
and their vanished builders, suggested an answer she wasn't sure she
was equipped to understand.

                              VI.

They stayed for three weeks. Park cataloged the ruins. Jennings
mapped the coastline and the interior from orbit. Reeves wrote her
report — the dry, factual language of a Pathfinder captain describing
a habitable world with ruins of a vanished civilization.

In the report, she stuck to the facts. Habitable planet. Binary star
system. Shadowless illumination. Ruins approximately ten to fifteen
thousand years old. No current intelligent life. Extensive tactile
records in stone, requiring specialist analysis.

She did not include her theory. It was not a theory, really — just a
feeling, an intuition, the kind of thing a Pathfinder captain learned
to recognize but not to trust. The feeling was this: the builders of
the city had not died out. They had not been destroyed by disease or
war or catastrophe. They had left.

The evidence was circumstantial but consistent. The city was cleaned,
not abandoned — everything portable removed, the walls preserved,
the structures intact. No bones, no mass graves, no signs of
violence or epidemic. The builders had departed in an orderly fashion,
taking everything they could carry, leaving behind only what was carved
in stone.

Where had they gone? Reeves didn't know. But she remembered the walls
and their flowing grooves, and she thought about a species that had
never known darkness, that had evolved in a world of total
illumination, and she wondered whether they had simply gone looking
for something they had never experienced.

A shadow. A patch of dark. The experience of standing in the light
and seeing proof, on the ground beside you, that you were real and
solid and present. The experience that every human took for granted
and that the builders of this city had never, in millions of years
of evolution, known.

Maybe they had gone looking for darkness. Maybe the whole city, the
whole civilization, had packed up and gone searching for a world
where the light didn't come from everywhere, where shadows fell and
things had depth and the universe acknowledged your existence by
letting you block a little bit of its light.

Or maybe not. Maybe they had left for reasons entirely their own, in
a framework of thought so alien that no human mind could follow it.

Reeves didn't put any of this in the report. She put in the facts and
let the specialists draw their own conclusions.

But on the last day, before they lifted off, she walked out onto the
white sand beach one final time. The two suns blazed overhead, close
together, washing the world in their flat, even, merciless,
shadowless light. She looked down at her feet. No shadow. Nothing on
the ground to prove she was there.

She stood for a long moment, feeling the strangeness of it, the
wrongness and the beauty and the loneliness of a world where nothing
cast a shadow and everything was equally lit and the darkness was
only in the places you couldn't see — in the deep ocean, in the
caves, in the spaces between the atoms of the pale stone walls
where a vanished people had carved their thoughts in grooves that
human hands could touch but human minds could not yet read.

Then she went back to the ship, and they lifted off, and the planet
fell away beneath them — blue and green and white, bright and
shadowless, turning its illuminated face to its twin suns like a
world with nothing to hide.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

CORDELL BEAUMONT is a writer from New Orleans whose fiction specializes
in the exotic, the sensory, and the beautiful. A graduate of Tulane
University and a veteran of the Pacific theater, he writes about alien
worlds with the intoxicated attention to detail that is the hallmark
of the born romantic. His stories have appeared in Planet Stories,
Startling Stories, and these pages, where he made his debut last year
with "The Vermillion Plateau" (Issue #10). He lives in the Faubourg
Marigny district of New Orleans with his wife, the painter Lisette
Beaumont, and reports that "The Cloud Kingdoms of Nephele" was
inspired by "watching thunderheads build over the Gulf on a summer
afternoon and wondering what it would be like to live inside one."

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is an astrophysicist at the California Institute
of Technology whose fiction has appeared in Astounding, Galaxy, and
every issue of this magazine since our third number. His stories are
distinguished by their rigorous scientific accuracy and their capacity
to find poetry in physics. He has published one novel, The Asymptote
(Doubleday, 1951), and is at work on a second. Of "Silicon Dreams" he
says: "The notion of a planetary computer is not as outlandish as it
might seem. Life, after all, is information processing. I have merely
proposed a substrate other than carbon." He keeps a tin toy rocket on
his desk at Caltech that his father made from a sardine can. It is
where it started.

DOUGLAS PEMBERTON is a humorist and essayist from Woking, Surrey — the
very town where Mr. Wells landed his Martians — who has been making
readers laugh since his debut in these pages with "The Automated Valet"
(Issue #8). His work has appeared in Punch, The New Yorker, Galaxy,
and The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. He is the author of
two comic novels, The Improbable Rise of Gerald Pock (Knopf, 1950)
and Misadventures in the Fourth Dimension (Knopf, 1952). He reports
that "The Taxman Cometh" was inspired by his own encounter with His
Majesty's Inland Revenue, which he describes as "an experience roughly
comparable to first contact with a hostile alien intelligence, except
that the aliens were more reasonable."

THEODORE CAIN is the hardest-working writer in science fiction, having
appeared in nearly every issue of this magazine since its inception.
A native of Detroit and a veteran of the European theater, he brings a
blue-collar work ethic and a craftsman's eye to every story he writes.
His range is remarkable: he is equally at home with hard science fiction,
space adventure, and — as this issue demonstrates — the mystery story.
"Tidal Lock" is his twentieth story for "Tales" and one of his finest.
He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean and their three
children, and writes every evening from eight until midnight, seven
days a week. When asked how he does it, he replies: "Same as the
factory. You show up and you do the work."

MARGARET THORNTON holds a master's degree in marine biology from the
University of Washington and brings a scientist's precision and a
poet's sensibility to her fiction, which has appeared in Astounding,
Galaxy, and New Worlds, as well as these pages. Her work is
distinguished by its deep ecological intelligence and its conviction
that the most alien landscapes are, at bottom, alive. "Children of the
Magnetic Field" represents a departure from her usual aquatic settings,
but her attention to the intricate relationships between organisms and
their environment remains as sharp as ever. She lives on Orcas Island
in the San Juan archipelago and is at work on a novel about a planet-
sized organism. "The Voltari came to me during an electrical storm,"
she writes. "I was watching the lightning over the Strait of Juan de
Fuca and I thought: what if someone were watching back?"

COL. JAMES "BUCK" STANTON (Ret.) is a decorated combat veteran who
flew P-51 Mustangs over Europe and commanded a fighter wing in Korea
before retiring from the United States Air Force and taking up the
pen. His military science fiction is distinguished by its unflinching
authenticity and its refusal to romanticize war even as it honors those
who fight. His stories have appeared exclusively in these pages, where
he debuted with "Sortie" (Issue #6) and has since become one of our
most distinctive voices. He lives on a ranch outside Fredericksburg,
Texas, with his wife Martha. Of "The Siege of Fortress Luna" he says
simply: "Every officer has nightmares about a Ravenel. The ones who
say they don't are lying."

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY is a Chicago-born pulp veteran who has been
writing action and adventure fiction since 1939, when he sold his
first story to Thrilling Wonder Stories at the age of twenty-two. His
work is fast, vivid, and unfailingly entertaining, and he makes no
apologies for any of it. His stories have appeared in Planet Stories,
Startling Stories, Thrilling Wonder Stories, and these pages, and he
has published too many stories under too many names to count. He lives
in Rogers Park, Chicago, with his wife Carol and an indeterminate
number of cats. Of "World Without Shadows" he says: "I've been to a
lot of strange planets in my time, but this one gave me the willies
worse than any of them. A world with no shadows? No thanks. I like
knowing where I stand."

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading Issue #14 and I must say that Dr. Koslov's
"The Hydrogen Cathedral" is the finest piece of hard science fiction I
have read this year. His description of the gas cloud's internal
structure is not merely plausible — it is beautiful. However, I must
point out that his calculation of the Jeans mass for the central
condensation appears to be off by a factor of approximately 1.4. This
does not affect the story's validity in the least, but I thought Dr.
Koslov would want to know. We physicists are a punctilious lot.

                              — Dr. Robert Halloran

                                 University of Chicago

Dear Max,

Pemberton's "The Committee for Interstellar Relations" (Issue #15) made
me laugh so hard that I woke my wife, who does not read science fiction
and does not appreciate being woken at midnight. I read her the passage
about the alien ambassador's attempt to file a formal complaint in
triplicate and she laughed too. You may count her as a convert. Please
tell Pemberton that his depiction of bureaucracy is, if anything,

Dear Editor,

I notice that in Theodore Cain's "Assembly Line" (Issue #15), the
robots on the assembly line are described as having "four articulated
manipulator arms." Later in the same story, one of the robots is
described as picking up an object with "its third and fourth hands."
Hands or arms? Mr. Cain should make up his mind. Otherwise, the story
was excellent and I would like to see more about the robots of his
Detroit.

                                 Cleveland, Ohio

[Editor's note: Mr. Cain writes to say that the robots have four
arms and four hands, one hand per arm, and that the distinction
between "manipulator arm" and "hand" reflects the workers'
different ways of talking about the same appendage. He thanks
Mrs. Ostrowski for her careful reading and her kind words. — M.S.]

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am a fourteen-year-old girl in Boise, Idaho, and I want to tell you
that Margaret Thornton's stories are my favorite things in the whole
magazine. "Greenfall" and "The Littoral Zone" made me want to study
biology when I grow up. I want to study alien planets and alien
creatures and write about them the way she does. Please print more
stories by Miss Thornton.

                              — Susan Ellerby
                                 Boise, Idaho

[Editor's note: Miss Ellerby, I could not agree more. You will find
Miss Thornton in fine form in this very issue. Study hard. — M.S.]

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement has produced what may be the definitive hard science fiction
novel — a story in which the science is not merely a backdrop but the
engine of the plot, the source of the wonder, and the substance of the
adventure. Set on the planet Mesklin, a massive oblate world where
gravity ranges from three times Earth-normal at the equator to nearly
seven hundred times at the poles, the novel follows the native Mesklinite
captain Barlennan as he undertakes a perilous journey across his world's
extreme terrain to recover a stranded human research probe. The physics
is rigorous, the world-building meticulous, and Barlennan is one of the
most memorable alien protagonists in the genre. If you have ever wanted
to know what it feels like to live on a world where the very ground
conspires against you, this is your book. Highest recommendation.

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Dr. Asimov, having done more than any living writer to establish the
robot as a respectable subject for serious fiction, now combines his
robot stories with the mystery genre and produces something quite
extraordinary. In a future New York — a vast, enclosed, subterranean
city — detective Elijah Baley must solve a murder with the help of
R. Daneel Olivaw, a robot so convincingly human that the uncanny
valley becomes a chasm. The mystery is solid, the future society
convincingly detailed, and the relationship between Baley and Daneel
is one of the most interesting partnerships in recent fiction. Dr.
Asimov demonstrates once again that the best science fiction is not
about gadgets but about people — even when some of those people happen
to be made of metal. Highly recommended.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $3.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Sturgeon has always been the most emotionally acute writer in our
field, and in this novel — assembled from three connected stories
including the remarkable "Baby Is Three" — he reaches new heights of
both feeling and invention. The premise is deceptively simple: a group
of misfit humans, each possessing a unique psychic ability, discover
that together they form a composite being greater than the sum of its
parts. What makes the novel extraordinary is not the science-fictional
concept but the depth and tenderness with which Sturgeon renders his
broken, lonely, desperate characters and their fumbling journey toward
connection and wholeness. This is a novel about what it means to be
human, and it answers the question with a compassion and an intelligence
that elevate it far above genre boundaries. Essential reading.

          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #17 — May 1954

We are pleased to announce the contents of our seventeenth issue, which
will be on newsstands in late April:

"THE IRON REEF" by Margaret Thornton — On an ocean world where the
coral is made of iron and the currents carry magnetic storms, a marine
biologist discovers that the reef is dying — and that its death may be
a metamorphosis. A story of ecology, wonder, and the resilience of
living systems.

"PERIHELION MINUS TEN" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A sequel to his
celebrated "Perihelion" (Issue #3). The same two-person crew, the same
damaged vessel, but this time the stakes are higher and the physics
even more demanding. Readers who have been asking for a return to this
world will not be disappointed.

"THE AUTOMATED AMBASSADOR" by Douglas Pemberton — When a robot
diplomat is assigned to negotiate a trade agreement with an alien
species that communicates exclusively through interpretive dance, the
results are predictably catastrophic and unpredictably hilarious.
Pemberton at his finest.

"SALVAGE RIGHTS" by Robert "Bob" Finley — A derelict ship drifting in
the asteroid belt turns out to be carrying a cargo that three different
factions will kill to possess. Finley delivers the goods: fast, furious,
and fun.

Plus: a new story by Rex Drummond, a provocative tale from Arthur
Wainwright, letters from our readers, book reviews, and more.
