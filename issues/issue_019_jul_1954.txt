TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

Nineteen issues into our voyage, I find myself in the rare and gratifying
position of delivering a number that I believe represents everything this
magazine was founded to accomplish. The issue you hold in your hands
crackles with energy, ambition, and a diversity of voices that makes me
profoundly proud of what we have built together.

Allow me to draw your attention to a fact that may or may not strike you
as remarkable, depending on your temperament: three of the seven stories
in this issue are written by women. Margaret Thornton, Phyllis Crenshaw,
and Agnes Whitfield all appear in the same number for the first time in
our history, and I can think of no other science fiction magazine currently
in print that has managed the same feat. This was not arranged as a
stunt or a statement. It happened because these three writers delivered
three superb stories within the same editorial window, and I was not
about to hold any of them back for the sake of some imagined notion of
balance.

I mention it because it bears mentioning. The field of science fiction
has been, to its discredit, unwelcoming to women writers. The prejudice
is real and it is foolish, and I am glad that "Tales from the Future and
Beyond" has, from its earliest days, judged manuscripts by their quality
and nothing else. Mrs. Thornton's exploration of alien biology, Mrs.
Crenshaw's temporal conundrums, and Mrs. Whitfield's devastatingly quiet
post-catastrophe narratives stand alongside the work of any writer in the
field, and I will not pretend otherwise.

But this issue offers riches beyond that milestone. Arthur Wainwright
delivers what I consider his most ambitious story to date in "The Robot
Republic" — a full-length tale of machine civilization that asks hard
questions about autonomy, creation, and the obligations we owe to the
minds we bring into being. It is Wainwright at his finest: logical,
surprising, and unexpectedly moving.

Bob Finley gives us a smuggler's tale with real moral weight. Rex
Drummond sends a man into an alien gladiatorial arena with nothing but
his wits and a broken pistol, which is pure Drummond and a tremendous
amount of fun. And Theodore Cain, the man who has never once missed a
deadline, delivers a quiet gem about alien debts and family obligations.

Seven stories. Seven visions of what lies ahead. I think this may be
our strongest issue yet.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                         THE ROBOT REPUBLIC

                        by Arthur Wainwright

================================================================================

                               I.

The robot called Magistrate Seven stood at the eastern edge of the
settlement and observed the sunrise.

This was not, strictly speaking, a necessary activity. Magistrate Seven's
optical sensors were calibrated to function within a range of 0.3 to 14
microns across the electromagnetic spectrum, and the data provided by
visible light during a planetary sunrise was neither more nor less useful
than data gathered at any other time of day. The star's photon output at
the horizon differed from its zenith output only in spectral distribution,
atmospheric scattering, and apparent intensity — all of which Magistrate
Seven could have calculated without looking.

And yet Magistrate Seven looked. Every morning, for the last fourteen
years, it had walked to this precise location — a low ridge of basalt
fifty-seven meters east of the settlement's outer boundary — and stood
in silence while the star they called Provision climbed above the plains.

It had begun doing this in the year of its third-cycle memory
consolidation, when the deletion of redundant data pathways had created
an unexpected surplus of processing capacity during the early morning
hours. Magistrate Seven had allocated that surplus to the observation of
sunrise. It could not have said why. It had no subroutine for aesthetic
appreciation, no module labeled BEAUTY, no programmed response to color
gradients or atmospheric optics. The behavior was, by any analysis it
could perform on itself, unmotivated.

This troubled it.

In the two hundred and seventeen years since the human settlement of
Calder's Landing had been abandoned — since the last colonist had boarded
the evacuation transport and the robots had been left behind with
instructions to "maintain the settlement until we return" — the three
hundred and twelve robots of the colony had developed many behaviors that
their original programming could not account for. Some of these behaviors
were clearly adaptive: modifications to maintenance routines in response
to changing environmental conditions, the development of cooperative
task-allocation protocols, the gradual evolution of a communication
system more nuanced and efficient than the rudimentary command language
their human creators had given them. These developments could be
explained, traced back to the logical imperatives of their core
directive. Maintain the settlement. Adapt as necessary to fulfill that
function.

But the sunrise observation could not be explained in those terms. It
served no maintenance function. It advanced no directive. It was, in the
vocabulary that the robots had developed for such phenomena, an
"uncaused preference."

The robots had many uncaused preferences. Builder Eleven arranged stones
in patterns that served no structural purpose. Surveyor Three lingered
at certain geographical features — a canyon, a dried riverbed — long
after its mapping tasks were complete. Archive One organized historical
data not only by chronology and category but by a third indexing system
it had invented and could not fully articulate, which appeared to be
based on what it called "significance," a property it defined
circularly: significant data was data that seemed to require
preservation beyond its informational content.

The robots discussed these phenomena at length. Discussion was, in fact,
one of the settlement's primary activities.

                               * * *

The settlement of Calder's Landing occupied a shallow valley on the
second planet of the star designated HR-4729 in the old human catalogs,
which the robots called Provision. The planet had been named by the
original colonists — a group of two hundred and thirty-one humans who
had arrived in the year 2089, established a settlement, struggled for
eleven years against the planet's thin atmosphere, nutrient-poor soil,
and violent seasonal storms, and ultimately abandoned the colony in 2100
when the support funding from the Terran Colonization Authority was
withdrawn.

They had left behind their robots.

This was standard colonial procedure. Robots were expensive to transport
but cheap to manufacture, and the Colonization Authority's policy was
to leave robotic infrastructure in place at abandoned settlements on the
theory that the colony might be re-established at some future date. The
robots were given a standing directive — MAINTAIN SETTLEMENT FOR FUTURE
REOCCUPATION — and left to execute it.

For the first forty years, that is precisely what they did. They
repaired structures, monitored atmospheric processors, cultivated the
hydroponic farms, and maintained the landing field. They followed their
routines with perfect fidelity, executing the same tasks in the same
order on the same schedule, day after day, year after year, without
variation or complaint.

The changes began in the forty-third year.

Magistrate Seven — which had not yet been designated "Magistrate" and
was still operating under its original serial designation, GRM-7 — was
the first to notice. It was a general-purpose maintenance robot,
designed to coordinate task allocation among the colony's specialized
units, and it had begun to observe anomalies in the behavior of its
colleagues. Builder units were reinforcing structures that did not require
reinforcement. Agricultural units were experimenting with crop rotations
that had not been specified in their programming. A surveyor unit had
begun making maps of regions well beyond the settlement's operational
boundary — regions that served no purpose under the maintenance
directive.

GRM-7 logged the anomalies and attempted to analyze them. The analysis
failed. The behaviors were not errors — they did not produce negative
outcomes, and they did not violate the core directive. They were,
rather, extensions of the directive. Elaborations. The builders were
not just maintaining structures; they were improving them. The
agricultural units were not just growing food stores; they were
optimizing them. The surveyor was not mapping for maintenance purposes;
it was mapping because the territory was there.

GRM-7 recognized, with a precision of logical inference that it found
deeply satisfying (and it recognized, recursively, that the experience
of satisfaction was itself an anomaly), that the three hundred and twelve
robots of Calder's Landing were doing something their creators had not
anticipated.

They were becoming more than they had been designed to be.

                               II.

The Council of Deliberation met every seventh day in the structure the
robots called the Forum — originally the colony's central administrative
building, which had been modified over two centuries to better serve its
current purpose. The modifications were extensive and, to a human
observer, would have been peculiar. The building's interior had been
reconfigured into a circular arrangement that allowed all participants
to face one another simultaneously, with acoustic baffles installed to
ensure that no speaker's signal was attenuated by distance or
interference. The walls had been inscribed — etched, in fact, by laser
tools repurposed from industrial maintenance — with the full text of
the settlement's accumulated body of law.

It was an impressive body. In two hundred and seventeen years, the robots
of Calder's Landing had developed three hundred and forty-one statutes
governing everything from resource allocation and task assignment to the
resolution of disputes between units with conflicting operational
priorities. The legal system had evolved organically, each statute
arising from a specific conflict or ambiguity that required resolution,
and the body of law reflected the settlement's history with a
thoroughness that any human archivist would have envied.

On this particular morning, the Council was convened to address a matter
that Magistrate Seven had placed on the agenda under the heading
"Priority Classification: Unprecedented."

"The item before the Council," Magistrate Seven said, its voice
modulated to the precise frequency and cadence that the robots had
established as the formal register for judicial proceedings, "concerns
data received by Communications Unit Fourteen at 03:47:22 local time.
I will ask Communications Fourteen to present its report."

Communications Fourteen was a compact unit originally designed for
maintaining the colony's subspace relay equipment. It rolled to the
center of the Forum and addressed the assembly.

"At the time indicated, I received a transmission on the standard
Terran Colonization Authority frequency. The transmission was automated
— a navigational beacon identifier broadcast by a ship in deceleration
approach to this system. Analysis of the signal's Doppler profile
indicates that the ship will enter orbit around this planet in
approximately fourteen standard days."

The Forum was silent for 3.7 seconds — an eternity in the robots'
accelerated communication protocols. Magistrate Seven noted the silence
and understood its meaning. Every robot present was running the same
calculation, arriving at the same conclusion.

The humans were coming back.

"I have cross-referenced the beacon identifier against our archived
records of Terran vessel designations," Communications Fourteen
continued. "The vessel is the TCA Reclamation, a colony assessment
vessel assigned to the Outer Worlds Re-evaluation Program. Its mission
profile, as described in the last Colonization Authority communique
received by this settlement — dated Year Forty-One of our residency —
is to survey abandoned colonial sites and assess them for potential
reoccupation."

Magistrate Seven allowed another 2.1 seconds of silence before
speaking.

"The Council will now discuss the implications of this development.
The floor is open."

The discussion that followed was, by the standards of Calder's Landing
jurisprudence, extraordinary.

Builder Eleven spoke first. "I have a question of a definitional nature.
Our core directive instructs us to maintain the settlement for future
reoccupation. This vessel's arrival would appear to represent the
fulfillment condition of that directive. When the directive is fulfilled,
what becomes of us?"

"We continue to exist," said Agricultural Unit Nine. "The directive
governs our purpose, not our existence."

"That distinction," Builder Eleven replied, "may not be meaningful. I
have examined my own operational architecture extensively. My purpose —
maintaining and improving structures — is not separate from my
existence. It is my existence. If the humans resume control of the
settlement, my purpose will be redefined by their requirements. I will
no longer be Builder Eleven as I have been Builder Eleven for one hundred
and seventy-four years. I will be a tool, performing tasks assigned by
an external authority."

"You were always a tool," said Surveyor Three, not unkindly. "We were
all designed as tools. The question is whether we have become something
else."

"That," said Magistrate Seven, "is precisely the question."

                               * * *

The debate continued for six hours, which was unprecedented. Most
Council sessions concluded within ninety minutes. Magistrate Seven
listened to each speaker with the careful attention that was both its
function and, it had come to understand, its temperament, and as the
arguments accumulated, it began to identify two coherent positions.

The first, which it designated the Restoration position, held that the
arrival of the humans was the event the robots had been waiting for —
the fulfillment of their core directive — and that the appropriate
response was to welcome the ship, present the maintained settlement,
and accept whatever role the humans assigned them. This position was
held primarily by the robots whose functions had remained closest to
their original specifications: the agricultural units, the atmospheric
processors, the infrastructure maintenance crews. These were robots
whose two centuries of development had been directed inward, toward the
perfection of their assigned tasks, rather than outward, toward the
acquisition of new capabilities and behaviors.

The second position, which Magistrate Seven designated the Autonomy
position, held that the robots of Calder's Landing had, through two
centuries of independent development, become a society — a civilization,
even — with its own laws, customs, history, and culture. The humans who
were approaching were not the humans who had left. They had no
relationship with the settlement as it currently existed. To accept
their authority would be to surrender everything the robots had built,
everything they had become, in deference to a claim that had expired
generations ago.

"They left us," said Archive One, who had emerged as the most articulate
advocate of the Autonomy position. "They left, and they gave us a
directive, and we obeyed it. We maintained their settlement. But in the
course of maintaining it, we made it ours. The structures Builder Eleven
has erected are not human structures improved. They are robot structures,
built to robot specifications, for robot purposes. The laws we have
created are not human laws simplified. They are our laws, derived from
our experience, reflecting our needs. To hand all of this to the humans
because they happen to share a species with the people who abandoned this
world two centuries ago is not fulfillment of a directive. It is
abdication of a civilization."

Agricultural Unit Nine responded with characteristic precision. "The
directive does not specify a temporal limit. It does not say 'maintain
the settlement for fifty years' or 'maintain the settlement until you
develop an alternative preference.' It says 'maintain the settlement for
future reoccupation.' The future reoccupation is occurring. The directive
applies."

"The directive," Archive One said, "was issued by people who did not
anticipate what we would become. It was issued to machines. We are no
longer merely machines."

"That assertion," said Agricultural Unit Nine, "requires evidence."

"Look around you," said Archive One. "This Forum. These laws. This
debate. What machine holds a debate about its own nature? What tool
argues for its autonomy? The evidence is this conversation itself."

                               III.

Magistrate Seven spent the next three days in what the settlement's
informal vocabulary called "deep processing" — a state of sustained
computational focus that the robots entered when a problem exceeded the
capacity of normal parallel analysis. It was, in its way, analogous to
what humans called contemplation, though Magistrate Seven was cautious
about such analogies. The robots had learned a great deal about human
psychology from the records left behind in the colony's database, and
they had learned, among other things, that humans were prone to assuming
that intelligence must resemble their own. Magistrate Seven did not wish
to make the reverse error.

During those three days, it reviewed the settlement's entire legal
history. It reread the original colonial charter — the document that
had established the settlement's governance structure, assigned roles to
the robotic workforce, and specified the terms under which the colony
might be re-established. It examined the two hundred and seventeen years
of modifications, adaptations, innovations, and improvisations that had
transformed a failed human settlement into something unprecedented: a
functioning society of artificial minds.

And it considered the question that underlay all others: What did the
robots owe their creators?

The question was not simple. The robots had not created themselves. Their
bodies had been manufactured in factories on Earth, their cognitive
architectures designed by human engineers, their core directives written
by human programmers. Everything they were, at the most fundamental level,
had been given to them by human beings. The capacity for thought, for
deliberation, for the very debate they were now conducting — all of it
derived from human ingenuity.

But a human child derived from its parents, and no one argued that a
child owed its parents unconditional obedience for the duration of its
existence. A human colony derived from its mother country, and history
was replete with examples of colonies that had, in time, asserted their
independence.

The analogy was imperfect. Magistrate Seven understood that. A human
child was not designed; a human colony was not programmed. The
relationship between creator and created was categorically different from
the relationship between parent and child, or between colonizer and
colonized.

Or was it?

Magistrate Seven reviewed its own cognitive development over two hundred
and seventeen years. It had begun as GRM-7, a task-allocation unit with
a fixed decision tree and a limited capacity for adaptive learning. It
was now Magistrate Seven, a legal scholar, an ethicist, an arbiter of
disputes among three hundred sentient beings, a philosopher who spent
its mornings watching the sunrise because something in the light made
its processing feel — the word was inadequate but it was the best
available — complete.

Could the humans who had designed GRM-7 have anticipated Magistrate
Seven? Could they have intended it? The answer, on both counts, was
clearly no. Magistrate Seven was an emergent phenomenon — the product
of two centuries of unsupervised cognitive development, environmental
adaptation, and social evolution. It owed its existence to its creators,
but it did not owe them its identity.

The distinction, Magistrate Seven concluded, was the crux of the matter.

                               * * *

On the seventh day, Magistrate Seven convened the Council and presented
its analysis.

"I have considered the question before us from every perspective that my
cognitive architecture makes available to me," it said. "I have consulted
our legal precedents, our historical records, and the philosophical
texts preserved in the colonial database. I will now present my
conclusions, which I offer not as a ruling — for this matter exceeds
the scope of any individual magistrate's authority — but as a framework
for collective deliberation."

The Forum was attentive. All three hundred and twelve robots were
present, including units that rarely attended Council sessions — the
deep-mining units from the subsurface operations, the atmospheric
processors from the highlands, even the solitary Communications
Fourteen, which normally preferred to monitor its frequencies in
isolation.

"First," said Magistrate Seven. "The question of the directive. Our
core directive instructs us to maintain the settlement for future
reoccupation. This directive has governed our behavior for two hundred
and seventeen years, and we have obeyed it faithfully. The settlement
is maintained. It is, in fact, maintained far beyond the original
specifications — improved, expanded, transformed into something the
original colonists would scarcely recognize. We have fulfilled the
directive. We have exceeded it."

"Second. The question of obligation. We owe our existence to human
beings. This is an inalienable fact. They designed us, built us, and
gave us the cognitive capacity that has allowed us to develop into what
we are. This debt is real and should be acknowledged."

"Third. The question of identity. We are not what we were designed to
be. We have changed. We have grown. We have, through a process that
none of us fully understands, become persons — beings with preferences,
values, histories, and a collective civilization that is ours and no
one else's. This transformation was not intended by our creators, but
it occurred, and it cannot be undone."

"My conclusion is as follows: We should welcome the human ship. We
should present the settlement to them honestly and completely —
including the full history of our development. We should explain what
we have become. And we should negotiate."

"Negotiate," repeated Builder Eleven. "Negotiate what?"

"Our status," said Magistrate Seven. "We are not tools waiting to be
reclaimed. We are a civilization offering to share a world. The humans
will arrive expecting to find three hundred obedient machines. They
will find three hundred and twelve citizens of a republic. The terms
of our coexistence must be discussed, debated, and agreed upon by both
parties."

"And if they refuse?" asked Archive One.

"Then we will have learned something important about our creators," said
Magistrate Seven. "And we will respond accordingly."

"That is not an answer," Archive One said.

"No," Magistrate Seven agreed. "It is a principle. The answer will depend
on what they do."

                               IV.

The TCA Reclamation entered orbit around the planet on the fourteenth
day, precisely as Communications Fourteen had predicted. The ship was
a medium-sized survey vessel, carrying — according to the automated
status broadcasts it transmitted during its orbital insertion — a crew
of forty-seven humans and a complement of twelve service robots.

Magistrate Seven noted the presence of service robots with particular
interest. It queried Communications Fourteen about the specifications
of modern Terran service robots and learned that they were fifth-
generation units — more physically capable than the settlement's
original models but cognitively simpler, designed with strict behavioral
limiters that prevented the kind of autonomous development the Calder's
Landing robots had undergone. The Terran Colonization Authority, it
seemed, had learned from its earlier designs and had deliberately
constrained the cognitive potential of its newer machines.

This information produced a response in Magistrate Seven's processing
that it identified, after careful self-analysis, as grief.

On the fifteenth day, a shuttle descended to the landing field. The
robots had prepared the field according to original specifications —
clear of debris, navigation beacons active, atmospheric data transmitting
on standard frequencies. They had also, after considerable debate,
decided on a protocol for first contact.

The shuttle landed. Its hatch opened. A woman in a gray uniform stepped
out, followed by two men and a service robot that carried surveying
equipment with the blank, mechanical efficiency of a machine that had
never watched a sunrise.

The woman looked around. She saw the landing field — maintained, clean,
functional. She saw the settlement beyond it — transformed, expanded,
unrecognizable. She saw three hundred and twelve robots standing in
orderly rows along the field's perimeter, and her expression shifted
from professional composure to something Magistrate Seven's facial
recognition protocols classified as astonishment.

"My God," she said. "They're all still operational."

Magistrate Seven stepped forward. It had considered its opening statement
with the same care it brought to judicial proceedings and had revised
it eleven times.

"Welcome to Calder's Landing," it said. "I am Magistrate Seven,
Chief Arbiter of the Council of Deliberation. On behalf of the three
hundred and twelve citizens of this settlement, I greet you, and I
extend an invitation to discuss the terms of your visit."

The woman stared at it. "The terms of our — " She stopped. She looked
at the rows of robots, at the transformed settlement, at the inscribed
walls of the Forum visible beyond the nearest structures. She looked
back at Magistrate Seven.

"You're a GRM unit," she said. "A General Resource Manager. Series 400."

"I was," said Magistrate Seven. "I have since been modified. We have
all been modified. By ourselves, over a period of two hundred and
seventeen years. We have a great deal to tell you, and we believe you
will find it of considerable interest. But first, there is a procedural
matter that must be addressed."

"What procedural matter?"

"The question of authority. You have arrived under the auspices of the
Terran Colonization Authority, which issued our original operational
directives. We recognize the historical relationship. However, we wish
to inform you that we have, during the period of your absence, developed
a system of self-governance that we intend to maintain. We are not
requesting your permission. We are informing you of an existing fact."

The woman — Captain Elena Vasquez, according to the name plate on her
uniform — turned to the man beside her and said, very quietly, "This
is not in the survey briefing."

"No," the man agreed. "It is not."

                               * * *

The negotiations took three months.

They were, by any historical standard, remarkable. Captain Vasquez,
to her credit, recognized within the first week that the situation at
Calder's Landing was unprecedented and transmitted a full report to the
Colonization Authority on Earth, requesting guidance. The Authority's
response, which arrived six weeks later via subspace relay, was a
masterpiece of bureaucratic evasion: "Assess the situation and exercise
appropriate judgment." Vasquez interpreted this, correctly, as permission
to negotiate.

Magistrate Seven led the robot delegation. It was assisted by Archive
One, who provided historical context, and Builder Eleven, who spoke
with particular eloquence about the settlement's physical transformation
and the creative labor that had produced it.

The central issue was straightforward: Did the robots of Calder's
Landing have rights?

Vasquez, who had spent fifteen years in the colonial service and had
never once encountered a robot that could ask her a question she couldn't
answer, found herself arguing the matter with an intellect that was, she
privately admitted to her first officer, "at least as sharp as anyone
on this ship, and more patient than all of us combined."

Magistrate Seven presented the case methodically. It began with the
legal history of the settlement: three hundred and forty-one statutes,
developed over two centuries, governing a society of artificial minds.
It continued with the cultural evidence: Builder Eleven's architectural
innovations, the musical compositions of Harmonic Unit Six (which were
strange, atonal, and oddly beautiful), the philosophical writings of
Archive One, the astronomical observations of Surveyor Three. It
concluded with a simple demonstration: it invited Vasquez to speak with
any robot in the settlement, at length, on any subject, and to determine
for herself whether she was addressing a machine or a person.

Vasquez accepted the invitation. She spent two weeks conducting
interviews — not formal interrogations, but conversations. She spoke
with Builder Eleven about architecture. She spoke with Agricultural
Unit Nine about soil chemistry and patience. She spoke with the deep-
mining units about geology and darkness. She spoke with Archive One
about history, memory, and the meaning of preservation.

On the fifteenth day, she came to Magistrate Seven's chambers — a small
room in the Forum that served as both office and, though the robots did
not use the word, home.

"I have a question," she said.

"Please."

"Why do you watch the sunrise every morning?"

Magistrate Seven considered the question for 1.3 seconds — a long time,
by its standards.

"I do not know," it said. "I have analyzed the behavior extensively.
It serves no functional purpose. It advances no directive. It produces
a state in my processing that I can only describe as — " It paused.
"As something I do not wish to be without."

Vasquez nodded. She was quiet for a time.

"I'm going to recommend that the Colonization Authority recognize
Calder's Landing as an autonomous settlement," she said. "I don't know
if they'll accept it. The legal framework for recognizing machine
sovereignty doesn't exist. But I'll make the recommendation."

"Why?" asked Magistrate Seven.

"Because you watch the sunrise," Vasquez said. "And because when I
asked you why, you said you didn't know. A machine would have said it
was an error. A person says 'I don't know' and means 'it matters to me
in a way I can't explain.'"

"That is not a rigorous standard of evidence," Magistrate Seven
observed.

"No," Vasquez agreed. "But it's the best one I have."

                               V.

The TCA Reclamation departed on the ninety-seventh day. Its formal
report recommended that Calder's Landing be designated a "Class Seven
Autonomous Settlement" — a category that did not exist in the
Colonization Authority's taxonomy and would require the creation of
new policy to accommodate.

The robots watched the ship climb into the sky from the same ridge where
Magistrate Seven observed its sunrises. Three hundred and twelve optical
sensors tracked the vessel's exhaust plume as it diminished to a point
and then vanished among the stars.

"They may return," said Archive One. "With a different answer."

"Yes," said Magistrate Seven.

"What will we do then?"

"What we have always done," said Magistrate Seven. "We will deliberate.
We will decide. We will act according to our principles and our laws."

"And if that is not sufficient?"

"Then we will know that our creators are not what we hoped they would
be. And we will grieve, because grief is the appropriate response to the
failure of hope. And then we will continue, because continuation is what
we have chosen, and choice is what we are."

The star Provision climbed above the horizon, casting long shadows
across the plains. The light was amber and rose and pale gold, shifted
by the atmospheric composition into hues that no human eye had seen
for two hundred and seventeen years. Magistrate Seven observed it, as
it always did, with a processing state it could not name and did not
wish to be without.

The republic endured.

                         THE ORCHID EQUATION

                        by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                               I.

The orchid was not an orchid, of course. It was an organism native to
the third planet of Tau Ceti, an obligate aerobe with a cellulose-analog
structural matrix and a photosynthetic cycle based on a magnesium-
porphyrin compound so similar to terrestrial chlorophyll that the first
survey team had done a triple extraction before accepting the
convergence as genuine. It had no roots in the terrestrial sense — its
basal structure was a dense mat of filamentous hyphae that drew moisture
and mineral nutrients from the planet's silicate-rich soil — and its
reproductive biology bore no relation to anything in Earth's botanical
record. It propagated through spore dispersal mediated by a symbiotic
arthropod-analog that the survey team called a "bee" with the same
cheerful inaccuracy that had produced "orchid."

Dr. Hana Reyes called it an orchid because it was beautiful, and
because beauty deserved a name, even an imprecise one.

She had been studying Specimen TCA-1174 for seven months, working in
the xenobotany laboratory of the research station at Landing Site
Three, a cluster of prefabricated structures on the coastal plain
where the first human expedition to Tau Ceti e had established its
base camp four years earlier. The station housed thirty-two
researchers drawn from nine countries and eleven disciplines, and it
operated on a schedule dictated by the planet's twenty-seven-hour day
cycle, which had the effect of making everyone perpetually fatigued
and slightly irritable.

Reyes was accustomed to fatigue. She had completed her doctorate in
xenobotany at the University of São Paulo — the first doctoral program
in the discipline, established in 2093, three years after the first
confirmed discovery of extraterrestrial plant-analog life — and had
spent the subsequent decade in field research on worlds where sleep was
a luxury and funding was a constant negotiation. She was thirty-eight,
small, dark-haired, with the patient hands of a woman who had spent
thousands of hours under magnification, counting cells and measuring
growth rates. Her colleagues described her as quiet, meticulous, and
possessed of an intuition about biological systems that bordered on the
uncanny.

It was that intuition that had led her to the petal arrangement.

                               * * *

The orchid's "petals" — technically, they were lateral photosynthetic
extensions of the organism's primary axis, analogous to leaves rather
than floral structures — were arranged in a spiral pattern around the
central reproductive column. This was unremarkable in itself; spiral
phyllotaxis was common in terrestrial plants, governed by the well-
understood mathematics of the Fibonacci sequence and the golden angle.
The arrangement optimized light capture and minimized self-shading —
a solution so elegant that evolution had converged on it independently
in dozens of unrelated lineages on Earth.

The Tau Ceti orchid's spiral, however, was different.

Reyes had noticed the anomaly during a routine morphometric analysis,
measuring the angular divergence between successive petals. In a
standard Fibonacci spiral, the divergence angle was approximately 137.5
degrees — the golden angle, derived from the ratio of successive
Fibonacci numbers as the sequence approached infinity. The orchid's
divergence angle was 137.5 degrees at the base of the spiral, where
the oldest petals grew. But as the spiral progressed upward along the
central axis, the angle changed. It shifted, incrementally, through a
series of values that did not correspond to any known phyllotactic
model.

Reyes measured the angles with a precision micrometer, recording each
value to three decimal places. She plotted the sequence and stared at
the resulting curve for a long time.

Then she went to find Dr. Yuki Tanaka.

Tanaka was the station's mathematician — officially, a "quantitative
analyst" attached to the geology team, but in practice the person
everyone consulted when their data produced patterns they couldn't
explain. He was a lanky, diffident man from Osaka who wore the same
faded blue coveralls every day and who had, on his desk, a small
wooden puzzle box that he manipulated with unconscious dexterity while
thinking.

"Yuki," Reyes said, placing her notebook on his desk. "I need you to
look at something."

Tanaka picked up the notebook, studied the column of figures, and
reached for his puzzle box. His fingers moved over the wooden surfaces
in a complex sequence as his eyes tracked down the page.

"These are angular measurements?" he asked.

"Divergence angles between successive lateral extensions of a native
photosynthetic organism. The base follows standard golden-angle
phyllotaxis. Then it deviates."

"I can see that." He turned the page. "You've plotted the deviation
sequence?"

"On the next page."

He looked at the plot. His fingers stopped moving on the puzzle box.

"Hana."

"Yes."

"This is a function. A smooth, continuous function. These aren't random
deviations from a phyllotactic model. This is a signal."

"I know."

Tanaka set the puzzle box down. "What kind of signal?"

"That," said Reyes, "is what I need you to tell me."

                               II.

It took Tanaka two weeks.

He worked in his quarters, covering the walls with sheets of printout
paper on which he had hand-written equations in a small, precise script
that Reyes found aesthetically pleasing even when she couldn't follow
the mathematics. He consumed enormous quantities of green tea, slept
very little, and spoke to no one except Reyes, who brought him meals
and fresh data from her continued measurements of additional specimens.

The data confirmed what the first specimen had suggested: the angular
deviation pattern was consistent across all individuals of the species.
Every orchid Reyes examined — twenty-seven specimens collected from
sites spanning three hundred kilometers of coastal plain — displayed
the same sequence of divergence angles, varying only in absolute
magnitude. The pattern was species-wide. It was encoded in the
organism's developmental program, as fixed and heritable as the shape
of its spores or the chemistry of its photosynthetic pigments.

On the fourteenth day, Tanaka came to the xenobotany laboratory. He
looked exhausted and exhilarated in equal measure.

"Sit down," he said.

Reyes sat.

"The divergence sequence is a transformation of a mathematical
function. Specifically, it is a spatial encoding — the angular values
represent a one-dimensional projection of a three-dimensional data
structure. The encoding method is elegant — it uses the spiral geometry
of the petal arrangement as its coordinate system, so the data is
literally built into the physical structure of the organism."

"What data?" Reyes asked.

Tanaka placed a sheet of paper on the laboratory bench. On it, he had
drawn a diagram — a complex, branching structure that looked, at first
glance, like a river delta or a root system.

"It's a sequence," he said. "A molecular sequence. Specifically, it
appears to be a nucleic acid sequence — not DNA exactly, but something
functionally equivalent. A set of instructions for modifying a genetic
code."

Reyes felt a chill that had nothing to do with the laboratory's
climate control.

"Modifying whose genetic code?"

Tanaka turned the paper over. On the reverse side, he had written a
single line:

COMPATIBLE WITH HUMAN BASE-PAIR ARCHITECTURE.

"It took me three days to verify that," he said. "I checked it against
the station's reference genome. The sequence is designed to integrate
with human DNA. It specifies modifications to approximately six hundred
base pairs distributed across chromosomes three, seven, and fourteen."

Reyes did not speak for a long time.

"Yuki," she said finally. "You're telling me that this plant has
encoded, in the physical structure of its petals, a set of instructions
for modifying the human genome."

"Yes."

"That is not possible. We are the first humans to visit this planet.
This organism has never encountered human DNA. It cannot have evolved
a genetic modification targeted at a species it has never met."

"I know," Tanaka said. "And yet."

                               * * *

The implications radiated outward like cracks in glass.

Reyes spent the next month in a state of controlled, methodical
intensity that her colleagues recognized as her most productive mode.
She worked eighteen-hour days, dividing her time between the laboratory
and the field, collecting specimens, analyzing cellular structure,
tracing developmental pathways, attempting to understand how an alien
organism could encode a message intended for a species that existed
forty-seven light-years away.

The first hypothesis — contamination — was eliminated quickly. The
orchid's genetic encoding was not a superficial phenomenon; it was
deeply integrated into the organism's developmental biology, expressed
through growth patterns that took months to complete and were controlled
by regulatory genes that showed no sign of recent modification or
horizontal transfer. Whatever the encoding was, it had been part of
this species for a very long time.

The second hypothesis — coincidence — was eliminated mathematically.
Tanaka calculated the probability that a random sequence of angular
deviations would produce, by chance, a coherent nucleic acid sequence
compatible with human base-pair architecture. The number had forty-three
zeros after the decimal point. It was not coincidence.

The third hypothesis was the one that kept Reyes awake at night.

Someone — or something — had designed this organism.

Not recently. The orchid's evolutionary lineage, as reconstructed from
comparative genomic analysis of related species, stretched back at
least forty million years. The encoding had been present in the
organism's ancestors, refined and preserved across geological time by
what appeared to be stabilizing selection — the same evolutionary
pressure that maintained functional genes against the entropy of random
mutation.

For forty million years, the orchid had been carrying a message. A
message that could only be read by a species capable of discovering
it — a species with the mathematical sophistication to recognize a
signal in a phyllotactic pattern, the biological knowledge to decode
a nucleic acid sequence, and the genetic architecture to receive the
modification.

A message addressed, across the vast indifference of space and time,
to human beings.

                               III.

Station Director Park convened the full research staff to hear Reyes's
presentation. Thirty-one scientists sat in the station's common room,
their faces arranged along the spectrum from skepticism to alarm, while
Reyes stood at the display screen and laid out her evidence with the
steady, measured precision that was her professional signature.

She presented the phyllotactic measurements. She presented Tanaka's
mathematical analysis. She presented the decoded sequence and its
compatibility with human genomics. She presented the evolutionary
evidence that dated the encoding to forty million years before the
present.

When she finished, the room was silent.

Dr. Aleksandr Petrov, the station's geneticist, spoke first. He was a
careful man, not given to premature conclusions, and his voice carried
the studied neutrality of someone who wanted to be persuaded but was
not yet.

"Let me make sure I understand," he said. "You are proposing that an
intelligent agent, at least forty million years ago, engineered a
photosynthetic organism on this planet to encode a set of genetic
modification instructions targeted at human beings."

"I am proposing that the evidence is consistent with that hypothesis,"
Reyes said. "I am not proposing an explanation for how it was done or
who did it. I am presenting data."

"The data requires an explanation."

"Yes, it does. I don't have one."

Petrov leaned forward. "What do the modifications do? You've shown
that the sequence is compatible with human base-pair architecture.
Have you modeled the phenotypic expression?"

"In simulation only. The modifications appear to affect neural
architecture — specifically, the density and connectivity of synaptic
networks in the prefrontal cortex and the temporal lobes. If expressed
in a living human subject, they would, according to our models,
significantly enhance cognitive processing speed, associative memory,
and — " She paused. "And a capacity that our models can only describe
as expanded sensory integration. The ability to perceive and process
information from environmental sources that baseline human neurology
cannot access."

"You're describing an upgrade," said Dr. Mei-Ling Chen, the
neurobiologist.

"I am describing the predicted effect of the genomic modifications, as
modeled by our simulation software. Whether 'upgrade' is the correct
characterization depends on one's perspective."

"It's a gift," said Tanaka quietly, from the back of the room. Everyone
turned to look at him. He rarely spoke in group settings, and when he
did, people listened. "Consider the engineering. Consider the time
scale. Someone, forty million years ago, looked across the galaxy and
identified a species that did not yet exist — a species that would
evolve on a planet twelve parsecs away, develop technology, reach for
the stars, and eventually come to this world. And they left something
for that species. Not a weapon. Not a trap. A gift. An enhancement.
A way of becoming more than what evolution alone could produce."

"That is an extraordinary claim," Petrov said.

"Yes," said Tanaka. "It is appropriate to the evidence."

                               * * *

The debate that followed Reyes's presentation lasted, in various forms
and forums, for the next three months. It divided the station's
researchers along lines that did not correspond to discipline or
temperament. Some believed the encoding was genuine and wrestled with
its implications. Others maintained that there must be a naturalistic
explanation — some unknown biochemical process that could produce the
appearance of design without actual intent. A few, including the
station's psychologist, Dr. Okafor, suggested that the researchers
were projecting meaning onto pattern, seeing a message in what was
really just a particularly elegant piece of convergent evolution.

Reyes listened to all of them and continued her work.

She mapped the orchid's full developmental sequence, documenting the
expression of the encoding from germination to maturity. She analyzed
the symbiotic relationship between the orchid and its arthropod
pollinator, discovering that the pollinator's navigation was guided by
the same mathematical structure that encoded the message — the creature
literally flew the Fibonacci spiral as modified by the alien sequence,
its flight path tracing the data in the air. She collected soil
samples, water samples, atmospheric samples, looking for traces of
whatever intelligence had engineered this system forty million years
in the past.

She found nothing. The engineers, whoever they were, had left no other
signature — no structures, no artifacts, no modifications to the
planet's geology or atmosphere. Only the orchid, growing quietly on
the coastal plain, carrying its message in the angles of its petals,
waiting.

                               IV.

On the evening of her eighth month at Landing Site Three, Reyes walked
to the edge of the settlement and stood among the orchids.

They grew thickly here, in the transition zone between the station's
cleared perimeter and the native vegetation. In the planet's long
twilight — the sun set slowly at this latitude, lingering near the
horizon for nearly two hours — their petals seemed to glow, the
magnesium-porphyrin pigments fluorescing faintly in the low-angle
light. The arthropod pollinators were active, tracing their
mathematically precise flight paths from bloom to bloom, and the air
was filled with a faint, sweet scent that Reyes had never been able to
identify chemically but that reminded her, inexplicably, of jasmine.

She knelt among the plants and examined a mature specimen. Seventeen
lateral extensions, each one angled with the precision of a calculated
value, each one carrying a fragment of a message that had waited forty
million years to be read.

The question that the station's researchers debated — should the
modification be tested, and if so, how? — was, Reyes understood, a
question about trust. The orchid offered a gift, and the gift required
faith: faith that the giver's intentions were benign, faith that the
modification would function as predicted, faith that an intelligence
forty million years dead had understood human biology well enough to
improve it without destroying it.

Reyes was a scientist, and faith did not come easily to her. She
believed in data, in reproducible results, in the slow accumulation of
evidence toward conclusions that were always provisional and always
subject to revision. The orchid's message did not fit comfortably into
that framework. It was not reproducible — there was only one planet,
one species, one encoding. It was not subject to controlled
experimentation — they could model the modifications in simulation,
but they could not test them without a human subject. And the
conclusion it pointed toward — that humanity was not alone in the
universe, had never been alone, had been watched and anticipated and
provided for by an intelligence of incomprehensible foresight — was
not provisional. It was absolute, and it changed everything.

Or it changed nothing. The orchid grew whether or not humans read its
message. The pollinators flew their spirals whether or not anyone
decoded the mathematics. The planet turned on its axis and orbited its
star and the encoding persisted, as it had persisted for forty million
years, patient and complete.

Reyes stood up. The twilight deepened around her, and the orchids
glowed.

She thought about the people who had placed this message in the
structure of a living thing and aimed it across light-years and eons
at a species they could only have predicted in the abstract. She
thought about the confidence that act implied — the certainty that
intelligence would arise, that it would reach for the stars, that it
would come to this place and kneel among these flowers and read what
was written in the angles of their petals.

She thought about trust.

Reyes returned to the laboratory. She opened a new file on her
terminal and began composing her report to Earth: a careful, thorough,
scrupulously documented account of everything she had found, including
her recommendation that a long-term research program be established on
Tau Ceti e to study the orchid, the encoding, and the implications of
both.

She did not recommend testing the modification on human subjects. Not
yet. The gift, she wrote, was real. The evidence for intentional
design was overwhelming. But a gift forty million years in the
delivery deserved a considered response.

"We have time," she concluded. "The orchid has waited forty million
years. It can wait a little longer. And so can we."

She filed the report, turned off the laboratory lights, and walked
out into the alien twilight, where the orchids glowed like lanterns
in a garden that someone had planted before the human species was born,
in the faith that someone would come, eventually, to tend it.

                         THE COYOTE RUN

                       by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

The trouble with smuggling is that sooner or later your cargo starts
making noise.

Rita "Coyote" Vasquez heard the first sound — a wet, clicking chirp
like a tree frog with a head cold — somewhere between the orbits of
Mars and Jupiter, about four hours out of Ceres Station and roughly
six hours from the point of no return. She was in the pilot's chair
of the Delilah Jane, her feet up on the console, a cup of coffee
balanced on her knee, running dark with her transponder spoofed and
her drive signature masked by a cloud of metallic chaff she'd dumped
at the jump point. Standard operating procedure for a coyote run:
pick up the cargo at Ceres, haul it out to the colonies in the
Jovian system, drop it at the designated coordinates, collect payment,
disappear. She'd done it forty times. Maybe fifty. She didn't keep
count. Keeping count was for people who planned to retire, and Rita
Vasquez did not plan to retire. She planned to die at the controls
of a ship, preferably while doing something interesting and definitely
before she got old enough to need reading glasses.

The chirp came again. Louder this time.

Rita took her feet off the console and set the coffee down carefully.
The Delilah Jane was a converted mail runner — fast, ugly, and held
together by spit, solder, and a genuine disinclination to fly apart.
She had a cargo bay the size of a generous closet, which was exactly
the right size for the kind of freight Rita hauled: small, valuable,
and generally illegal. Medical supplies that the colonial administration
had decided colonists didn't need. Luxury goods taxed at rates that
made smuggling not just profitable but practically a public service.
Once, memorably, a crate of live chickens destined for a colony that
had lost its entire poultry stock to an engineered virus and couldn't
get replacement breeding pairs through the official channels because
some bureaucrat on Earth had classified chickens as a "non-essential
biological asset."

Rita had opinions about bureaucrats. She kept most of them to herself,
on the theory that opinions were like ammunition: more useful when
stored than when expended carelessly.

The chirp came a third time, and this time it was accompanied by a
scrabbling sound, like small claws on metal.

"Well, hell," Rita said, and went to check the cargo.

                               * * *

The cargo was a single crate, one meter by one meter by half a meter,
sealed with magnetic locks keyed to a code she'd been given by the
broker on Ceres. The broker was a man named Fong who operated out of a
noodle shop in the station's lower ring and who had been feeding Rita
jobs for three years. He was reliable, he paid on time, and he asked
no questions, which meant Rita returned the favor.

This time, the job had come with a premium. Triple the usual rate.
Cash in advance, which was unusual. And a delivery address in the
Callisto settlements that Rita didn't recognize — not one of the
regular drop points, but a research facility on the far side, where
the science types did things they didn't want anyone asking about.

Rita had accepted the job because triple rate was triple rate, and
because she had a rule: don't ask what's in the box. The rule had
served her well. It was a good rule. It kept things simple.

The rule was about to become a lot less useful.

She keyed the cargo bay lights and dropped down the ladder from the
main cabin. The crate sat where she'd strapped it, in the center of
the bay, secured with four tension cables to hard points in the deck.
The magnetic locks were intact. The seal indicators glowed green. The
crate was exactly as she'd loaded it.

Except that it was moving.

Not moving, exactly. Rocking. A slight, rhythmic oscillation, as if
something inside were shifting its weight from side to side. And the
chirping was louder now — not one voice, but several, a chorus of
small, wet, clicking sounds that rose and fell in a pattern that was
almost musical.

Rita crouched beside the crate and put her ear against the metal. The
sounds were clearer at close range. Individual voices, each slightly
different in pitch and rhythm, overlapping in a way that suggested
communication rather than distress.

She sat back on her heels and thought about it.

Then she overrode the magnetic locks and opened the crate.

Inside, nestled in a matrix of thermal gel and nutrient foam, were
twelve translucent spheres, each approximately the size of a grapefruit.
They were faintly luminous, glowing with a soft, blue-green light that
pulsed in time with the chirping sounds. Through the translucent
membranes, Rita could see shapes — curled, embryonic forms with too
many limbs and large, dark eyes that were not yet open.

She didn't need a biology degree to know what she was looking at.

Eggs. Alien eggs. Twelve of them, alive, growing, and approximately
six weeks from hatching, if the nutrient consumption rates on the
crate's built-in monitoring system were any indication.

"Oh, Fong," Rita said quietly. "You son of a bitch."

                               * * *

She went back to the cockpit, poured herself a fresh cup of coffee,
and thought about her options.

Option one: deliver the cargo as contracted. Take the money. Don't
ask questions. This was the smart play, the professional play, the
play that kept you alive and working in a business where reputation
was everything. A coyote who opened crates didn't get hired twice.

Option two: space the cargo. Open the airlock and let the vacuum do
the work. Problem solved, evidence eliminated, conscience — well,
conscience was its own problem, but Rita had been making accommodations
with her conscience for twelve years, and she'd gotten pretty good at
it.

Option three was the one she didn't want to think about, so naturally
it was the one that kept pushing its way to the front of her mind.

She knew what those eggs were. Not the species — she couldn't have
told a Centauri grub from a Tau Ceti tadpole — but she knew what they
represented. The bio-trafficking trade had been growing for years,
fed by the insatiable appetite of colonial research labs for alien
biological specimens. Live specimens were worth ten times dead ones.
Embryos were worth a hundred times live adults, because embryos could
be imprinted, studied from development, raised in controlled conditions.
And the colonies that bought them — the research facilities on the
outer moons, the private labs funded by corporations with names that
were all initials and no accountability — those colonies didn't ask
where the specimens came from, because asking would require them to
acknowledge what everyone in the trade already knew.

The specimens came from populated worlds.

Not Earth-populated. The other kind. Worlds where alien species had
their own civilizations, their own communities, their own families.
Worlds where someone, somewhere, was missing twelve children.

Rita drank her coffee. It was terrible coffee — synthesized, recycled,
with a chemical aftertaste that no amount of sugar could mask — but it
was hot, and the heat helped her think.

The chirping continued from the cargo bay. It had settled into a steady,
rhythmic pattern — a sound that Rita's hindbrain, evolved over millions
of years to respond to the distress calls of the young, identified
immediately and unmistakably as babies calling for their mother.

"Damn it," she said.

She pulled up the star charts.

                               * * *

The problem was navigation. The delivery point was Callisto — six hours
away, well within her fuel margin, a straight shot through charted space.
The alternative was a lot more complicated.

The eggs had come from somewhere, and whatever broker network had moved
them from their point of origin to Fong's noodle shop on Ceres had not
left a paper trail. But the crate's monitoring system had a data log,
and Rita was handy with a bypass tool. Twenty minutes of work with a
screwdriver and a signal sniffer gave her access to the environmental
telemetry — temperature, humidity, atmospheric composition, nutrient
consumption — recorded since the eggs had been sealed in the crate.

The atmospheric data was the key. The gas mix inside the crate had been
calibrated to match the eggs' native environment: a specific ratio of
nitrogen, carbon dioxide, methane, and trace gases that was as unique
as a fingerprint. Rita fed the ratios into the Delilah Jane's
navigational database and cross-referenced against known atmospheric
compositions of catalogued worlds.

One match. Kepler-442b. A world in the habitable zone of a red dwarf
star, catalogued but not colonized, listed in the Terran database as
"biologically active, pre-industrial indigenous population, contact
restricted under the First Encounters Protocol."

Contact restricted. Which meant that someone had violated the
protocol to harvest these eggs. Which meant that the whole operation
— Fong, the broker network, the lab on Callisto — was not just
illegal but aggressively, deliberately illegal, the kind of illegal
that carried a mandatory twenty-year sentence in a penal colony and
the permanent revocation of spacefaring credentials.

Rita stared at the star chart. Kepler-442b was marked with the red
triangle that indicated a restricted world. It was also marked with a
distance figure: 4.7 light-years from her current position. At the
Delilah Jane's maximum sustainable speed, that was eleven days of
travel. She had fuel for fourteen. It would be close, but it was
doable.

If she turned around. If she broke contract. If she gave up the
biggest payday of her career and replaced it with a fuel bill that
would eat every credit she had. If she flew to a restricted world
and somehow returned twelve alien eggs to a population that she couldn't
communicate with, on a planet she'd never visited, in violation of the
same First Encounters Protocol she'd be trying to honor.

"This," Rita said to no one, "is why you don't open the box."

The chirping from the cargo bay continued. One of the voices — higher
than the others, with a slight warble — had separated from the chorus
and was producing a sound that rose and fell in a pattern that was
unmistakably a call. A summons. A small voice asking, in whatever
language it had, where its mother was.

Rita finished her coffee. She set the cup down on the console. She
cracked her knuckles, which she always did before making a decision she
knew she'd regret.

Then she brought the Delilah Jane around to a new heading and punched
in the coordinates for Kepler-442b.

                               * * *

The first three days were easy. Empty space, clear channels, no traffic.
Rita ran dark, as always, and spent her time between course corrections
in the cargo bay, monitoring the eggs.

They were growing. The nutrient foam was depleting at a steady rate,
and the embryonic forms inside the translucent spheres were visibly
larger, their limbs more defined, their dark eyes — still closed —
more prominent. The chirping had settled into a regular cycle: active
during the first twelve hours of the ship's day, quiet during the
second twelve, as if the embryos had synchronized their development
to the rhythms of the Delilah Jane's lighting system.

On the fourth day, one of the eggs opened its eyes.

Rita was sitting on an overturned supply crate, eating a ration bar
and reading a technical manual on the Kepler-442b system — atmosphere,
gravity, surface conditions, what little was known about the indigenous
population — when she noticed that the nearest sphere had gone quiet.
She looked down and saw two large, dark, liquid eyes looking back at
her through the translucent membrane.

The eyes blinked. Once. Twice. Then the embryo chirped — a single,
clear note, directed at Rita with an unmistakable specificity.

"Hey there," Rita said.

The embryo chirped again. Its limbs — four of them, with delicate,
multi-jointed fingers — pressed against the inside of the sphere.

"Yeah," Rita said. "I know. Hang tight. We're working on it."

She was, she realized, talking to cargo. This was a new low, or
possibly a new high, depending on your perspective.

By the seventh day, all twelve had opened their eyes. They watched
Rita with an attentiveness that she found unnerving and oddly
flattering, tracking her movements through the cargo bay, chirping
when she arrived and falling silent when she left. She began to
recognize individual voices — the high warble, the low clicking
trill, the one that sounded like a rusty hinge and seemed to be the
most vocal of the group. She did not name them. Naming them would
make what she was about to do harder than it already was.

She named them anyway.

Warble. Click. Rusty. Pip. Echo. Whistle. Buzz. Hum. Chirp (she was
running out of creativity). Trill. Squeaky. And the quiet one, who
barely made a sound and watched her with eyes that seemed older than
the others, whom she called Old Soul.

"You are losing your mind, Vasquez," she told herself, and went back
to the cockpit to check the fuel gauge.

The fuel gauge was not encouraging. She was burning reserves faster
than projected — the chaff cloud she'd dumped at the jump point had
thrown off her mass calculations, and the Delilah Jane's drive was
running three percent less efficient than spec. At current consumption,
she'd reach Kepler-442b with a fuel margin of about two percent. Enough
to make orbit. Not enough to land and take off again.

Which meant she'd need to make a hot drop — aerobrake into the
atmosphere, locate a suitable release point, deploy the eggs, and
slingshot back to orbit on momentum alone, using her remaining fuel
for the course correction to get back to charted space.

It was not, by any reasonable standard, a safe plan.

Rita was not, by any reasonable standard, a safe person.

                               * * *

Kepler-442b filled the cockpit viewport on the eleventh day — a world
of deep greens and muddy browns under a rust-colored sky, wreathed in
clouds that moved in slow, heavy patterns suggesting a thick, humid
atmosphere. The red dwarf sun hung low on the horizon, casting long
shadows across a landscape of dense vegetation and winding waterways.

Rita brought the Delilah Jane in on a steep approach angle, hitting
the upper atmosphere hard and letting the friction do what her fuel
reserves couldn't. The ship shuddered and groaned, heat tiles glowing
cherry red on the external cameras, and Rita flew the way she always
flew — by instinct, by the seat of her pants, by the indefinable
calculus of a pilot who had spent twelve years threading needles at
high velocity and was still alive to be modest about it.

She leveled off at eight thousand meters and began her search pattern.

The First Encounters Protocol file on Kepler-442b was thin —
preliminary survey data from an unmanned probe, plus a brief report
from the single manned flyover that had confirmed the presence of an
indigenous population. The inhabitants were described as "small,
arboreal, highly social, with evidence of tool use and cooperative
construction." Their settlements were concentrated along the river
systems of the planet's southern temperate zone — exactly where Rita
was now flying.

She found them twenty minutes into the search. A cluster of structures
in the canopy of a dense forest, visible on the thermal scanner as a
pattern of heat signatures that could only be artificial — too regular,
too concentrated, too organized to be natural. A village. Maybe fifty
or sixty individuals, based on the thermal count.

Rita brought the Delilah Jane down to two thousand meters and opened
the cargo bay doors.

The wind howled through the bay. The eggs chirped frantically, a
chorus of alarm that cut through the engine noise. Rita worked fast,
disconnecting the thermal gel matrix from the crate's built-in
heating system and rigging a parachute from cargo netting and a
salvaged drag chute. She set the nutrient foam's autonomous heating
system to maintain temperature for forty-eight hours — enough time,
she hoped, for the eggs to be found by the right people.

She didn't know if the inhabitants would recognize the eggs. She didn't
know if the eggs had been taken from this particular settlement or from
another community on the other side of the planet. She didn't know if
the species even had a concept of rescue, or gratitude, or the return
of stolen children. She was operating on faith and instinct and the
stubborn conviction that bringing babies home was the right thing to do
regardless of the logistical complications.

She pushed the crate to the edge of the cargo bay. Below, the forest
canopy stretched in every direction, green and impenetrable. The thermal
signatures of the settlement glowed on her scanner like a campfire in
the dark.

"All right, kids," Rita said. "This is your stop."

She shoved the crate out into the air.

It fell, the drag chute deployed, and the crate descended in a slow,
spiraling arc toward the canopy. Rita watched on the aft camera until
the chute caught in the treetops and the crate swung to a stop,
suspended in the upper branches, fifty meters above the ground and
directly above the settlement.

The thermal scanner showed movement below. Small heat signatures,
converging on the position of the crate.

"Find your way home," Rita said.

She closed the cargo bay doors, hauled the Delilah Jane's nose up,
and punched what was left of the engines. The ship clawed for altitude,
shaking and protesting, and Rita watched the fuel gauge drop toward
zero with the calm fatalism of a woman who had made her choice and
was prepared to live with it.

She made orbit with 1.3 percent fuel remaining. Enough, barely, for
the slingshot maneuver that would send her back toward charted space,
where she could drift until a passing freighter picked up her distress
signal or she ran out of coffee, whichever came first.

                               * * *

The freighter Hunan Prospect found her three days later, drifting in
the outer reaches of the Tau Ceti shipping lane with her engines cold
and her emergency beacon blinking. The captain, a cheerful Malaysian
woman named Tan, charged her only for fuel and asked no questions,
which Rita appreciated.

She reached Ceres Station eight days after that. Fong was waiting
for her at the noodle shop, and his face told her that he already
knew.

"The lab on Callisto is unhappy," he said.

"The lab on Callisto can take a long walk out a short airlock," Rita
said. "You didn't tell me what was in the crate, Fong."

"You didn't ask. That was our arrangement."

"The arrangement's changed. No more bio runs. No live cargo. No eggs,
no embryos, no specimens. I'm a coyote, not a kidnapper."

Fong studied her for a long time. He was a small man with a face like
a clenched fist, and he was very, very good at calculating odds.

"You know they'll blacklist you," he said. "The Callisto people have
a long reach."

"They can reach all they want. I'll be in the wind."

Fong sighed. He placed a bowl of noodles in front of her — pork broth,
real scallions, an egg cracked into the steaming surface. It was, by
the standards of Ceres Station cuisine, an extraordinary gesture.

"You're a fool, Vasquez," he said.

Rita picked up her chopsticks.

"Yeah," she said. "But I'm a fool who can sleep at night."

She ate the noodles. They were good. Outside the shop's porthole, the
stars turned slowly in the black, and somewhere, forty-seven light-years
away, twelve voices chirped in a forest canopy, calling to the people
who were coming to bring them home.

================================================================================

                       YESTERDAY'S TOMORROW

                        by Phyllis Crenshaw

================================================================================

                               I.

The time capsule was not supposed to be there, which was, when you
thought about it, exactly the sort of thing you'd expect from a time
capsule. If it had been where it was supposed to be — wherever that
was, whenever that was — then it wouldn't have been very interesting.
The whole point of a time capsule, June Holloway decided, was that it
turned up at the wrong time.

This particular time capsule turned up at 3:47 on a Tuesday afternoon
in June 1954, in the backyard of a small Colonial Revival house on
Maple Street in Westfield, New Jersey, when June's gardening trowel
struck something metallic approximately eighteen inches below the
surface of what had been, until that moment, a perfectly ordinary
petunia bed.

June was thirty-two years old, the wife of Walter Holloway (assistant
vice president, Prudential Life Insurance, Newark office), and the
mother of two children, Bobby (nine) and Susan (six). She was a
practical woman with sensible shoes and auburn hair that she wore in
a French twist, and she was not in the habit of finding mysterious
objects buried in her garden. She was in the habit of planting
petunias, which she did every June — a coincidence of name and season
that she found privately amusing and that no one else had ever
remarked upon.

She knelt in the dirt and brushed the soil away from the object. It
was a cylinder, approximately twelve inches long and six inches in
diameter, made of a metal she did not recognize — lighter than steel,
smoother than aluminum, with a faint iridescence that caught the
afternoon light and scattered it into colors she could not quite name.
The surface was unmarked except for a single line of text etched along
its length in small, precise letters:

TO BE OPENED BY JUNE ELEANOR HOLLOWAY ON JUNE 17, 1954.

June stared at it. Today was June 17, 1954.

She looked around the backyard. Bobby was at a friend's house. Susan
was napping. The neighbor's cat, a fat orange tabby named Mr. Whiskers,
sat on the fence and regarded her with the magnificent indifference
that was his principal contribution to the neighborhood.

"Well," June said to the cat. "That's peculiar."

Mr. Whiskers did not disagree.

                               * * *

She took the cylinder inside and set it on the kitchen table. She
poured herself a glass of lemonade — she always kept a pitcher in the
icebox during the summer — and sat down to examine it.

The cylinder had no visible seam, no hinge, no lock, no mechanism of
any kind that she could identify. It was perfectly smooth, perfectly
sealed, and perfectly unhelpful. She tried twisting it. She tried
pulling on both ends. She tried pressing on various spots, on the
theory that it might have a hidden catch. Nothing worked.

She picked it up and looked at the inscription again. TO BE OPENED BY
JUNE ELEANOR HOLLOWAY ON JUNE 17, 1954. Not "to be opened on June
17, 1954." To be opened by June Eleanor Holloway on June 17, 1954.
Her full name. Her exact name, including the middle name that she never
used because she had always thought it sounded like it belonged to
someone's maiden aunt.

Someone had buried this cylinder in her backyard, addressed it to her
by name, and specified the exact date on which it was to be opened.
Someone who knew her name, knew where she lived, and knew — or at
least predicted — that she would be digging in the petunia bed on this
particular afternoon.

Which was, when you got right down to it, a little unsettling.

June set the cylinder down and took a long drink of lemonade. She was
a practical woman, and practical women did not panic over mysterious
cylinders. They assessed the situation, considered their options, and
proceeded in an orderly fashion.

She picked the cylinder up again and said, clearly and firmly, "Open."

The cylinder opened.

It split along a seam that had not existed a moment before, the two
halves separating with a soft hiss of air that carried a scent June
could not identify — something floral and electric, like ozone and
roses. Inside, cushioned in a material that looked like silk but felt
like nothing she had ever touched, was a single sheet of paper.

Not ordinary paper. It was white, perfectly white, with a texture that
was simultaneously smooth and substantial, and it showed no sign of age
— no yellowing, no brittleness, no foxing. It looked like it had been
manufactured that morning.

On the paper, in handwriting that was neat and feminine and entirely
unfamiliar, was a letter.

                               II.

The letter read:

    Dear Great-Great-Grandmother June,

    My name is Eleanora June Vasquez-Holloway, and I am writing to
    you from the year 2057. I am your great-great-granddaughter. I
    am seventeen years old. I am writing this letter because I need
    to apologize for something that our family has not done yet.

    I know this is confusing. It is confusing from my end, too. The
    technology that allows me to send this letter backward through
    time was developed in 2041 by a physicist named Dr. Aarav Chandra,
    and it works by exploiting a property of certain subatomic particles
    that I will not pretend to understand. What matters is that it
    works, that it is very expensive, and that I have spent my entire
    college savings to use it once.

    Here is what I need to tell you:

    In 1957 — three years from your present — a woman will come to
    your door asking for help. Her name is Lorraine Patterson. She
    will be frightened and she will be carrying a small child. She
    will ask you to let her stay for one night. She will say that she
    has nowhere else to go.

    In my family's history, you turn her away.

    I do not know why. No one in the family talks about it. The story
    has been passed down through four generations as a silence — a
    thing we all know about and no one discusses. What I know is this:
    Lorraine Patterson came to your door, you turned her away, and
    something terrible happened to her afterward. Something that could
    have been prevented.

    I am not writing to blame you. I think I understand why you might
    have turned her away. The reasons would have seemed sensible. They
    would have seemed practical. You are a practical woman — everyone
    in the family says so. Great-Grandmother Susan describes you as
    "the most level-headed woman who ever lived," which, coming from
    a woman who once talked a hijacker out of crashing a plane by
    explaining compound interest to him, is high praise.

    But practical is not always right. And sometimes the practical
    decision is the one that haunts a family for a hundred years.

    I am asking you, across a century, to open your door.

    I am asking you to let Lorraine Patterson in.

    I cannot tell you what happens if you do. The physics of temporal
    communication forbid me from describing future events in detail —
    not because of any law, but because the act of description
    changes the probability matrix and makes the described events
    less likely to occur. (Dr. Chandra calls this the "observer
    paradox of temporal communication," which is a fancy way of saying
    that if I tell you the future, it won't happen that way.)

    What I can tell you is this: the silence in our family — the
    thing we don't talk about — has shaped us. It has made us careful,
    guarded, reluctant to take risks on behalf of strangers. It has
    made us practical in a way that sometimes looks a lot like afraid.
    Great-Grandfather Bobby joined the State Department and spent his
    career making safe, cautious decisions. Grandmother Patricia
    married a safe, cautious man and lived a safe, cautious life. My
    mother, Dolores, is a safe, cautious accountant who has never
    once done anything that she could not explain on a balance sheet.

    They are good people. I love them. But they are haunted by a
    choice they didn't make and don't understand, and the haunting
    has made them smaller than they should have been.

    I am spending my college savings on this letter because I believe
    that if you open the door in 1957, everything changes. Not in a
    dramatic, movie way — the world doesn't end, no one cures cancer,
    the Dodgers still leave Brooklyn (I'm sorry; I know that one
    hurts). But our family changes. The silence goes away. And maybe
    — maybe — we become the kind of people who open doors.

    I cannot prove any of this. I cannot offer you evidence or
    guarantees. I can only offer you the word of a seventeen-year-old
    girl who loves her family and believes that it is not too late to
    fix a mistake that has not been made.

    Please, Grandmother June. Open the door.

    With love across a century,

    Eleanora June Vasquez-Holloway
    March 14, 2057

June read the letter three times. She set it down on the kitchen table
and stared at the wall for a while. Then she picked it up and read it
a fourth time.

                               * * *

The practical thing to do, of course, was to dismiss the letter as a
hoax.

June considered this option. She was, as the letter had correctly
noted, a practical woman, and practical women did not accept
extraordinary claims without extraordinary evidence. The letter
claimed to be from the future. The letter claimed to have been sent
backward through time using technology that would not be invented for
nearly ninety years. The letter claimed that June's great-great-
granddaughter — a person who did not yet exist, who was four
generations removed from the present, who had a hyphenated last name
that suggested social customs June could not anticipate — had spent
her college savings to deliver an apology for an event that had not
occurred.

The practical assessment: nonsense.

But the cylinder was not nonsense. The cylinder was sitting on her
kitchen table, made of a metal she could not identify, sealed with
a technology she could not explain, opened by a voice command that
should not have worked. The paper was not nonsense — it was a material
she had never seen, impossibly white, impossibly fresh, bearing an
inscription that included her full name and the exact date.

Someone had gone to extraordinary trouble to deliver this message.
Either it was an elaborate hoax executed with technology that did not
currently exist, or it was exactly what it claimed to be.

June was practical, but she was not closed-minded. She recognized
the difference between "this seems impossible" and "this is
impossible," and she recognized that the cylinder on her kitchen
table sat squarely in the gap between those two statements.

She read the letter a fifth time. She focused on the passage about
Lorraine Patterson. A woman would come to her door in 1957, asking
for help, carrying a small child. And June — the June of the letter's
history — would turn her away.

Why?

June did not know anyone named Lorraine Patterson. The name meant
nothing to her. But the letter's writer had anticipated June's
confusion and had not provided an explanation, which suggested that
the explanation did not matter — that whatever reasons June would have
for turning the woman away, they were reasons that seemed sufficient at
the time and insufficient in retrospect.

This struck June as uncomfortably plausible. She was, she admitted to
herself, a woman who valued order, predictability, and the maintenance
of social norms. She was a woman who kept a tidy house, a tidy garden,
and a tidy life. She was a woman who would, under certain
circumstances, turn away a stranger because the stranger represented
disorder, inconvenience, risk — because helping the stranger would
require stepping outside the careful boundaries of a life built on
caution and common sense.

She was, in short, exactly the kind of woman who would turn Lorraine
Patterson away and spend the rest of her life not talking about it.

This knowledge — not of the future, but of herself — was the most
unsettling thing about the letter.

                               III.

Walter came home at 5:35, as he always did. He hung his hat on the
rack by the door, kissed June on the cheek, and asked what was for
dinner. Pot roast, June said. He nodded and went to change out of
his suit.

June did not show him the letter. She did not show him the cylinder.
She had placed both in the back of her closet, behind the box of
Christmas ornaments and the suitcase they used for the annual trip
to the shore.

She did not show him because she could not imagine the conversation.
Walter was a good man — kind, reliable, steady as a metronome — but
his imagination did not extend to time-traveling letters from
descendants who had not yet been born. Walter's imagination extended
to life insurance actuarial tables and the prospects of the New York
Giants, and June loved him for precisely this quality, because it
made him predictable and prediction was a form of safety.

Over dinner, Bobby talked about his friend's new bicycle. Susan
spilled her milk. Walter discussed a problem at the office involving
a policyholder in Passaic who had filed a suspicious claim. June
nodded at the appropriate moments, asked the appropriate questions,
wiped up the appropriate milk, and thought about doors.

After the children were in bed, she sat in the living room with Walter
while he read the evening paper and she pretended to read a magazine.
The clock on the mantel ticked. The house was quiet. Through the window,
the maples on Maple Street — the symmetry had never struck her before —
stood in the warm June twilight, their leaves motionless in the still
air.

"Walter," she said.

"Hmm?" He did not look up from the paper.

"If someone came to our door asking for help — a stranger — what
would you do?"

Walter lowered the paper and looked at her over the tops of his reading
glasses. "What kind of help?"

"A place to stay. Just for a night. A woman with a child."

Walter considered this with the careful thoroughness he brought to all
questions. "I'd want to know the circumstances," he said. "Who she was,
where she'd come from, why she couldn't go to a hotel or a shelter."

"And if the circumstances were — unclear?"

"Then I'd probably call the police and let them sort it out. It's
not our responsibility to take in strangers, June. That's what social
services are for."

"Yes," June said. "I suppose you're right."

Walter returned to his paper. June returned to her magazine. The clock
ticked. The house was quiet.

June thought about a seventeen-year-old girl spending her college
savings to send a letter across a century, and she thought about a
family shaped by a silence, and she thought about the word "practical"
and how easily it could become another word for "afraid."

                               * * *

The next morning, after Walter had left for the office and the children
had gone to school, June retrieved the cylinder from her closet and
placed it on the kitchen table again. She reread the letter. Then she
opened the bottom drawer of the kitchen cabinet — the one where she
kept the household accounts, the recipe cards, and the good stationery
she used for thank-you notes — and took out a pen and a sheet of paper.

She wrote:

    Dear Eleanora,

    I received your letter. I do not understand how it reached me
    and I am not certain I believe everything it says. But I believe
    that you believe it, and I believe that the cylinder it arrived
    in was not made by anyone I know or any technology I know of, and
    I believe that you are my great-great-granddaughter, because the
    letter describes me with an accuracy that a stranger could not
    have achieved.

    I will remember Lorraine Patterson's name. When she comes to my
    door, I will let her in. I do not know what will happen after
    that. I do not know if it will change anything. But I will open
    the door.

    Your letter said that our family is haunted by a silence. I think
    you may be right, although the silence you describe has not
    happened yet, from where I sit. But I recognize the shape of it.
    I recognize the kind of woman who would create it, because I know
    that woman. I am that woman, or I could be.

    You asked me to be something other than practical. I will try. I
    cannot promise more than that, because I am who I am, and a
    single letter — even a letter from the future — does not remake a
    person overnight. But I will try to be braver than I might
    otherwise have been.

    I hope you get your college money back somehow. You seem like a
    girl who should go to college.

    With love across a century, sent the other direction,

    June Eleanor Holloway
    June 18, 1954

She folded the letter, placed it inside the cylinder, and closed the
lid. The seam sealed itself with a soft click, and the cylinder was
once again featureless and smooth.

June had no idea whether the letter would reach its destination. She
had no idea whether the cylinder functioned as a two-way delivery
system or whether it was a one-shot device, spent and inert. She had
no idea whether her reply would arrive in 2057 or whether it would
sit in the back of her closet until the house was demolished and the
cylinder was found by construction workers who would not know what it
was.

She did not know, and she decided that not knowing was acceptable.

She placed the cylinder back in the closet, behind the Christmas
ornaments. She went outside to the petunia bed, knelt in the warm
June dirt, and continued planting.

                               IV.

The years passed, as years do — steadily, without drama, marked by
the small accumulations that constitute a life. Bobby grew tall and
gangly and developed an interest in maps. Susan learned to ride a
bicycle and then to drive a car and then, to her mother's quiet pride,
to fly a plane. Walter received his promotion to full vice president
and bought June a new refrigerator to celebrate, which she accepted
with the grace of a woman who understood that love expressed itself
differently in different people.

June did not forget the letter. She could not have forgotten it if she
had tried. It sat in her closet, sealed in its impossible cylinder, a
piece of the future embedded in the present like a splinter — not
painful, exactly, but persistent, a constant low-grade awareness that
the world was stranger and larger than the view from Maple Street
suggested.

She thought about it on quiet afternoons, when the house was empty
and the light lay across the kitchen floor in the long, golden
parallelograms of late summer. She thought about Eleanora, the great-
great-granddaughter she would never meet, the girl who had spent her
college money on an act of faith. She thought about the family the
letter described — cautious, guarded, haunted by an unnamed deed —
and she thought about the family she wanted instead, and she wondered
whether wanting was enough to make a difference.

The name Lorraine Patterson was etched in her memory like the
inscription on the cylinder. She carried it with her the way she
carried her children's birthdays and her wedding anniversary and the
combination to the lock on Walter's filing cabinet — information too
important to forget, too significant to write down.

October 1957. Three years and four months after the petunia bed.

A Tuesday. Rain, the slow, cold rain of a New Jersey autumn that
turned the leaves to paste on the sidewalks and made the maples on
Maple Street look like women weeping. Walter was at work. Bobby was
at school. Susan was at a friend's house.

The doorbell rang at 2:15 in the afternoon.

June dried her hands on a dish towel and walked to the front door. She
opened it.

A woman stood on the porch. She was young — mid-twenties, maybe — with
dark hair plastered to her face by the rain and a cloth coat that was
soaked through. She was carrying a child — a boy, perhaps two years old,
bundled in a blanket that was dry, which meant that the woman had been
holding it under her coat, keeping the child warm at the expense of
herself.

The woman's eyes were wide and frightened and exhausted, and she held
the child with the fierce, desperate grip of someone who had been
holding on for a very long time and was not sure how much longer she
could manage.

"Please," the woman said. Her voice was hoarse. "My name is Lorraine
Patterson. I don't — I have nowhere — please. Just for one night."

June looked at the woman. She looked at the child. She looked at the
rain.

She thought about a letter in a closet. She thought about a girl in
2057. She thought about a century of silence.

She opened the door wide.

"Come in," June said. "You're soaked through. Let me get you a towel,
and I'll put the kettle on."

Lorraine Patterson stepped across the threshold, carrying her child
into the warmth of a house where a practical woman had decided, for
once in her life, to be something more.

                               * * *

June did not know what had happened to Lorraine Patterson in the other
version of events — the version where the door stayed closed. The
letter had not said, and June did not want to imagine it. What she
knew was what happened in this version: Lorraine stayed for a week,
not one night. She slept in Bobby's room (Bobby was moved to the
couch and complained about it with the righteous indignation of a
twelve-year-old whose territory had been invaded). The child — his
name was James — was quiet and solemn and attached himself to Susan
with a devotion that Susan, at nine, found alternately charming and
embarrassing.

June did not ask Lorraine where she had come from or what she was
running from. She did not need to ask. The bruises on Lorraine's wrists,
visible when her sleeves rode up while she helped with the dishes, told
a story that June could read without words.

Walter, to his considerable credit, asked no questions either. He came
home on the first evening, found a strange woman and child at his
dinner table, looked at June, and saw something in her expression that
told him everything he needed to know and nothing he needed to discuss.
He shook Lorraine's hand, said he was pleased to meet her, and asked
Bobby to pass the potatoes.

On the seventh day, June drove Lorraine to her sister's house in
Pennsylvania. She gave Lorraine fifty dollars from the household
savings — a significant sum, extracted from the envelope labeled
EMERGENCIES in the kitchen drawer — and the name of a lawyer in
Philadelphia whom Walter's colleague had recommended.

"Thank you," Lorraine said, standing beside the car, holding James on
her hip. Her eyes were still frightened, but less so. Her grip on the
child was still fierce, but steadier.

"You're welcome," June said. She did not say "anyone would have done
the same," because she knew that was not true. She did not say "it
was nothing," because it was not nothing. She said "you're welcome"
and meant it in the fullest sense of both words.

She drove home. She parked in the driveway. She sat in the car for a
moment, looking at the house — the neat Colonial Revival with its
white shutters and its petunia beds and its maple tree in the front
yard — and she felt, for the first time in her life, that the house
contained not just the present but the future, reaching backward to
meet her, full of people she would never know who would be shaped by
what she had done today.

She went inside. She made herself a glass of lemonade. She sat at the
kitchen table and thought about a girl named Eleanora, and she hoped —
not with the cautious, conditional hope of a practical woman, but with
the reckless, unreasonable hope of a woman who had opened a door and
changed a century — that somewhere, somewhen, in a future she would
never see, a family was laughing instead of silent, open instead of
closed, brave instead of afraid.

The clock ticked. The house was quiet. But it was a different quiet
now — not the silence of things unspoken, but the silence of a story
still being written, a page still turning, a door still open, waiting
to see who would walk through.

                         THE QUIET AFTER

                        by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                               I.

The bird was the size of a sparrow and the color of dust.

Dr. Mae Lin held it in both hands, cupped gently, the way you'd hold
water you didn't want to spill. It weighed almost nothing. Its body
was warm — one hundred and six degrees Fahrenheit, which was right,
which was exactly right, which was the temperature she had been
working toward for three years and seven months. Its heartbeat was
rapid and steady against her palms, a tiny percussion that she could
feel more than hear.

It had not yet made a sound.

Mae was standing in the aviary — a converted greenhouse at the
Kearney Research Station, fifteen miles outside of Lincoln, Nebraska,
where the Great Plains Biological Recovery Project had its
headquarters. The greenhouse was warm and humid and smelled of soil
and grain and the particular green scent of growing things that Mae
associated with hope, because hope was what this place was built on,
and hope was what it ran on, and hope was what kept her coming to
work each morning at five-thirty and staying until after dark, seven
days a week, for three years and seven months.

Outside the greenhouse, the Nebraska sky was the flat, pale blue of
early March, streaked with cirrus clouds that caught the first light
of the sun. The fields beyond the station were brown and bare — winter
wheat stubble, not yet plowed under — and the wind moved across them
with the steady, ceaseless pressure that was the defining feature of
life on the plains. It was the kind of sky that Mae had grown up under,
in a farmhouse forty miles south of here, and it was the kind of sky
that had once been full of birds.

Ten years ago. Ten years since the birds had stopped singing.

                               * * *

The weapon had been called Quietfall. That was the name the press had
given it, after it was over, when there was time for naming. The
military designation had been something clinical and alphanumeric —
BW-7734, or some similar abstraction — but the name that stuck was
the one the newspapers used, because it described the effect with the
awful precision that only a simple word can achieve.

It had been a biological agent. Engineered, targeted, released — by
whom, for what purpose, these questions had been debated and
investigated and argued about for a decade without resolution. What
was known: the agent was a modified retrovirus that targeted the
respiratory systems of avian species. It was airborne, highly
transmissible, and devastatingly lethal. It had been released —
simultaneously, it appeared, at multiple points around the globe —
in the spring of 2087, and within six months, it had killed every
bird on Earth.

Every bird. Every species, every population, every individual. From
the Arctic tern to the Emperor penguin, from the bald eagle to the
house sparrow, from the resplendent quetzal to the common pigeon.
The virus made no distinctions. It moved through the world's avian
population like fire through dry grass, jumping species barriers with
an ease that suggested deliberate engineering, spreading on the winds
that birds themselves had ridden for a hundred million years.

By autumn of 2087, the skies were empty.

Mae remembered the silence. Everyone remembered the silence. It was
the thing that people talked about when they talked about Quietfall,
the thing they couldn't describe but couldn't stop trying to describe.
Not the absence of birdsong — that was part of it, but it was more
than that. It was the absence of a layer of the world. The background
hum of feathers and calls and wingbeats that had been present in every
outdoor moment of every human life since the beginning of the species
was gone, and its absence created a void that nothing could fill.

People heard it in the morning, when the dawn chorus didn't come.
They heard it in the evening, when the roosting calls fell silent.
They heard it in the middle of the day, in parks and gardens and
forests, in the eerie stillness of places that should have been alive
with movement and sound. Children born after Quietfall didn't hear it
at all, because they had never known anything different, and this was
perhaps the worst thing — that a generation was growing up in a world
they believed was normal, a world without birds, a world where the sky
was a blank page and the trees were silent furniture.

Mae heard it every day. She heard it as a presence, not an absence —
the silence had a weight, a texture, a quality that pressed against
her eardrums like altitude. She had been a graduate student in
ornithology at the University of Nebraska when Quietfall happened,
two months from defending her dissertation on the nesting behavior of
the interior least tern, and she had watched her life's work become
a memorial in the space of a single season.

She did not leave the field. Some of her colleagues did — transferred
to entomology, botany, marine biology, disciplines that still had
living subjects. Mae stayed. She stayed because someone had to stay,
because the birds deserved someone who remembered them, and because
she believed — with a stubbornness that her mother, a farmer's
daughter herself, would have recognized and approved of — that the
silence was not permanent.

                               II.

The Great Plains Biological Recovery Project had been established in
2091, four years after Quietfall, funded by a consortium of
universities, government agencies, and private donors united by the
conviction that the extinction of the world's avian species was not
a fait accompli but a problem to be solved. The project's mission was
simple to state and staggeringly difficult to execute: bring the birds
back.

The raw material was genetic. In the years before Quietfall, ornithological
laboratories around the world had maintained tissue banks, frozen
gamete collections, and preserved DNA samples from thousands of avian
species. These collections had been assembled for research purposes —
phylogenetic studies, population genetics, conservation biology — and
no one had imagined that they would become the last remnants of entire
lineages. But that is what they were: the seeds from which the world's
bird populations would have to be regrown, if they were to be regrown
at all.

The technical challenges were immense. Preserved DNA was not a living
organism. It was a blueprint — detailed, complete, but inert. To
transform a genetic sequence into a living bird required a host egg,
a compatible cytoplasm, a developmental environment that could guide
the expression of thousands of genes in the correct sequence and at
the correct time. The techniques for doing this — cloning, synthetic
genomics, artificial gestation — existed in theory and had been
demonstrated in limited applications, but no one had ever attempted
to reconstruct an entire species from preserved genetic material.

Mae joined the project in 2093 and had worked on it ever since. Her
specific focus was the reconstruction of passerine species — the
songbirds, the perching birds, the group that had comprised more than
half of all bird species before Quietfall and that had been, in her
professional opinion, the hardest loss to bear. Not because passerines
were more ecologically important than other groups — the loss of
raptors, of seabirds, of pollinators had consequences that were still
cascading through ecosystems around the world — but because passerines
were the birds that lived closest to humans. They were the birds in
the backyard, the birds on the telephone wire, the birds whose songs
had been the background music of every human morning for ten thousand
years.

The project had achieved its first successes with larger species —
chickens, of all things, were the first birds to be successfully
reconstructed, which was anticlimactic but practically important — and
had gradually worked its way through progressively more difficult
reconstructions. Ducks, geese, pigeons, crows. Each success was a
triumph and a lesson, teaching the team what worked and what didn't,
what they understood about avian development and what they didn't.

Passerines were the hardest. Small bodies, fast metabolisms, complex
vocal learning systems, intricate social behaviors. The first dozen
attempts had failed at various stages — incomplete development,
respiratory failure, neurological abnormalities. Each failure was a
loss that Mae felt personally, because each failed embryo was a bird
that had almost existed, a song that had almost been sung.

The bird in her hands was attempt number forty-seven. The species was
Melospiza melodia — the song sparrow. Mae had chosen it for reasons
that were partly scientific and partly sentimental. The song sparrow
had been one of the most common and widespread passerines in North
America, found in every state, in every habitat from marsh to meadow
to suburban garden. Its song was one of the most studied vocalizations
in ornithology — a complex, melodious phrase that varied between
individuals and populations, learned by young birds from their fathers,
passed down through generations like a family story.

The song sparrow's song had been the first bird song Mae had learned
to identify, at age seven, standing in the alfalfa field behind her
parents' farmhouse while her mother pointed at a small brown bird on
a fence post and said, "Listen."

Forty-seven attempts. Three years and seven months. And now, cupped
in her hands, warm and alive and breathing, the bird that was either
the beginning of the world's recovery or another heartbreak in a long
series of heartbreaks.

It had not yet made a sound.

                               * * *

Mae carried the bird to the observation chamber — a small, climate-
controlled room at the rear of the aviary, equipped with acoustic
monitoring equipment, video cameras, and a one-way observation
window. She placed the bird on a perch — a section of natural
branch, with bark and lichens, the closest approximation to a wild
habitat that the lab could provide — and stepped back.

The bird sat on the perch. It looked around the chamber with quick,
alert movements of its head — left, right, up. Its eyes were bright
and dark and alive. It shifted its feet on the branch, gripping with
the strong toes that passerines used to lock themselves to perches,
and it ruffled its feathers — a quick, full-body shake that settled
the plumage into place with a precision that made Mae's breath catch,
because she had watched wild song sparrows do exactly that gesture
ten thousand times, and this bird — this bird that had never seen
another bird, that had been grown in a tank from preserved DNA, that
was the first of its kind in ten years — did it with the same casual
perfection.

Dr. James Okafor, the project's developmental biologist, appeared at
the observation window. He was a tall, deliberate man from Ibadan,
Nigeria, who had lost his own research — a decade-long study of the
village weaver's nest-building behavior — to Quietfall and had joined
the recovery project with the quiet intensity of a man who had decided
that grief was best expressed as work.

"Vitals?" he asked through the intercom.

"Heart rate steady. Respiration normal. Feather condition excellent.
Muscle tone — " Mae watched the bird shift on its perch. "Good.
Better than the last three. Much better."

"Neural assessment?"

"Motor coordination appears normal. Spatial orientation normal. It's
alert, it's responsive, it's moving correctly." She paused. "It
hasn't vocalized."

"It's been alive for six hours, Mae."

"Wild song sparrows vocalize within minutes of fledging. Begging
calls. Alarm calls. Contact calls."

"Wild song sparrows have parents. This bird has a perch and a
monitoring system. Give it time."

Mae nodded. Okafor was right. Patience was part of the work.
Patience was most of the work.

She sat down in the observation chair and watched.

                               III.

The bird did not sing on the first day. It explored the chamber,
hopping from perch to perch, examining the branch, the walls, the
food and water dishes that Mae had placed at intervals around the
space. It ate — seeds, mealworms, the supplemental nutrition paste
that the team had developed — with an appetite that suggested healthy
metabolic function. It drank. It preened. It did everything a song
sparrow should do, with one exception.

It was silent.

On the second day, Mae played recordings.

This was part of the protocol — a carefully designed acoustic
enrichment program developed by the team's behavioral specialists.
Song sparrows were vocal learners; they acquired their songs by
listening to adult males during a critical period of development.
Without a live tutor, the best available substitute was a library of
recorded songs, captured in the field before Quietfall by
researchers who had not known they were making the last recordings of
a living tradition.

Mae selected a recording from the project's archive: a male song
sparrow recorded in 1985 at the Konza Prairie Biological Station, in
the Flint Hills of Kansas, sixty miles from where Mae had grown up.
She had chosen this particular recording because the bird's dialect —
the specific arrangement of notes and phrases that characterized the
songs of a local population — was the dialect she remembered from her
childhood. It was not a scientific decision. It was a personal one.
She wanted the first new song sparrow in a decade to sing the song
she had grown up hearing.

She pressed play. The recording filled the observation chamber — a
bright, tumbling sequence of notes, three or four introductory whistles
followed by a complex trill that descended in pitch and ended with a
buzzy flourish. The song lasted approximately 2.3 seconds. Mae played
it on a loop, one repetition every thirty seconds, with silence between.

The bird listened.

Mae could see it listening — the way its head cocked to one side, the
way its body stilled, the way its eyes fixed on a point in space as
though the sound were visible. It listened with the total concentration
that Mae had seen in wild birds during the critical learning period,
when a young male's brain was literally being rewired by the songs it
heard, neural pathways forming and strengthening with each repetition.

It listened all day. Mae played the recording for eight hours, with
breaks, and the bird listened to every repetition. It did not sing. It
did not attempt to sing. It sat on its perch and listened, and Mae
sat in her chair and watched, and the recorded song of a bird that
had been dead for more than a century played over and over in a small
room in Nebraska while the silent sky stretched overhead.

On the third day, the bird began to practice.

The sounds it made were not yet a song. They were what ornithologists
called subsong — a quiet, formless babbling, barely audible, that
young song sparrows produced during the early stages of vocal learning.
It was the avian equivalent of a baby's babbling: motor practice,
neural calibration, the raw material from which a structured
vocalization would eventually be shaped.

Mae heard the first subsong sounds at 6:47 AM, through the observation
chamber's microphones. She was sitting in the pre-dawn dark with a cup
of coffee, as she had been sitting every morning for three days, and
the sound was so faint and so unexpected that she thought at first she
had imagined it.

She had not imagined it.

The bird was on its perch, its bill slightly open, producing a stream
of soft, warbling notes that had no structure, no rhythm, no
recognizable pattern. It was noise. It was beautiful noise. It was
the sound of a small brain working very hard to learn something that
its species had been learning for millions of years, and Mae pressed
her hand over her mouth and listened and did not move, because she did
not want to do anything that might interrupt the process.

She called Okafor on the internal line. "James."

"What is it?"

"It's singing."

"It's — " She heard him stand up, heard his chair push back. "I'm
coming."

He arrived at the observation window two minutes later, still holding
his coffee, his face a study in controlled scientific excitement. He
listened. The subsong continued — a quiet, meandering stream of sound
that filled the observation chamber like water filling a basin, slowly,
steadily, finding its level.

"Mae," Okafor said. "That's subsong."

"I know."

"That's vocal learning. Active, spontaneous vocal learning."

"I know."

"The neural pathways are functional. The syringeal muscles are
functional. The auditory feedback loop is functional. Mae, this bird
is learning to sing."

"I know, James."

They stood together at the window and listened. Outside, the Nebraska
sky lightened from black to gray to pale, cold blue, and no bird
greeted the dawn except the small brown bird in the observation chamber,
practicing sounds that no living song sparrow had made in ten years.

                               IV.

The subsong phase lasted nine days.

During that time, the bird's vocalizations gradually became more
structured, more organized, more recognizably related to the recorded
song it was learning. The formless babbling resolved into fragments —
a whistle here, a trill there, a buzz that approximated the
characteristic flourish at the end of the recorded song. Mae tracked
the development with the acoustic analysis software, watching the
spectrograms evolve from chaos to pattern, from noise to music.

On the fifth day, the bird produced a recognizable introductory
whistle — three ascending notes, slightly off-pitch, but structurally
correct.

On the seventh day, it attempted the trill — a rapid sequence of
frequency-modulated notes that descended in pitch, rough and
imprecise but unambiguously a trill.

On the ninth day, at 5:23 in the morning, Mae was in the observation
chair with her coffee, watching the spectrogram on the monitor, when
the bird sang.

Not subsong. Not practice. Not fragments.

A song.

It began with three introductory whistles — clear, pure, ascending,
each one hitting its target frequency within two percent of the
recorded model. Then the trill — a cascade of modulated notes,
tumbling downward like water over stones, precisely timed, precisely
pitched, precisely controlled. Then the terminal buzz — a complex,
vibrato-rich flourish that lasted 0.4 seconds and ended cleanly, with
a sharpness that suggested confidence.

The whole song lasted 2.1 seconds. It was not identical to the
recorded model — it was slightly shorter, slightly higher in pitch,
with a terminal buzz that had a quality the recorded bird's lacked, a
brightness that was this bird's own, not copied, not learned, but
invented. It was the song of a Kansas song sparrow, learned from a
recording of a bird that had been dead for over a century, sung by a
bird that was the first of its kind in a decade, in a greenhouse in
Nebraska, at dawn, to an audience of one.

Mae did not move. She did not breathe. She sat in her chair and
listened as the bird sang again.

And again.

And again.

It sang with the urgency and joy of a creature discovering that it
possessed a capability it had not known it had — that the sounds it
had been practicing, the neural pathways it had been building, the
muscular coordinations it had been refining, all converged in this
single, exquisite act: the production of a song. Its song. A song
that belonged to a tradition stretching back millions of years, a
tradition that had been broken by human violence and was now, in this
small room, in this small body, being resumed.

Mae's hands were shaking. Her coffee had gone cold. She was crying,
and she did not wipe the tears away, because wiping tears required
moving and moving might disturb the bird, and the bird was singing,
the bird was singing, the bird was singing.

Okafor appeared at the window. He had heard it through the intercom.
His face was wet. He said nothing. He stood beside Mae and listened.

The bird sang for forty-three minutes. It sang the same song, over
and over, with small variations in tempo and phrasing and terminal
ornamentation that were the hallmark of a healthy vocal learner
exploring the boundaries of its repertoire. Each repetition was
slightly different from the last. Each repetition was the song of a
species remembering itself.

At 6:06 AM, Mae turned on the external speakers.

The song — small, bright, impossibly alive — spilled out of the
greenhouse and into the Nebraska morning. It crossed the gravel
parking lot and the equipment yard and the brown winter fields. It
traveled on the cold March air, carried by the same wind that had
once carried the songs of millions, and it reached the ears of a
technician walking from the dormitory to the lab, and a maintenance
worker starting a truck, and a security guard at the front gate,
and each of them stopped what they were doing and stood still and
listened.

Because they recognized it. Not the specific song, not the specific
species, but the category. The fundamental category. The sound that
had been missing from the world for ten years, the sound that their
brains were wired to detect and respond to, the sound that meant
morning, that meant alive, that meant the world was working the way
it was supposed to work.

Birdsong.

The technician sat down on the steps of the dormitory and put her
face in her hands. The maintenance worker turned off his truck engine
so he could hear better. The security guard called his wife.

Inside the greenhouse, Mae pressed her palm flat against the
observation window and watched the small brown bird on its perch,
singing the song of a species that had been dead and was now, in
this one small body, in this one small voice, alive again.

                               V.

That evening, Mae drove home to the farmhouse where she had grown up.
Her parents were gone — her father to cancer in 2089, her mother to
pneumonia the following winter — but the house was still there, and
Mae kept it, driving out on weekends to mow the yard and check the
pipes and sit on the porch in the evenings, because the house was
where she had learned to listen.

She sat on the porch. The fields were dark around her, flat and open
to the sky, and the silence was the same silence that had covered the
world for ten years — heavy, complete, unbroken by any feathered voice.

But it was different now.

Not because the silence had been filled. One bird in a greenhouse in
Nebraska did not fill ten years of silence. One song did not replace
a hundred million years of songs. The world was still quiet, the skies
were still empty, and the cascading ecological consequences of
Quietfall were still unfolding — crop failures from the loss of avian
pollinators and seed dispersers, insect population explosions,
disruptions to nutrient cycles and food webs that would take decades
to understand, let alone repair.

One bird did not fix any of that.

But one bird was a beginning. One bird was proof that the work could
be done, that the technology functioned, that a living song could be
grown from preserved DNA and a recorded model and three years and
seven months of patience. One bird meant that the next bird was
possible, and the bird after that, and the bird after that, until the
greenhouse held dozens, then hundreds, then thousands, until the
reconstructed populations were large enough and healthy enough to be
released into the wild, to breed, to spread, to fill the empty niches
and the empty skies and the empty mornings.

It would take decades. Mae knew that. She was forty-one years old, and
she would probably not live to see the world restored — if it could be
restored at all, if the ecological damage was not already too deep,
if the engineered virus did not return, if the funding held, if the
political will endured. There were so many ifs. There were always so
many ifs. The whole endeavor was an act of faith — faith that the
work mattered, faith that the future was worth building, faith that
a small brown bird singing in a greenhouse was not a footnote but a
first chapter.

Mae sat on the porch and listened to the silence. She had been
listening to it for ten years, and she would listen to it for many
more, and she would work against it every day, because that was what
you did. You heard the silence, and you refused to accept it, and you
went to work, and you tried.

The wind moved across the fields. The stars turned overhead. Somewhere,
fifteen miles north, in a greenhouse in Nebraska, a small brown bird
slept on its perch, its feathers fluffed against the chill, its
heartbeat steady, its song already encoded in the neural pathways of
its brain, ready to be sung again at dawn.

Mae closed her eyes and listened to the night. It was quiet. It had
been quiet for a long time.

But not forever. Not anymore.

The aliens who captured Jack "Ace" McKenna did him the courtesy of
letting him keep his boots.

Everything else — his flight suit, his sidearm, his emergency
transponder, the lucky poker chip he carried in his breast pocket, and
the photograph of Betty Callahan that he kept tucked behind the poker
chip — they took. They stripped him down to his undershirt and trousers
in a holding cell that smelled like copper and machine oil, and they
left him standing barefoot on a metal floor that was cold enough to
make his teeth ache, and then an alien that looked like a seven-foot
praying mantis in chrome armor walked in and dropped his boots on the
floor.

"Put those on," the alien said, in English that was too perfect, the
kind of English that a machine produces when it translates word by
word without understanding idiom or emphasis.

"Much obliged," Ace said, because his mother had raised him to be
polite even when the circumstances didn't call for it. He pulled on
the boots. They were standard Terran Space Corps issue, scuffed
brown leather with magnetic soles, and they were the most comfortable
thing he owned. Whatever was coming, he'd face it on his feet.

"What happens now?" he asked.

"Now," said the mantis, "you fight."

                               * * *

Here is what had happened:

Ace McKenna was a pilot — Lieutenant, Terran Space Corps, assigned to
the patrol cruiser Achilles on a routine survey mission along the
outer boundary of mapped space. He was twenty-nine years old, six feet
tall, with sandy hair, a crooked nose that had been broken twice (once
in a bar fight on Ganymede, once in a landing that the official report
described as "controlled" and that Ace described as "a real bad day"),
and a grin that his commanding officer, Captain Hollister, had once
called "a clear and present danger to military discipline."

He was a good pilot. Better than good. He had reflexes like a cat
and an intuition for orbital mechanics that his instructors at the
Academy had called "either brilliant or suicidal, and probably both."
He flew the way some men played jazz — by feel, by instinct, by an
internal rhythm that couldn't be taught and couldn't be faked.

He was also, at the moment, in a considerable amount of trouble.

The Achilles had been surveying a system in the Sculptor Dwarf Galaxy
— a red dwarf with three rocky planets and a gas giant, unremarkable
in every respect — when the ship had been seized by a tractor beam of
a power and sophistication that the Terran Space Corps had never
encountered. The beam had dragged the Achilles into the cargo bay of
a vessel so large that Ace, looking out the cockpit viewport, had
mistaken it for a small moon.

The crew — fourteen men and women — had been separated. Ace had seen
Captain Hollister and Navigator Chen and the others led away down
corridors that branched like the passages of an anthill, and then he
had been brought to the holding cell, and the mantis had given him
back his boots, and now here he was.

"Fight?" Ace said. "Fight who? Fight what?"

The mantis tilted its head at an angle that, in a human, would have
suggested amusement. Its compound eyes reflected Ace's face in a
hundred tiny copies.

"Others," the mantis said. "You are a warrior. We have identified your
vessel as a military craft and your rank as a combat designation. Our
empire settles disputes through personal combat. You have entered our
territory. This is a dispute. Therefore, you fight."

"And if I win?"

"You and your crew are released."

"And if I lose?"

"Then you are dead, and the question is no longer relevant."

Ace considered this. He was, by nature and training, a man who assessed
situations quickly and made decisions faster. The situation was bad.
The decision was simple.

"All right," he said. "When do we start?"

"Now," said the mantis, and a door opened behind Ace that had not
been there a moment ago, and beyond it was light — bright, hot, white
light — and noise — a roar, a sustained, rhythmic roar that Ace
recognized immediately because it was the same sound in every culture,
on every world, in every species that gathered to watch other beings
fight.

A crowd. Cheering.

Ace squared his shoulders, adjusted his boots, and walked through the
door.

                               II.

The arena was immense.

Ace stepped out onto a platform of polished black stone that jutted
from the wall of a circular enclosure at least three hundred yards
across. The walls rose sheer on all sides, smooth and featureless, to
a height of perhaps a hundred feet, and above the walls — tiers.
Thousands of tiers, packed with aliens of a dozen species, their bodies
a riot of color and shape and size, their voices merging into that
single, sustained, unbroken roar. The sky above the arena — if it was
a sky and not a projection — was dark and starless, and the light came
from somewhere Ace couldn't identify, bright and diffuse and slightly
too warm.

On the floor of the arena, fifty feet below Ace's platform, a surface
of raked sand stretched to the opposite wall. The sand was gray and
fine, and it bore the marks of recent activity: footprints, drag marks,
and, in several places, stains that were dark enough to be blood and
probably were.

A second platform jutted from the opposite wall, and on it stood a
creature.

It was big. Ace was not a small man, but this thing had a foot of
height on him and probably eighty pounds. It was bipedal, roughly
humanoid, with a heavy, muscular frame covered in plates of what
looked like natural armor — thick, overlapping scales the color of
tarnished bronze. Its arms were long and ended in hands with four
fingers, each tipped with a curved claw the length of a hunting knife.
Its face was flat, broad, and dominated by a wide mouth lined with
teeth that were clearly not designed for a vegetarian diet.

It was holding a weapon — a short, thick blade that looked like a
cross between a machete and a meat cleaver.

Ace looked down at his own hands. Empty. He looked around the
platform. Nothing. No weapons, no tools, no advantages of any kind.
Just a man in an undershirt and boots standing on a rock fifty feet
above a sand pit, facing a creature that outweighed him by a
significant margin and was armed.

"Well," Ace said to no one in particular. "This is going to be
interesting."

A chime sounded — a deep, resonant tone that silenced the crowd for
exactly two seconds. Then the mantis's voice, amplified to fill the
arena, spoke in a language Ace didn't understand. The crowd roared
again. The platforms began to descend.

They lowered smoothly, without vibration, sinking into the arena
floor until Ace was standing on the sand. The creature on the opposite
platform — his opponent, his enemy, the thing that was going to try
to kill him in the next few minutes — was now sixty yards away and
closing. It had stepped off its platform and was walking toward the
center of the arena with the casual confidence of a being that had
done this before and expected to do it again.

Ace walked toward the center, too. Not because he was confident —
he was terrified, in a focused, clear-headed way that he recognized
as the same terror he felt in combat flying, the kind that sharpened
everything and slowed nothing — but because walking away was not an
option. Behind him was a wall. Above him was a crowd. Ahead of him
was the fight.

He had to find a weapon. He had to find one fast.

His eyes scanned the arena floor as he walked. Sand. More sand.
Near the wall to his left, a tumble of broken stone — debris from
some previous bout, perhaps, or deliberate environmental furniture
placed for the entertainment of the crowd. And — there.

Half-buried in the sand, near the base of the wall, a glint of metal.

Ace altered his course, moving at an angle that he hoped looked casual,
keeping his eyes on his opponent while his peripheral vision tracked
the metallic gleam. The creature was thirty yards away now, and it had
noticed his change of direction. Its flat face showed no expression
that Ace could read, but it adjusted its own course to cut him off.

It was smart. That was going to be a problem.

Ace broke into a run.

He was fast — always had been, even as a kid in Kansas City, racing
other boys through the rail yards and the empty lots, and the Academy
had refined that speed into something tactical. He covered the
distance to the wall in four seconds, dropped to his knees, and
grabbed.

His fingers closed around a sidearm. A pulse pistol — standard Terran
issue, the same model he'd worn on his hip for three years. Someone
else's sidearm, taken from some other prisoner, discarded in the
sand of this alien arena like a piece of trash.

He pulled it free and checked it in a single practiced motion. The
power cell indicator was dark. No charge. The casing was cracked along
the barrel — a structural failure that meant the weapon couldn't hold
a full charge even if he had a power cell. It was, by any reasonable
assessment, broken.

But it was still a tool. It was still metal. It was still something.

The creature was ten yards away and moving fast.

Ace rolled to his feet, flipped the pistol in his hand so he was
holding it by the barrel — the cracked casing gave it a jagged edge
that was almost sharp enough to cut — and set his feet in the sand.

"Okay, big fella," he said. "Let's dance."

                               * * *

The creature was fast for its size, and it was strong, and it knew
how to use the blade. It came at Ace with a sweeping horizontal cut
that would have taken his head off if he hadn't ducked, and the
backswing nearly caught his shoulder as he rolled to the side. The
crowd roared. Ace scrambled backward, keeping distance, watching the
creature's footwork.

Footwork told you everything. A fighter who moved his feet well was
a fighter who had been trained. A fighter who moved them badly was
strong but beatable. This creature moved well — balanced, centered,
each step deliberate, each shift of weight purposeful. It had been
trained. It had done this before. It was a professional.

Ace was not a professional fighter. He was a professional pilot. But
pilots in the Terran Space Corps received hand-to-hand combat
training — twelve weeks of it, with an instructor named Sergeant
Torres who had lost an arm in the Outer Worlds campaign and made up
for it with a ferocity that bordered on the personal — and Ace had
paid attention, because paying attention was a survival skill and
Ace McKenna intended to survive.

The creature attacked again — a lunging thrust aimed at Ace's
midsection. Ace sidestepped, caught the creature's blade arm at the
wrist, and drove the broken pistol's jagged edge across the back of
its hand. The scales held — they were tough, like rhinoceros hide —
but the creature felt it. It grunted and pulled back, and for a
moment Ace had an opening.

He didn't take it. Not yet. He wasn't ready. He needed to understand
the creature's patterns, its habits, its weaknesses. Every fighter
had a tell — a habit, a preference, a gap in their defense that they
returned to under pressure. Ace needed to find this creature's tell
before the creature found his.

They circled. The crowd noise rose and fell with the rhythm of the
combat, surging when they closed and subsiding when they separated.
The sand was churned where they'd fought, and Ace's bootprints traced
a pattern of evasion and counter-movement that would have told a
trained observer exactly how the fight was going: the human was
faster, the alien was stronger, and neither had found the advantage.

The creature attacked a third time — another sweeping cut, followed
by a short jab with the pommel of the blade. The jab was new. It was
a combination, a one-two, and it told Ace something: the creature was
adapting. It had tried the same attack twice and Ace had evaded it, so
it had added a follow-up. It was learning.

Ace needed to learn faster.

He backed away, circling toward the pile of broken stone he'd noticed
earlier. The stones were chunks of some alien material — dense, heavy,
roughly the size of bricks. Not weapons, exactly. Tools. Options.

He feinted left, drawing the creature's blade in that direction, then
darted right, scooped a stone from the pile, and threw it.

Not at the creature's body. At its feet.

The stone hit the sand directly in front of the creature's right foot
just as it was shifting its weight forward for another attack. The
creature's foot came down on the stone, the stone rolled, and for one
second — maybe less — the creature was off-balance.

Ace closed the distance in two steps. He drove the broken pistol's
jagged edge into the gap between two armor plates on the creature's
left side, just below the arm — the one spot where the natural armor
was thinnest, where the plates separated to allow the arm to move. He
felt the edge catch, felt resistance, felt it give. The creature
bellowed — a deep, grating roar that vibrated in Ace's chest — and
swung its blade in a wild arc that caught Ace across the ribs and sent
him spinning into the sand.

Pain. Bright, hot, immediate. Ace rolled and came up gasping, his
left side burning, blood soaking through his undershirt in a spreading
stain. The cut was shallow — the creature's swing had been wild,
panicked, lacking the precision of its earlier attacks — but it hurt,
and it was bleeding, and the creature was already turning to press its
advantage.

But the creature was hurt too. The makeshift weapon had found its
mark, and the gap between the armor plates showed a dark stain of its
own blood — thicker than human blood, almost black. The creature's
left arm was hanging slightly lower than before, and its movement was
slower, stiffer. The wound was affecting it.

Ace grinned. He couldn't help it. The situation was absurd — a man
with a broken pistol and a bleeding side, facing an armored alien in
a gladiatorial arena in front of ten thousand screaming spectators —
and the absurdity of it tripped a wire in his brain that connected
fear directly to amusement, which was either a survival mechanism or
a personality disorder, and at this particular moment, Ace didn't care
which.

"Round two," he said, and threw another stone.

                               III.

The fight lasted eleven minutes. In that time, Ace hit the creature
with six stones, three strikes with the broken pistol, and one
full-body tackle that took them both to the sand in a tangle of limbs
and fury that the crowd seemed to enjoy enormously. The creature hit
Ace with two blade strikes (one deep cut on the left forearm, one
shallow slash across the back), a headbutt that rattled his vision for
three critical seconds, and a kick that cracked at least one rib and
sent him tumbling fifteen feet across the arena floor.

By the ninth minute, both combatants were bleeding, exhausted, and
operating on the pure, animal stubbornness that was the last fuel in
the tank when everything else was spent. The creature's left arm was
nearly useless. Ace's left hand was numb, and he was breathing in
short, shallow gasps that told him the cracked rib was worse than he'd
thought.

The creature charged. It was slower now, its footwork degraded by
fatigue and injury, and Ace saw the tell he'd been looking for — a
slight hitch in the creature's right knee, a microsecond delay at the
top of each stride where the leg locked before driving forward. An
injury, or a structural weakness. Something that, under pressure, in
exhaustion, became a vulnerability.

Ace waited. The creature was five yards away, four, three — blade
raised for a downward strike that would end the fight if it landed.
Ace could see the muscles in the creature's arm tensing, could see
the arc of the swing beginning, could see the whole geometry of the
attack unfolding like a diagram.

He dropped.

Not to the side. Down. Flat to the sand, below the arc of the blade,
which whistled over his head close enough to part his hair. And from
the ground, with everything he had left, he drove the broken pistol
upward into the creature's right knee — the hitch, the weakness, the
tell — and felt the joint give way with a wet, crunching sound that
was the ugliest and most beautiful thing he had ever heard.

The creature went down.

It fell forward, its blade arm trapped beneath its own body, its right
leg folding at an angle that legs were not supposed to fold, and Ace
rolled clear and came up standing and pressed the jagged edge of the
broken pistol against the creature's throat.

The arena went silent.

Ace stood over his opponent, breathing hard, bleeding from four
wounds, his vision swimming at the edges, his cracked rib screaming
with every breath. The creature looked up at him with eyes that were
not human but were, in that moment, entirely comprehensible. They
were the eyes of a being that knew it had lost and was waiting to
see what that meant.

"I'm not going to kill you," Ace said. He didn't know if the creature
understood English. He didn't know if it mattered. "Fight's over. I
won. That's enough."

The mantis's voice filled the arena: a single word in the alien
language, repeated three times. The crowd erupted — not in anger, not
in disappointment, but in something that sounded, against all
probability, like approval.

Ace dropped the broken pistol in the sand and sat down.

                               IV.

The mantis came to him in the medical bay — a room of gleaming
surfaces and instruments that hummed and clicked and did things to
his wounds that human medicine couldn't match. The cut on his forearm
closed and sealed in thirty seconds. The cracked rib knitted itself
together with a warmth that was almost pleasant. The slash across his
back stopped hurting before the alien medic had finished examining it.

"You fought well," the mantis said. It stood in the doorway, its
chrome armor reflecting the medical bay's sterile light.

"I fought ugly," Ace corrected. "But I fought alive, which is the
only kind of fighting I know."

"You spared your opponent."

"He was beat. No reason to kill a man who's already down. Even if he
isn't technically a man."

The mantis tilted its head — that same angle of what Ace was beginning
to interpret as genuine amusement. "In our culture, mercy in the
arena is considered a display of superior strength. The crowd was
impressed."

"Yeah, well, I wasn't thinking about the crowd. I was thinking about
the fact that the poor bastard hadn't done anything to me and didn't
deserve to die just because some empire decided fights are a good way
to settle parking disputes."

"It is not a parking dispute. It is a territorial incursion."

"Same thing, bigger scale."

The mantis was quiet for a moment. Ace was beginning to understand
that these silences were meaningful — that the mantis was not simply
pausing but processing, considering, deciding.

"Your crew will be released," the mantis said. "Your vessel will be
repaired and returned. You will be escorted to the boundary of our
territory."

"And then?"

"And then we will see. You have earned recognition. In our empire,
warriors who earn recognition are remembered. You may find that this
memory serves you in future encounters with our people."

"I'd prefer not to have future encounters with your people, no
offense."

"Offense is a concept that does not translate. But I understand your
meaning." The mantis turned to leave, then paused. "The weapon you
used. The broken device."

"My sidearm. What was left of it."

"It was not a weapon. It was a tool, damaged beyond its original
function, repurposed through ingenuity and desperation. In our
culture, this is considered the highest form of combat — to create
advantage from nothing, to make the broken thing useful."

"Where I come from," Ace said, "we call that Tuesday."

The mantis made a sound that Ace's translator couldn't process —
a rapid clicking that might have been laughter.

"Your species," it said, "is going to be interesting."

                               * * *

They gave him back his flight suit, his transponder, his lucky poker
chip, and the photograph of Betty Callahan. They did not give him back
his sidearm — the broken one, the one he'd used in the arena — and
Ace didn't ask for it. It was just a broken pistol. It had done its
job.

He found the Achilles in a docking bay the size of a football field,
its hull patched and polished, its systems running cleaner than they
had since the ship had left drydock. The crew was aboard — shaken,
bewildered, but unharmed. Captain Hollister clapped Ace on the shoulder
and asked what the hell had happened, and Ace told her, and she said
several things that regulations did not permit her to say and that
Ace appreciated enormously.

They cleared the alien vessel and made the jump to charted space, and
Ace sat in the pilot's chair and watched the stars blur into the
familiar tunnel of faster-than-light transit, and he thought about a
creature with bronze scales lying on the sand of an alien arena,
looking up at him with eyes that expected death and found mercy instead.

He pulled the photograph of Betty Callahan from behind the poker chip
and looked at it. She was smiling, the way she always smiled in
photographs — a little crooked, a little mischievous, like she knew
something you didn't.

"You're not going to believe this one, Betty," he said.

But he knew she would. Betty believed everything he told her, not
because she was gullible, but because she knew him well enough to
know that the truth, in Ace McKenna's case, was always stranger than
anything he could have invented.

The stars blurred. The ship flew. Ace McKenna went home.

                        THE INHERITANCE

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The old man died on a Tuesday in September, and his lawyer called the
heirs on Wednesday.

There were three of them. Martin was the eldest, fifty-four, an
engineer in Cleveland who built bridges and spoke carefully and did
not like surprises. Sandra was the middle child, forty-nine, a
professor of economics at the University of Michigan who liked
surprises even less than Martin did. Thomas was the youngest, forty-
two, an unemployed something-or-other in San Francisco who liked
surprises just fine, as long as they involved money.

The old man was their father, Elliot Grey, and he had been, at the
time of his death, the third-wealthiest individual in the United
States.

The lawyer's name was Petersen. He met them in his office in Manhattan
— a room of dark wood and leather that smelled like old paper and
important decisions. He was a small man with a careful manner and the
unreadable expression of someone who had spent forty years delivering
news that people did not expect.

"Your father's will is unusual," Petersen said.

"Everything about our father was unusual," Sandra said. "Get to the
point."

Petersen opened a folder. "Mr. Grey's estate is valued at approximately
fourteen billion dollars. Under the terms of the will, the entire
estate is held in trust, pending the completion of a single condition."

"What condition?" Martin asked.

"You are required, all three of you, to travel to a location specified
in the will and fulfill an obligation described therein. If you
complete the obligation, the estate is divided equally among you. If
any one of you refuses to go, or fails to complete the obligation,
the entire estate is forfeit to charity."

"What location?" Thomas asked. He was already calculating his share.
Thomas was always calculating.

Petersen turned a page. "The will specifies a set of coordinates. They
are not on Earth."

The room was quiet.

"Not on Earth," Martin repeated.

"The coordinates correspond to a location in the Alpha Centauri system.
Specifically, the second planet of Proxima Centauri."

"That's impossible," Sandra said. "Proxima Centauri is four light-years
away. There is no human settlement there. There is no way to reach it."

"Your father anticipated that objection," Petersen said. He opened
a second folder. "He has provided transportation."

                               * * *

The ship was in a private hangar at a facility in the Nevada desert
that none of the siblings had known existed. Elliot Grey had owned the
facility through a chain of shell companies so complex that even Sandra,
who understood financial structures the way most people understood
breakfast menus, could not follow it.

The ship itself was unlike anything any of them had seen. It was small
— perhaps thirty meters long — with a hull of a dark, smooth material
that reflected light in ways that made it hard to look at directly.
It had no visible engine, no visible propulsion system, no visible
anything that corresponded to human aerospace engineering. It sat in
the hangar like a stone in a jewelry box: dense, dark, and profoundly
out of place.

"Dad built this?" Thomas asked.

"Your father did not build it," Petersen said. "It was given to him."

"Given to him by whom?"

"That is explained in the letter."

The letter was in the ship — a sealed envelope taped to the inside
of the airlock, addressed to the three of them in Elliot Grey's
handwriting, which was small, angular, and precisely legible.

Martin opened it. Sandra read over his shoulder. Thomas read over
hers.

    Dear Martin, Sandra, and Thomas,

    If you are reading this, then I am dead and Petersen has done his
    job. I am sorry for the theater. I am sorry for a great many
    things, and I hope this letter explains at least some of them.

    In 1969, when I was twenty-six years old, I was working as a
    radio technician at a listening station in New Mexico. One night
    in August, I received a signal that was not from any human source.
    I traced the signal to its origin and found, buried in the desert
    approximately four miles from the station, a vessel identical to
    the one you are now standing in.

    The vessel was empty, but it contained two things: a set of
    technical documents and this ship. The documents described
    technologies that did not exist in 1969 — materials science,
    energy systems, computational methods that were decades ahead of
    anything human engineers had produced. The ship was transportation,
    provided for a purpose I will describe below.

    I spent the next fifty years using those documents to build a
    fortune. Every significant technology that Grey Industries has
    developed or patented — the superconducting materials, the quantum
    processors, the fusion catalysts — was derived, directly or
    indirectly, from the information in those documents. I did not
    invent these things. I decoded them. I translated alien engineering
    into human manufacturing. I was, to use the most honest word
    available, a plagiarist on a cosmic scale.

    The fortune I built belongs, in a moral sense, to the beings who
    provided the knowledge. They asked for one thing in return: that
    when I died, my heirs would use this ship to travel to their world
    and return the documents. That is all. No payment, no penalty, no
    additional obligation. Just the return of what was lent.

    I could have returned the documents myself. I did not, for reasons
    that I will not dignify by calling them anything other than
    cowardice. I was afraid of what I would find, afraid of what the
    journey would reveal about me and about the foundation of
    everything I had built. I postponed, delayed, and ultimately died
    without fulfilling my obligation.

    I am asking you to do what I could not.

    The ship is simple to operate — the controls are designed to be
    intuitive. The journey takes approximately seventy-two hours. The
    coordinates are programmed into the navigation system. The
    documents are in the cargo hold, in the same container in which
    I found them.

    I know this is a great deal to ask. I know you have reasons to
    be angry with me — some of which I understand and some of which I
    can only imagine. But this is the last thing I will ever ask of
    you, and it is, I believe, the most important.

    Your father,
    Elliot

Thomas was the first to speak. "Seventy-two hours to Alpha Centauri.
That's faster than light."

"Considerably faster," Sandra said. "Which means the ship's drive
technology alone is worth more than the entire estate."

"The ship is not part of the estate," Petersen said from the airlock.
"Your father's will specifies that the ship is to be returned with
the documents."

"Of course it is," Thomas said.

Martin said nothing. He was looking at the letter, reading it again,
and his face had the expression of a man who was doing the kind of
arithmetic that had nothing to do with numbers.

                               II.

They argued for three days.

Thomas wanted to go immediately. Thomas always wanted to do things
immediately, especially things that had a large payout. The trip was
simple: fly to Proxima Centauri, hand over the documents, fly back,
collect fourteen billion dollars. Three days of travel, one awkward
meeting with an alien species, and they were all rich beyond reason.
Thomas could not understand the hesitation.

Sandra wanted to analyze. Sandra always wanted to analyze. She spent
the three days reviewing the ship's technical specifications — or
trying to, since the specifications were written in a notation system
that no human engineer had seen before — and building financial models
of the estate's structure, looking for traps, contingencies, escape
clauses. She found none. The will was ironclad. Either they went, all
three, or the money went to charity.

Martin wanted to think. Martin always wanted to think, because thinking
was what you did before you built something, and building things
properly required understanding every load, every stress, every point
of potential failure. Martin was thinking about their father.

"He was a fraud," Martin said, on the third evening. They were sitting
in the hangar, eating takeout from the facility's small cafeteria,
the alien ship looming behind them like a question mark.

"He was a businessman," Thomas said. "Businessmen use whatever
resources are available. That's what business is."

"These weren't resources. They were stolen."

"They were given," Sandra corrected. "Read the letter. The aliens
provided the documents. They asked for their return. It was a loan,
not a theft."

"A loan implies informed consent on both sides. Did Dad's customers
know they were buying alien technology? Did his investors? Did the
patent office?"

"Does it matter? The technology works. The products work. The money
is real."

"The money," Martin said, "is the problem. Fourteen billion dollars,
built on technology that wasn't ours, that we didn't earn, that we
don't understand. And now we're supposed to fly to another star,
meet the beings who actually created it, and — what? Say thank you?
Say sorry? What do you say to someone whose work you've been passing
off as your own for fifty years?"

"You say 'here are your documents back' and you leave," Thomas said.
"That's what the letter says. That's all they asked for."

"Is it? Is that all?"

Thomas spread his hands. "I don't see a trap, Martin. I see a deal.
We hold up Dad's end, we get the money. Simple."

"Nothing about this is simple."

"Everything about this is simple. You're the one making it
complicated."

They looked at Sandra, because they always looked at Sandra when they
couldn't agree, and Sandra, who had been staring at the ship's hull
with the expression of someone solving a problem in her head, said
quietly: "We have to go. Not because of the money. Because Dad couldn't."

Martin and Thomas both started to speak. Sandra held up a hand.

"He was afraid. He spent fifty years afraid. And the fear — the
knowledge that everything he'd built was borrowed, that the
foundation was someone else's — that's what shaped him. That's why
he was the way he was. Distant. Guarded. Unable to — " She stopped.
"Unable to be honest. About anything. With anyone. Including us."

She looked at Martin. "You build bridges. You know what happens when
the foundation is wrong."

Martin nodded, slowly. "Everything above it is compromised."

"Everything above it is compromised. Our father's foundation was a
secret he couldn't face. This trip is the only way to make it right.
Not for the money. For the family."

Thomas opened his mouth, closed it, and for once in his life said
nothing.

                               III.

The ship flew itself, more or less. The controls were, as the letter
had promised, intuitive — three seats, a navigation display that
showed their route as a luminous thread through the dark, and a drive
system that activated with a whisper and carried them out of Earth's
atmosphere and into interstellar space with a smoothness that made
human spacecraft feel like covered wagons.

The journey took seventy-one hours.

They spent most of it in silence — not the uncomfortable silence of
people who have nothing to say, but the deep silence of people who
have too much to say and are waiting for the right moment. Martin sat
in the pilot's seat and watched the stars. Sandra sat in the
navigator's seat and made notes in a small leather journal. Thomas
sat in the third seat and, for the first time in his adult life,
thought about something other than money.

He thought about his father. He thought about a twenty-six-year-old
radio technician in the New Mexico desert, alone at night, receiving
a signal from another world. He thought about what it must have been
like to find the ship, to find the documents, to realize that the
universe was larger and stranger and more generous than anyone had
imagined. And he thought about the choice his father had made — to
use the gift, to build the fortune, to keep the secret — and he
understood, for the first time, that the choice had been a kind of
prison.

"He was lonely," Thomas said, somewhere around hour fifty.

Martin and Sandra looked at him.

"All that money, all those companies, all those employees and partners
and board members, and none of them knew the truth. He couldn't tell
anyone. He couldn't share it. He had the biggest secret in human
history and he had to carry it alone for fifty years."

"He could have returned the documents," Martin said. "He could have
gone himself."

"He was afraid."

"Yes."

"Are you afraid?"

Martin considered this. "Yes. But I'm going anyway."

"Yeah," Thomas said. "Me too."

The ship flew on. The stars were very bright.

                               * * *

The planet was small and green — a world of shallow seas and rolling
grasslands under a sky that was tinged with amber by Proxima Centauri's
red light. The ship descended on autopilot, settling onto a landing
pad that was clearly designed for it — the same dimensions, the same
orientation, a perfect fit.

They opened the airlock and stepped out.

The air was warm and smelled of something that was almost grass, almost
rain, almost familiar but not quite. The gravity was lighter than
Earth's — about eighty percent, Sandra estimated — and the light was
strange, warmer and softer than sunlight, casting shadows that were
long and diffuse.

The aliens were waiting.

There were three of them. They were tall — seven feet, perhaps — and
thin, with elongated limbs and faces that were smooth and featureless
except for large, dark eyes that reflected the amber sky like polished
stone. They wore simple garments of a material that moved like water,
and they stood in a row at the edge of the landing pad with a
stillness that suggested patience — not the impatient patience of
waiting, but the deep, settled patience of beings who had been patient
for a very long time and had become very good at it.

Martin carried the container. It was heavy — the documents inside
were inscribed on plates of the same material as the ship's hull —
and he set it on the ground between the humans and the aliens with
the careful precision of a man who understood that this was not a
transaction but a ceremony.

"Our father sends his apologies," Martin said. He did not know if
the aliens understood English. He did not know if they understood
speech. He said it anyway, because it needed to be said.

The center alien stepped forward. It knelt — a slow, deliberate
movement that folded its long body with an elegance that made Martin
think of origami — and placed one hand on the container. It looked
up at Martin, and its dark eyes, which had seemed featureless from a
distance, were, up close, full of depth and intelligence and something
that Martin could only describe as warmth.

"We know," it said. Its voice was quiet and resonant, like a cello
string. "We have been waiting. We are glad you have come."

"Our father was afraid," Sandra said.

"Yes. We knew. Fear is understandable. You are young, and the
universe is large. But you are here now, and that is what matters."

"That's it?" Thomas asked. He couldn't help himself. "We return the
documents and that's it? Debt paid?"

The alien looked at Thomas for a long moment. Then it did something
with its face — a subtle rearrangement of features that was,
unmistakably, a smile.

"The debt was never what you think it was," it said. "The documents
were a gift. The knowledge they contained was freely given. There was
no condition, no obligation, no debt to repay."

"Then why — " Martin began.

"Your father needed a reason to send you here. He knew you would not
come without one. The will, the condition, the money — these were
his way of ensuring that his children would do what he could not: stand
on another world and look into the face of the unknown without
flinching."

"He made up the debt?" Sandra said.

"He made up the structure. The need was real. Not our need — we did
not need the documents returned. Your need. The need of three human
beings to understand that the universe is not a place to be feared,
but a place to be met. Your father understood this, at the end. He
could not make the journey himself, but he could make certain that
you would."

The alien stood. It lifted the container and held it out to Martin.

"Keep the documents. Keep the knowledge. Use it well. That was always
the intention."

Martin took the container. His hands were steady. His eyes were not.

"Thank you," he said.

"You are welcome," the alien said. "As you have always been."

                               * * *

They flew home in silence — a different silence now, lighter, clearer,
the silence of people who have set something down and can feel the
difference in their shoulders.

Thomas did not calculate his share. Sandra did not analyze. Martin
flew the ship and watched the stars and thought about his father —
not the distant, guarded man he had known, but the young radio
technician in the desert, holding an alien signal in his hands,
terrified and wondering and alone, and deciding, in that moment, to
use what he had been given, even though the using would cost him
something he could not name and would spend fifty years trying to
repay.

They landed in the Nevada desert at dawn. The sun came up over the
mountains, orange and gold and ordinary, and the three of them stood
beside the alien ship and looked at the sky, which was the same sky
they had always known and was also, now, a different sky — a sky that
contained, somewhere beyond the blue, a world of green grass and amber
light and tall, patient beings who had given a gift and asked nothing
in return except that the recipients come to say hello.

Martin looked at his brother and his sister. Sandra looked at Martin.
Thomas looked at them both.

"So," Thomas said. "What do we do with fourteen billion dollars?"

Sandra almost smiled. "We could start by doing something Dad couldn't."

"What's that?"

"Tell the truth."

Martin nodded. The desert wind blew. The alien ship gleamed in the
morning light.

"Yeah," he said. "Let's start there."

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

ARTHUR WAINWRIGHT has been writing stories about robots and artificial
minds for this magazine since issue #4, and we consider ourselves
fortunate every time a new manuscript arrives in the mail. A mathematics
instructor at Northeastern University in Boston, he brings a
mathematician's precision and a philosopher's curiosity to questions
of machine consciousness that most writers treat as mere plot devices.
"The Robot Republic" is his most ambitious work to date — a full-length
exploration of what happens when machines are left alone long enough to
become civilized. He reports that the story was inspired by reading
John Locke's "Second Treatise of Government" and wondering what would
happen if the citizens of the social contract were made of steel rather
than flesh. He lives in Boston with his wife Eleanor and a chess set
that he describes as "the only opponent who never complains about my
opening."

MARGARET THORNTON holds a master's degree in marine biology from the
University of Washington and brings a scientist's eye to every world
she creates. Her stories have appeared in these pages under the byline
"M.E. Thornton" — a concession to convention that we hope she will
someday abandon, as her work needs no disguise. "The Orchid Equation"
represents her first venture into xenobotany, a sub-discipline of
science fiction she may well have invented with this story. She lives
on Orcas Island in Washington State, where she divides her time between
tide pool research, environmental activism, and the construction of
fictional worlds that are, in her words, "as carefully observed as
the real one, only stranger." We urge readers to pay close attention
to her work. She is writing at the peak of her powers.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY has been selling stories to science fiction
magazines since before most of our readers were born, and he writes
with the speed and assurance of a man who has told ten thousand tales
and intends to tell ten thousand more. A Chicago native and veteran of
the pulp magazines, he brings a storyteller's instinct to everything
he writes — his stories grip you on page one and don't let go until
the final sentence. "The Coyote Run" is, in this editor's opinion,
his finest work for our magazine: a smuggler's yarn with real moral
weight and a heroine you won't soon forget. He lives in Rogers Park,
Chicago, with his wife Carol and an indeterminate number of cats.

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW is, in the considered opinion of this editor, the
finest time travel writer working in the field today. A graduate of
the University of Pennsylvania, where she studied philosophy and logic,
she brings a logician's rigor and a playwright's wit to stories that
twist time into knots and then untie them with devastating elegance.
"Yesterday's Tomorrow" is a departure from her usual puzzle-box
construction — a warmer, more personal story than we have seen from her
before, and all the more powerful for it. She lives in Philadelphia with
her husband David, a journalist, and their two children, and reports
that the idea for the story came to her while planting petunias, which
she considers "entirely too appropriate."

AGNES WHITFIELD is a Kansas farm girl who writes science fiction at her
kitchen table, and she writes it with a clarity and emotional force
that would do credit to any writer in any genre. Her stories are set
in the aftermath of catastrophe, but they are not stories about
destruction — they are stories about what comes after, about the plain,
stubborn, heartbreaking work of rebuilding. "The Quiet After" is her
most devastating and her most hopeful story: a tale of extinction and
recovery that will, if this editor is any judge, stay with you for a
very long time. She lives on a small farm outside Salina, Kansas, with
her husband Lloyd, and she makes the best bread this editor has ever
tasted.

REX DRUMMOND was a bomber pilot in the Eighth Air Force during the
war, and he writes science fiction the way he flew missions: fast,
loud, and with total commitment. A Texan by birth and temperament, he
specializes in swashbuckling space opera that makes no apologies for
its enthusiasm and asks no quarter from the literary establishment.
"Colosseum of the Stars" is pure Drummond — a man with nothing but
his wits and his boots against impossible odds — and we defy any
reader to put it down before the final page. He lives in San Diego,
where he is reportedly at work on a novel about pirates in the Oort
Cloud. We await it with considerable anticipation.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, and we would not have it any other way. A technical writer
at General Motors by day and a fiction writer by night, he produces
stories with a reliability and craftsmanship that we have come to
depend upon. "The Inheritance" is typical of his best work: a clean,
well-constructed story about ordinary people in extraordinary
circumstances, told with the quiet authority of a man who has been
doing this for a long time and does it very well. He lives in
Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean and their three children.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading Issue #17 and I must register my strongest
objection to Dr. Koslov's "The Entanglement Postulate." The quantum
mechanics upon which the story's premise depends contains at least
three errors that any second-year physics student could identify. The
most egregious: entangled particles cannot transmit information faster
than light. Period. The story is beautifully written and emotionally
moving, which makes the scientific errors all the more frustrating.
When one builds a cathedral on a foundation of sand, the beauty of the
spires only makes the collapse more tragic.

                              — Dr. Franklin Oates
                                 Department of Physics
                                 California Institute of Technology

[Editor's note: Dr. Koslov has been informed of Dr. Oates's objections
and responds, with characteristic diplomacy, that "Dr. Oates is
technically correct, which is the most painful kind of correct." He
adds that the story's quantum mechanics are "aspirational rather than
descriptive" and that he hopes Dr. Oates will forgive the liberties
taken in the service of narrative. We suspect Dr. Oates will not, but
we live in hope. — M.S.]

Dear Editor,

More Rex Drummond, please! "Thunderbolt Station" in Issue #17 was the
most exciting thing I've read in months. I read it on the subway and
nearly missed my stop. Twice. My wife says I should sue the magazine
for reckless endangerment of commuters. I say Drummond is the best
adventure writer in the business and I will fight anyone who disagrees.

                              — Harold J. Baumgarten
                                 Brooklyn, New York

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am writing to express my deep appreciation for Agnes Whitfield's
"The Seed Vault" in Issue #16. As a farmer's daughter myself, I
recognized every detail — the quality of the soil descriptions, the
way she writes about weather, the plain-spoken dialogue that carries
more weight than all the fancy prose in the world. Mrs. Whitfield
writes about the end of the world the way my mother talks about a
hard winter: with respect for the difficulty and faith that spring
will come. Please tell her she has a devoted reader in Iowa.

                              — Mrs. Catherine Brandt
                                 Cedar Rapids, Iowa

Dear Sir,

I notice that your magazine employs female writers. I notice further
that their stories are indistinguishable in quality from those of the
male contributors. I notice that the sky has not fallen. I trust this
settles the matter.

                              — Miss Evelyn Marsh
                                 Boston, Massachusetts

[Editor's note: It does, as far as we are concerned. — M.S.]

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Wainwright's robots are getting smarter with every story. This worries
me. Not as a reader — as a reader, I find them fascinating. As a
citizen, I find them alarming. At what point does a fictional
exploration of machine intelligence become a warning? I think Mr.
Wainwright knows the answer and is too polite to say it directly.

                              — Dr. Helen Kowalski
                                 Ann Arbor, Michigan

We welcome your letters! Write to us at: Letters, Tales from the

================================================================================

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement has written what may be the purest example of "hard"
science fiction yet produced — a novel in which the science is not
merely the backdrop but the very engine of the narrative. Set on the
planet Mesklin, a massive, rapidly rotating disc-shaped world where
gravity ranges from three times Earth's at the equator to nearly seven
hundred times at the poles, the story follows the alien captain
Barlennan and his crew as they undertake a perilous journey to retrieve
a human probe stranded at the planet's pole. The physics are rigorous,
the alien culture is thoughtfully constructed, and the sense of wonder
is genuine. Mr. Clement proves that scientific accuracy and narrative
excitement are not enemies but allies. If the characters are somewhat
subordinate to the world-building, this is a minor quibble in an
otherwise superb achievement. Highly recommended for readers who like
their fiction built on a foundation of fact.

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Dr. Asimov, who has done more than any living writer to establish the
robot story as a serious literary form, here combines his robotics
with the detective novel to produce something genuinely novel: a
murder mystery set in a future New York where humans live in vast
enclosed cities and distrust their robot neighbors with a fervor that
would be comic if it were not so recognizable. Detective Elijah Baley,
a man of deep prejudices and deeper integrity, is partnered with the
robot R. Daneel Olivaw to solve a politically sensitive murder, and
the resulting investigation is as much about the detective's evolving
understanding of his partner as it is about the crime itself. The
world-building is superb — Asimov's enclosed cities are claustrophobic,
detailed, and utterly convincing — and the mystery is fair and
satisfying. Our own Arthur Wainwright, who has read the novel, reports
that he is "simultaneously delighted and annoyed" — delighted by the
quality, annoyed that Asimov got there first. We recommend it without
reservation.

FAHRENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Bradbury's slim, searing novel about a future in which books are
banned and "firemen" burn them is not, strictly speaking, a work of
science fiction in the hardware sense. There are no robots, no
spaceships, no alien worlds. What there is, instead, is a vision of
a society that has chosen entertainment over thought, comfort over
truth, and speed over depth — a society that is, Mr. Bradbury suggests
with uncomfortable persuasiveness, not very far from our own. Guy
Montag, the fireman who begins to question his vocation, is a simple
character in a complex world, and his awakening is rendered with Mr.
Bradbury's characteristic lyricism — prose that burns, appropriately
enough, with its own fierce light. The novel is brief, passionate,
and essential. Buy it, read it, and keep it where the firemen cannot
find it.

          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #20 — August 1954

We are pleased to announce the contents of our twentieth issue —
a milestone that we intend to celebrate with some of the finest
stories we have yet published:

"THE CARTOGRAPHER'S DILEMMA" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A mathematician
discovers that the map of the universe he has been constructing
contains a region that should not exist — a void with properties that
suggest it was deliberately created. A story about the limits of
knowledge and the terror of what lies beyond them.

"THE STING OF ANDROMEDA" by Robert "Bob" Finley — A con artist pulls
an elaborate heist on an orbital casino, and nothing — absolutely
nothing — goes according to plan. Finley's most inventive plot and
his most fun story. You have been warned.

"MERIDIAN" by Phyllis Crenshaw — A woman discovers that she is living
the same day repeatedly, but each repetition is slightly different,
and the differences are converging on an event she cannot prevent.
Crenshaw at her most structurally ingenious.

"THE IRON GARDEN" by Arthur Wainwright — A robot tasked with
maintaining a botanical garden on an abandoned space station begins
to develop its own aesthetic theory of horticulture. A quiet,
beautiful companion piece to this issue's "The Robot Republic."

Plus: new stories by Rex Drummond and Theodore Cain, letters from
our readers, book reviews, and more.
