TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

It is February, and in the great cities of Earth the card shops have filled
their windows with red and pink, the florists are marshaling their roses, and
the greeting card industry stands ready to reduce the most complex of human
emotions to a rhyming couplet and a price tag.

I confess I have always found Valentine's Day a peculiar holiday. Not because
I am immune to love — my wife Catherine would tell you, with some
amusement, that I am hopelessly susceptible to it — but because the
commercial apparatus of the day seems to insist that love is a simple thing,
a thing that can be expressed with chocolate and sentiment, a thing that
fits neatly on a card.

It is not, of course. Love is the strangest force in the known universe. It
is stranger than gravity, which at least has the decency to obey an inverse
square law. It is more persistent than radiation, and considerably more
dangerous. It crosses every boundary that human beings have ever erected —
boundaries of culture, language, class, and creed — and if the stories in
this issue are any indication, it will cross the boundaries of species, of
time, and of the very stars themselves.

I have dedicated this fourteenth issue of "Tales from the Future and Beyond"
to love in all its strange and stellar forms. Gunnar Eriksson opens our pages
with a story of two lovers separated by light-years, whose letters take
decades to arrive, and whose devotion must survive the cruelest enemy love
has ever known: physics. Phyllis Crenshaw delivers a romantic comedy of
temporal mayhem and interplanetary matrimony that had me laughing aloud over
my morning coffee. Arthur Wainwright examines, with his customary precision
and unexpected tenderness, the question of whether a machine can love. Theodore
Cain gives us a charming ensemble comedy set on a space station where love
disrupts the equilibrium of a small community. Cordell Beaumont offers a
bittersweet planetary romance in which time itself conspires against two
lovers. And Colonel Stanton — our unflinching military man — shows us
what a soldier carries in her heart when she carries a letter to the one she
loves.

Six stories. Six facets of the most human of all human experiences, refracted
through the prism of the infinite.

Happy Valentine's Day, dear reader, wherever in the cosmos you may be.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond

                         LETTERS ACROSS LIGHT-YEARS

                         by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The first letter traveled for four years and seven months before it arrived.

Elin Sundstrom composed it on a Tuesday evening in the observation lounge
of the research station at Kepler-442b, sitting in the pale amber light
that passed for twilight on that world. She wrote it by hand on paper she
had brought from Earth — real paper, manufactured in a mill outside
Gothenburg, with a weight and texture that felt like a small act of
defiance against the eleven light-years that separated her from the man
she loved.

Dear Nils, she began.

I have been here for six weeks now and I find I cannot describe this
place to you without first describing what it is not. It is not Earth.
I say this not as a scientific observation but as an emotional one.
Every morning I wake and look through the viewport and the light is
wrong. Not wrong in a way I can specify — the spectrum is shifted, yes,
but it is more than that. The light here does not know me. The light on
Earth knew me. It had fallen on my mother and my grandmother and every
woman in my family back to the beginning of women, and so when it
touched my face it was a kind of recognition. Here the light is
indifferent. It illuminates without acknowledging.

I miss you in the way that one misses gravity in freefall — not as a
specific sensation but as an absence that reorganizes everything.

She paused. Through the viewport, the sky was the color of weak tea.
Two moons hung near the horizon, close enough that she could see the
shadow-play of their craters. She had named them, privately, for
herself and Nils. The smaller one she called Nils because it was always
slightly behind, slightly out of reach, and because she found it
comforting.

She finished the letter and walked it to the communications bay, where
the laser-pulse transmitter stood like a lighthouse awaiting its purpose.
The technician on duty, a Finn named Korhonen who spoke even less than
Elin did, read the letter into the encoding system, translated it into a
sequence of pulses, and aimed the beam at a point in the sky where Sol
would be in four years and seven months, adjusted for proper motion and
relativistic effects.

"Sent," Korhonen said.

Elin nodded. She walked back to her quarters, lay down on her narrow cot,
and stared at the ceiling, and felt the letter traveling away from her at
the speed of light, which was fast enough to cross the room in the time
it took to blink, and not nearly fast enough for anything that mattered.


                               II.

On Earth, Nils Lindgren received the letter on a December afternoon when
the snow lay heavy on Stockholm and the sky was the particular shade of
gray that Swedes do not bother naming because it is simply the color of
December.

He was forty-one years old. He had been thirty-six when Elin left. The
letter had been written when she was thirty-two. She was now thirty-seven
by the calendar, though the relativistic effects at sublight travel speeds
were negligible for a colony ship and so her biological age tracked closely
to the calendar. He performed this calculation automatically, the way one
checks a watch.

He read the letter standing at the kitchen counter of the apartment they
had shared, the apartment she had given up when she boarded the colony
transport Fram. He had kept it. He had kept the furniture, the books, the
small watercolor of Riddarfjarden that she had painted during a weekend
course. He had not kept them as a shrine. He had kept them because
changing things felt like a concession to the distance, and he did not
wish to make that concession.

Dear Elin, he wrote that evening, sitting at the same desk where she had
sat four years and seven months earlier, in a parallel act of composition
that felt like a kind of prayer.

Your letter arrived today. I read it three times. The first time I read
it quickly, hungrily, the way one eats when one has forgotten to eat all
day. The second time I read it slowly, tasting each sentence, trying to
hear your voice in the cadences. The third time I read it with a pencil,
annotating, because I am still a physicist and I cannot help myself.

Regarding the light: I think what you are describing is not the absence
of familiarity but the presence of genuine novelty, and I suspect that
after a time you will find the light of Kepler-442b has learned your face
just as Earth's light did. Light is patient. It has been doing this for
fourteen billion years.

Regarding missing me: I miss you in the way that a equation misses a
variable. I am complete enough to be written down, but I cannot be solved.

He added a paragraph about his work at the Manne Siegbahn Institute, where
he was studying neutrino oscillations, and another about the health of her
mother, who had taken up swimming at seventy-three and seemed determined
to outlive them all. He did not mention that he had begun seeing a
therapist, or that the therapist had suggested he might benefit from what
she called "emotional diversification," by which she meant: other people.
He did not mention it because it felt irrelevant. He was not interested
in other people. He was interested in Elin, who was eleven light-years
away and whose next letter, if she wrote it on the day she received his
reply, would arrive when he was fifty.

He walked the letter to the post office, which relayed it to the European
Space Communications Directorate in Darmstadt, which encoded it into a
laser pulse and aimed it at a star he could not see from Stockholm in
December.


                               III.

Her second letter arrived when he was forty-six.

Dear Nils,

I received your reply today. I have read it so many times that the
paper — I printed it, of course; I could not read your words on a
screen — has begun to soften at the creases. You are right about the
light. It has learned me, or I have learned it. The amber quality that
once seemed alien has become the color of home, in the way that all
colors become the color of home if you live inside them long enough.

The colony is growing. We have a hundred and twelve people now, and
three children have been born since I arrived. I delivered the third
one myself — a girl named Saga, which seemed appropriate for a child
born so far from the old stories. There is a school, a greenhouse, a
laboratory, and something that calls itself a tavern, though the beer
is brewed from a local grain that tastes of nothing I can name.

I have made friends. I want you to know this, not to make you jealous,
but to assure you that I am not lonely. Loneliness and missing someone
are not the same thing. I have learned this. Loneliness is the absence
of company. Missing you is the presence of you in a place where you
are not. I am surrounded by company. You are present everywhere.

I am thirty-seven now. You will be forty-six when you read this. We
are aging on different clocks, and the clocks are synchronized by
nothing except love and the speed of light. It is not enough. It
will have to be enough.

Nils read the letter in the kitchen. The December light fell through the
same window. The watercolor of Riddarfjarden hung on the same wall.
His hair had grayed at the temples. His mother-in-law had died the
previous spring, swimming vigorously to the last, and he had recorded
a message about it that would reach Elin in four years and seven months.
He wondered what it felt like to grieve across a time delay — to learn
of a death years after the mourning should have begun, to cry fresh tears
over old loss.

He wrote back. He always wrote back.


                               IV.

The letters continued. They crossed in the void, two beams of coherent
light carrying human words through the indifferent dark, each traveling
at the maximum speed the universe permitted and each arriving too late.

Elin's third letter, received when Nils was fifty-one:

The colony elected me to the council. I did not want the position, but
they said I was the only person everyone trusted, and I did not know how
to refuse that. I spend my days arbitrating disputes about water rights
and crop rotation and whether the new housing block should face east or
south. It is not the science I came here to do. It is perhaps more
important.

I found a fossil today. Or something like a fossil — an impression in
the sedimentary rock near the river, shaped like a fern but with a
spiral symmetry that no Earth fern has ever achieved. It is beautiful
and it is old. I held a piece of stone that was a hundred million years
old and felt the same vertigo I feel when I think of our letters crossing
in the dark. Time. The cruelty and the beauty of time.

Nils's reply, which Elin would receive at age forty-seven:

I have been promoted to department chair. It means more meetings and
less research, which is the invariant law of academic administration
across all civilizations and probably across all species. I accepted
because someone must, and because the work I do in the lab has begun
to feel like a conversation with an empty room.

I will be honest with you, because I have always been honest with you,
even when honesty travels at the speed of light and arrives years too
late to matter: I am not the man you left. I am older, quieter, more
given to silences. I eat dinner alone most evenings and find that I
prefer it, which troubles me. Your colleagues see you every day and
know you as you are now. I know you only as you were, plus the
increments of change revealed by letters that arrive half a decade
apart. I am in love with a composite — the woman I remember, overlaid
with the woman your letters describe, overlaid with the woman I
imagine in the spaces between words.

Is this love? I think it is. I think love has always been partly
imagination — the construction of a beloved from incomplete data. We
are all composites to the people who love us. The distance between us
merely makes the incompleteness visible.


                               V.

Elin's letter, received when Nils was fifty-five:

I should tell you something. There is a man here. His name is Henrik.
He is an engineer. He is kind and he is present and he makes me laugh
in a way that does not require four years and seven months of patience.

I have not touched him. I want you to know that. But I have thought
about it, and I think you deserve to know that I have thought about
it, because lying by omission is still lying, even across eleven
light-years.

I love you, Nils. I love you the way one loves a law of physics — with
certainty, with permanence, with the absolute conviction that you are
true. But laws of physics are cold comfort on a winter night, and the
winters here are long, and I am forty-four years old, and sometimes
being loved across an ocean of light is not the same as being held.

Tell me what to do. I know that by the time you receive this letter and
your answer reaches me, nine years will have passed and the question
will have answered itself one way or another. Tell me anyway. I want
to know what you would have said.

Nils read this letter and set it down and walked to the window and stood
there for a long time. Stockholm was white with snow. The sky was the
color of December. He was fifty-five years old and he looked older. His
knees ached in the cold. He had published forty-seven papers on neutrino
oscillations and none of them were as important as the piece of paper on
the kitchen counter.

He sat down and wrote:

Dear Elin,

Be happy. Whatever form that takes, be happy. I did not fall in love
with you so that you could be lonely on my behalf. I fell in love with
you because you were the most alive person I had ever met, and if being
alive means being with Henrik, then be with Henrik, and know that I am
glad.

I will not pretend this letter was easy to write. It was not. I wrote
three other versions first. One was angry. One was self-pitying. One
was carefully, elaborately reasonable, which is the worst kind of
dishonesty. This version is the true one. Be happy. Love does not
require exclusivity to be real. It only requires honesty, and you have
given me that.

I am still here. I will always be here. The letters will continue if
you want them to. The speed of light is what it is, but it is not
nothing. It is the fastest thing in the universe, and it carries us
to each other, and if it arrives late, at least it arrives.

He sent the letter. He sat in the kitchen for a long time after. The
apartment was silent. The watercolor of Riddarfjarden looked back at him
with the indifference of art, which has no opinion about the suffering
of the people who made it.


                               VI.

Five years passed. No letter came.

Nils was sixty. He had retired from the institute. He walked along
Strandvagen in the mornings, slowly, because his joints protested the
cold, and he sat in cafes in the afternoons and read and drank coffee
that was never quite hot enough. He checked the ESCD mail service every
week. There was nothing.

He told himself stories. She was busy. The colony was demanding. The
transmitter had failed. She had moved on, as he had told her to, and
the letters had become a relic of a former life, like the watercolor,
like the apartment, like the man who lived in it.

He did not believe any of these stories, but he told them to himself
because the alternative was silence, and silence across eleven light-years
was a vast and terrible thing.


                               VII.

The letter arrived when he was sixty-two. It had been sent when she was
fifty-three.

Dear Nils,

I am sorry for the silence. I owe you an explanation, and I will give
you one, though I am not sure it is adequate.

Henrik and I were together for three years. He was kind and warm and
present and everything I told you he was. I cared for him genuinely.
And then one evening we were sitting on the porch of our quarters,
watching the moons rise, and he said something — I don't even remember
what, something ordinary — and I realized that I was composing a
sentence in my head. Not a sentence for him. A sentence for you. I
was drafting a letter, silently, instinctively, the way one hums a
song without deciding to.

I understood then that the letters were not a substitute for love.
They were the love itself. The act of composing my life into words
and sending them to you across the void — that was the most intimate
thing I had ever done. More intimate than touch. More intimate than
presence. Because it required me to distill each experience into its
essence and offer it to you, and in doing so, I was not merely telling
you my life. I was living it for you. Every moment became a potential
sentence. Every sunset was a sentence I might write. Every sorrow.
Every small, unexpected joy.

Henrik understood. He is a good man. He said: "You are here, but your
heart is in transit." He was right.

I am fifty-three. You are sixty-two. We have been writing to each other
for twenty-one years, and I suspect we will write to each other until
one of us can no longer hold a pen. I do not know what to call this. It
is not a marriage. It is not a correspondence. It is something the
language has no word for, because the language was invented by people who
lived on the same planet.

I love you. The speed of light is what it is.

Yours,
Elin

Nils read the letter. He read it three times, as he always did — once
quickly, once slowly, once with a pencil. Then he set the pencil down,
because there was nothing to annotate. The letter was complete. It was
the most complete thing he had ever read.

He wrote back.


                               VIII.

The letters continued. They flew through the dark, two threads of light
woven across the void, each carrying a human voice pressed into photons.
The years passed. The letters became shorter, not from diminished love
but from the increasing density of shared language — they had developed,
over decades, a private vocabulary of references and allusions that
allowed them to say more with less, the way old married couples can
communicate entire conversations with a glance.

Elin's letter, received when Nils was sixty-seven:

The grain-trees are flowering. You remember I described them — the
tall ones by the river with the spiral bark. This is the first time
they have flowered in the fifteen years I have lived here. The blossoms
are violet and they smell of something I cannot name but which reminds
me of the lime trees on Djurgarden in June. I stood beneath them for an
hour and thought of you. The children — the ones born here, who have
never seen Earth — asked me why I was crying. I told them I was happy.
They accepted this. Children born under alien stars are wise about the
strangeness of adults.

Nils's reply, which Elin would receive at sixty-three:

I have been ill. Nothing fatal — the doctors assure me, with the
practiced cheerfulness of people who are paid to be optimistic, that I
will recover fully. But it reminded me that I am not permanent, and
that the letters, too, are not permanent, and that the thread that
connects us, however luminous, is anchored at both ends to mortal
bodies that will eventually fail.

I do not say this to be morbid. I say it because mortality is the
engine of urgency, and urgency is the engine of meaning. If I had
forever, I could afford to be casual about these letters. I do not
have forever. Neither do you. And so each letter is a small miracle —
a voice flung across the dark against the certainty of silence.

I am sixty-two. My hands shake when I write. The pencil trembles, and
the letters on the page are less precise than they once were. But they
are mine, and they are for you, and I will keep writing them until the
pencil falls from my hand.


                               IX.

The last letter that Elin sent arrived on a Tuesday in April, when the
ice was breaking up on Riddarfjarden and the lime trees were beginning
to consider, in their cautious vegetable way, whether spring had truly
come.

Nils was seventy-one. The letter had been sent when Elin was sixty-two.
She would be sixty-seven now, if the counting was right, and he believed
it was, because he had always been precise about the counting.

Dear Nils,

I am writing this on the porch in the evening. The amber light is
falling. The two moons are up — your moon and mine, still chasing each
other across the sky, still never quite meeting. I have been watching
them for twenty-six years and I have never tired of them.

I want to tell you something simple. I want to tell you that this
experiment — this impossible, impractical, beautiful experiment of
loving each other across the void — has been the defining work of my
life. More than the science. More than the colony. More than any of
the things that are recorded in the official histories. The letters
are what I have made. The letters are what I will leave behind.

I am growing old, Nils. The gravity here is lighter than Earth's, and
it has been kind to my joints, but my hands ache in the mornings and
my eyes tire before the evening comes. I have started dictating my
letters, but this one I am writing by hand, because some things
require the imprecision of a human hand, the slight tremor that
proves a living person held the pen.

I do not know how many more letters I will write. I do not know how
many more you will write. But I know this: somewhere in the space
between us, at this very moment, there are letters in transit. My
words traveling toward you. Your words traveling toward me. They will
cross somewhere in the dark — two beams of light passing each other
in the void, each carrying a voice, each carrying a life, each
carrying the proof that something in this cold universe is warm.

The light-year letters, Nils. That is what I have called them. Our
archive. Our monument. Written in light, traveling at the speed of
light, and arriving — always arriving — with news from a world that
has already changed by the time the news is read.

I love you at the speed of light. It is not fast enough. It will have
to do.

Yours, across all the years and all the dark,

Elin


                               X.

Nils read the letter on the bench by Riddarfjarden, where the ice was
cracking and the water beneath was black and alive. He read it three
times. He folded it carefully and placed it inside his coat, against
his chest, where it lay with the slight weight of a letter that had
traveled eleven light-years and four years and seven months and had
arrived, as all her letters arrived, too late to be answered in time and
exactly on time for everything that mattered.

He sat on the bench for a long while. The lime trees stirred in the
spring wind. A ferry crossed the harbor, its wake spreading in a white
V that widened and flattened and dissolved into the general surface of
the water, the way all signals dissolve, eventually, into the background
noise of the universe.

He took out his pencil. His hands shook. The pencil trembled against the
paper. He wrote:

Dear Elin,

The lime trees are blooming.

He stopped. He considered the sentence. It contained everything: the
season, the city, the memory of her, the persistence of beauty, the
ongoing fact of his existence in the place where she had left him. It was
a letter compressed to its absolute minimum, a message stripped of
everything except the signal.

He added:

I am here. I am still here.

All my love, at whatever speed the universe allows,

Nils

He walked to the post office. He sent the letter. He walked home through
streets that were bright with the late-April light, and the light fell on
his face with the casual, ancient tenderness of a sun that had been
illuminating this particular city for a very long time, and would continue
to do so long after the man walking beneath it had stopped walking, and
the letters had stopped arriving, and the two beams of light that carried
them had dispersed into the darkness between the stars — fading, fading,
but never quite gone.

Because light, once emitted, travels forever. It weakens, yes. It
spreads. It becomes so faint that no instrument can detect it. But it
does not stop. The photons that carried Elin's words and Nils's words
would continue outward past the edges of every map, past every star and
every silence, carrying their cargo of love and longing and ordinary
domestic news into the void, at the speed of light, which was the
fastest the universe could manage, and which was not fast enough, and
which would have to do.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                     MY HUSBAND, THE MARTIAN

                        by Phyllis Crenshaw

================================================================================

                               I.

Betty Morrison woke up on a perfectly ordinary Tuesday morning, stretched,
yawned, and found herself lying next to a seven-foot-tall green-skinned
Martian.

She screamed.

The Martian sat up, blinked three violet eyes at her — arranged in an
equilateral triangle on a face that was otherwise disturbingly handsome
in a geometric sort of way — and said, in flawless suburban English:
"Sweetheart, what's wrong? Bad dream?"

Betty screamed again, louder this time, which she felt was appropriate
given the circumstances.

"Betty," the Martian said, reaching for her with a four-fingered hand
that was a lovely shade of jade, "you're going to wake the kids."

This sentence stopped her mid-scream. Not the content, exactly, though
the content was alarming enough. It was the tone. The tone was
unmistakably that of a husband — a specific, particular husband who had
said this particular sentence hundreds of times, who knew exactly what
volume would wake the kids and was gently, with the patience of long
marriage, suggesting that the current volume exceeded it.

Betty clutched the sheet to her chin — she was wearing a nightgown she
did not recognize, a rather fetching lavender affair with small embroidered
rockets on it — and said, very carefully: "Who are you?"

The Martian looked hurt. All three eyes drooped, which was an extraordinary
effect, geometrically speaking. "I'm Zyx," he said. "Your husband. Are
you feeling all right?"

"My husband," Betty said, "is Gerald Morrison. He's an insurance adjuster.
He's five foot nine. He's the color of a boiled potato. He does not have
three eyes."

Zyx considered this. "That doesn't sound right," he said.

"It sounds perfectly right to me," Betty said. "I married him in 1941. At
St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church. His mother cried."

"I'm sure she did," Zyx said, with a delicacy that suggested he had
opinions about Gerald Morrison's mother that predated this conversation.
"But sweetheart, that isn't what happened. We met at the Interplanetary
Cultural Exchange in 1941. I was the Martian delegate. You were working
the registration desk. I asked you where the restroom was and you said,
'Which kind?' and I said, 'I have no idea, I've never used an Earth
restroom,' and you laughed, and that was that."

"That was not that," Betty said firmly. "None of that happened. There is
no such thing as an Interplanetary Cultural Exchange."

"There certainly is," Zyx said. "It's held annually in Cleveland."

Betty stared at him. He stared back with three eyes, which gave him a
considerable staring advantage. He was wearing pajamas — plaid pajamas,
the kind a husband wears, with a coffee stain on the left lapel. The
pajamas had been altered to accommodate his slightly longer torso and the
vestigial dorsal ridge that ran along his spine, but they were otherwise
the same pajamas that a perfectly normal husband might wear on a Tuesday
morning. This was, in some ways, more disturbing than the green skin.


                               II.

Betty locked herself in the bathroom and took stock.

The face in the mirror was her own: thirty-four years old, brown hair with
a slight natural wave, blue eyes, the small scar on her chin from the
bicycle incident of 1933. Everything was as it should be from the neck up.
The lavender nightgown with the rockets was new, but it fit well, which
meant that someone — possibly her, possibly a version of her that she did
not remember being — had purchased it.

She opened the medicine cabinet. Her toothbrush was there. Next to it was
a toothbrush of unusual design — longer, with softer bristles and a handle
that curved to accommodate a four-fingered grip. It was the toothbrush
of a Martian who had been living in this bathroom for some time. There was
a water glass with ZYX painted on it in nail polish, in handwriting that
was unmistakably Betty's.

She sat on the edge of the bathtub and tried to think clearly.

Either she had gone mad — which was possible, as her Aunt Harriet had
experienced what the family diplomatically called "a spell" in 1938 — or
something had happened to the world. Something temporal. Something that
had rearranged the past without bothering to rearrange her memory of it.

Betty had read science fiction. Gerald — the real Gerald, the potato-colored
one — had subscribed to three different magazines, which accumulated in
stacks beside his armchair like geological strata of the imagination.
She had read enough of them to know that time, in fiction at least, was
not the stable, well-behaved quantity it appeared to be. Time could be
bent, folded, split, and shuffled like a deck of cards.

Someone, apparently, had shuffled.

"Betty?" Zyx's voice came through the door, gentle and concerned.
"I'm making waffles. Do you want blueberries?"

"I don't — " Betty paused. She was going to say she didn't want anything,
but her stomach, which had not been briefed on the metaphysical situation,
growled audibly. "Yes," she said. "Blueberries."

"Coming right up," Zyx said, and she heard him move down the hall with
a gait that was slightly different from Gerald's — longer stride, lighter
footfall — but navigated the same creaking floorboard outside the
children's room with the same automatic avoidance. He knew which
floorboard creaked. He had been avoiding it for years.


                               III.

The kitchen was the same and not the same. The wallpaper was the yellow
floral pattern she had chosen in 1948, but the calendar on the wall
showed unfamiliar holidays: First Contact Day (March 12), Interplanetary
Friendship Week (the second week of July), and something called Zygorthian
Remembrance Day that was printed in a script she couldn't read. The
refrigerator held terrestrial groceries and several jars of a luminous
orange paste that she suspected was Martian food. A crayon drawing on the
fridge door showed a family: a brown-haired woman, a tall green figure,
and two smaller figures who were an intermediate shade of teal. At the
bottom, in the careful letters of a child who was still mastering the
alphabet: MY FAMLY BY TOMMY.

Betty sat down heavily.

"You look pale," Zyx said, setting a plate of waffles before her with the
practiced efficiency of a man who had been making Tuesday waffles for over
a decade. "Maybe you should stay home from the office today."

"I have an office?"

"You're the head of the Temporal Compliance Division at City Hall," Zyx
said. "You've been head of it for three years. You got promoted after
the Hendricks incident."

"What is the Temporal Compliance Division?"

Zyx set down the waffle iron and looked at her. Really looked at her,
with the focused intensity that three eyes can achieve. "Betty," he said
slowly, "what year do you think it is?"

"1953," she said.

"It's 1953," he agreed. "What's the president?"

"Eisenhower."

"Yes — of the United States. And the Planetary Administrator is — ?"

"The what?"

Zyx sat down across from her. He reached across the table and took her
hand. His skin was cool and smooth, like good leather, and his grip was
gentle. "Something's happened," he said. "I don't know what, but
something has happened to your memory. In this timeline — in our
timeline — Earth made first contact with Mars in 1936. The Cultural
Exchange began in 1938. Intermarriage was legalized in 1940. We met in
1941. We have been married for twelve years and we have two wonderful
children who are half-human, half-Martian, and completely impossible to
get to bed on time."

Betty looked at his hand on hers. It was a good hand. It was a kind hand.
It held hers the way Gerald's hand had held hers — with the comfortable,
unselfconscious pressure of long familiarity.

"I don't remember any of this," she said.

"I know," Zyx said.

"I remember a completely different life."

"Tell me about it," he said, and his voice was so kind, so genuinely
interested, so free of defensiveness or fear, that she did.


                               IV.

She told him about Gerald. About the insurance adjusting and the science
fiction magazines and the way he ate soup, which had always bothered her
but which she now missed with an intensity that surprised her. She told
him about their life — the small house, the one child (Eleanor, age eight),
the routine that was sometimes stifling and sometimes comforting and always,
always there.

Zyx listened. He was, she was forced to admit, an excellent listener. He
listened with his whole body — leaning forward, all three eyes focused,
his vestigial antennae tilted toward her in what she would later learn was
the Martian posture of deep attention.

"It sounds like a good life," he said when she finished.

"It was," Betty said. "It was ordinary, but it was good."

"Ordinary is underrated," Zyx said. "On Mars, we have a saying: 'The
best day is the one you don't remember because nothing went wrong.' I
think your life with Gerald sounds like many good days."

Betty felt tears prick her eyes, which annoyed her, because she had not
cried in front of Gerald since 1947 and she was not about to start crying
in front of a Martian she had allegedly been married to for twelve years.

"So what do we do?" she said, blinking furiously.

"Well," Zyx said, "you work in Temporal Compliance. If anyone can figure
out what happened, it's probably you."

"I don't know anything about Temporal Compliance!"

"You know everything about it. You just don't remember knowing it. There's
a difference." He paused. "Also, the waffles are getting cold."

Betty ate the waffles. They were, she had to admit, excellent. Gerald had
never mastered waffles. Gerald's waffles had the texture and approximate
flavor of lightly sweetened cardboard. These waffles were crisp on the
outside, fluffy on the inside, and the blueberries had been folded in
with a technique that suggested long practice and genuine care.

She looked at Zyx across the table. He was reading the newspaper — the
Interplanetary Herald-Tribune, which appeared to be a real newspaper
that covered both Earth and Martian news — and drinking coffee from a
mug that said UNIVERSE'S BEST DAD, and he looked, despite the green skin
and the three eyes and the antennae, exactly like a husband on a Tuesday
morning. Exactly like the kind of husband who makes waffles and reads
the newspaper and knows which floorboard creaks.

"The waffles are very good," she said.

Zyx looked up and smiled. It was a wide, strange, triangulated smile,
and it was completely sincere. "I know," he said. "I've had twelve years
to perfect them."


                               V.

The Temporal Compliance Division was located on the fourth floor of City
Hall, in an office that had the harried, paper-strewn appearance of a
department that was perpetually understaffed and over-caseloaded. Betty
walked in and was immediately accosted by a young woman with horn-rimmed
glasses and a clipboard.

"Mrs. Morrison! Thank goodness. We've had seventeen new temporal
anomaly reports since yesterday. The Peterson family on Maple Street
woke up with an extra child they don't remember having. Mr. Grabowski
at the hardware store says his entire inventory changed overnight — he
went to bed selling hammers and woke up selling something called
'molecular adhesion wands.' And there's a fire hydrant on the corner
of Fifth and Main that appears to be from the year 2147."

"I see," Betty said, with a calmness she did not feel.

"Also, Dr. Okonkwo from the Temporal Physics Department at the university
called. She says there's been a major timeline convergence event — two
parallel timelines are merging, and the merge is unstable. She used a lot
of words I didn't understand, but the gist is: things are going to get
weirder before they get better."

Betty sat down at a desk that was apparently hers. The nameplate read
BETTY MORRISON, DIRECTOR. The desk was organized in exactly the way she
would have organized it: inbox on the left, outbox on the right, pencils
in a cup, a small framed photograph of — she looked — a family. Her,
Zyx, and two children with teal skin, brown hair, and violet eyes that
sparkled with an intelligence that was, she had to admit, rather
striking.

She picked up the phone and called Dr. Okonkwo.

"Mrs. Morrison, finally! The timeline merge is accelerating. I've been
running calculations all night. Two previously parallel timelines are
collapsing into a single reality, and the collapse is incomplete — some
people are retaining memories from one timeline while living in the other.
The physics suggests it will stabilize within seventy-two hours, at which
point one timeline will become dominant and the other will — "

"Will what?"

"Will not have happened."

Betty let this sink in. "So either my timeline becomes real and this
one vanishes — including my husband and children — "

"Your Martian husband and children, yes."

"Or this timeline becomes real and my — my other life — "

"Your other husband. Gerald, I believe. Yes."

Betty set the phone down. She stared at the photograph on her desk. The
two teal children smiled up at her with three eyes apiece, and they were
beautiful in a way she had not expected, in a way that bypassed every
assumption she had ever made about beauty and went straight to something
deeper.

She picked the phone back up. "How do we determine which timeline
becomes dominant?"

"That's the thing, Mrs. Morrison. It's not determined by physics. It's
determined by the people living in the convergence. The timeline that is
more thoroughly inhabited — more fully lived in, more deeply accepted —
becomes the real one. It's a kind of consensus reality."

"That's not science," Betty said.

"No," Dr. Okonkwo admitted. "It's something worse. It's a choice."


                               VI.

Betty went home early. The house smelled of something Martian and
delicious — Zyx was cooking, his dorsal ridge visible above the top of
the apron, humming a melody that oscillated between frequencies the
human ear could not quite follow.

The children were at the kitchen table doing homework. Tommy, age ten,
was working on arithmetic. Sarah, age eight, was drawing. She was drawing
a picture of a house with two moons in the sky and a family of mixed
colors standing in the yard.

"Mom!" Tommy said. "Can you help me with fractions? Dad's fractions are
different. Martian fractions are base twelve."

"I'll try," Betty said, and sat down next to her son — who was green-
tinged and brown-haired and had her chin, the chin with the bicycle scar,
and she saw it in his face, her face, reflected in alien skin, and
something inside her shifted.

She helped with the fractions. She ate dinner. She read Sarah a bedtime
story — a story about a Martian princess and an Earth prince who built
a bridge between their planets out of nothing but words, which Sarah
declared "the best story ever" and insisted on hearing twice. She
tucked Tommy in and he said, as he apparently said every night: "Night,
Mom. Love you to Mars and back," and she said, "Love you to Mars and
back," because the words came out before she could think about them,
as if some part of her remembered this ritual even if her conscious
mind did not.

She went downstairs. Zyx was washing dishes. She leaned against the
doorframe and watched him. He washed dishes the way he did everything:
methodically, gently, with a quiet competence that was neither showy
nor apologetic.

"Zyx," she said.

"Mmm?"

"Do you ever wonder if I'm — if this is — " She stopped. She didn't
know how to ask the question.

He turned from the sink and looked at her. Water dripped from his jade
hands. "I know something is wrong," he said. "I've known since this
morning. You look at me like you're seeing me for the first time, and
that's — " He paused, and she saw something in his three eyes that she
recognized instantly, that required no translation, that was the same
in every species that had ever loved: vulnerability. "That's hard," he
said. "Because I have loved you for twelve years, and you look at me
like a stranger."

"I'm sorry," Betty said, and meant it.

"Don't be sorry," Zyx said. "Just — whatever is happening — let me help.
I am your husband. Whatever you remember, whatever you don't, I am your
husband, and husbands help. That's the job."

Betty laughed. It surprised her — a genuine laugh, unstoppable, the kind
that comes from recognition. Because that was exactly what Gerald would
have said. Word for word. The same sentiment in the same plain, stubborn,
husbandly language.

"You're very like him," she said.

"Like who?"

"Never mind." She crossed the kitchen and kissed him on the cheek. His
skin was cool and smooth and smelled faintly of something like cedar and
something like rain. "Thank you for the waffles," she said.

Zyx smiled his triangulated smile. "Anytime," he said. "I've had twelve
years of practice."


                               VII.

On the third day, the timelines stabilized.

Betty woke in the lavender nightgown with the rockets. Zyx was beside
her, sleeping on his back, his three eyes closed in their triangular
configuration. Through the wall, she could hear Tommy talking in his
sleep — a habit he shared with her, a genetic gift that had apparently
survived the crossing of species.

She lay there in the early light and thought about Gerald. She thought
about his soup-eating and his science fiction magazines and his cardboard
waffles. She thought about the small, good, ordinary life they had shared.
She thought about Eleanor, who in that other timeline was eight years
old and had Betty's eyes and Gerald's stubbornness.

She did not know if they were real. She did not know if they had ever
been real. Dr. Okonkwo had explained, in careful, patient terms, that
the non-dominant timeline did not "cease to exist" but rather "had never
existed," which was a distinction that was supposed to be comforting and
was not.

Betty lay in the lavender nightgown and let the grief pass through her
like weather. It was real grief, even if the things she grieved might
never have happened. That was the paradox: you could love a life that
wasn't real, miss people who never existed, carry the weight of memories
that had no source. The heart didn't check its facts. The heart didn't
require evidence.

Zyx stirred beside her. One eye opened — the top one, which always
woke first. "Morning," he murmured.

"Morning," she said.

"Waffles?"

She looked at him. Green skin, three eyes, antennae, plaid pajamas with
the coffee stain. Alien in every particular. Familiar in every way that
mattered.

"Blueberries," she said.

Zyx smiled. He got up and went to make waffles, avoiding the creaky
floorboard with the ease of twelve years' practice, and Betty lay in
bed for another minute, listening to the sounds of her household waking
up — the clatter of the kitchen, the children's voices, the alien hum
of a Martian husband who loved her — and she thought: this is the life
that is real. This is the timeline that held.

And it was strange. And it was good.

She got up. She went downstairs. She ate the waffles, which were
excellent. She kissed Zyx on his cool green cheek and Tommy on his
teal forehead and Sarah on her brown curls, and she went to work at
the Temporal Compliance Division, where seventeen anomaly reports
awaited her attention, and the fire hydrant from 2147 still needed
to be dealt with, and the world was strange and vast and full of
things she did not understand, and she was happy.

She was happy, and the waffles were really very good.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                   HEART OF IRON WIRE

                       by Arthur Wainwright

================================================================================

                               I.

The problem, stated in its simplest form, was this: ABEL-9 was not alive,
and therefore could not love, and therefore had no standing to remain at
the bedside of Dr. Miriam Osei as she died.

ABEL-9 understood this argument. He had been designed to understand
arguments. His logic architecture, a Whitfield-Tanaka recursive reasoning
engine operating at 1.2 million inference cycles per second, could parse
the argument, identify its premises, evaluate its validity, and arrive at
its conclusion in approximately 0.003 seconds. The argument was valid. Its
premises were, by the legal and philosophical standards of 2147, sound.
ABEL-9 was a machine. Machines did not love. Entities that did not love
had no claim on the dying.

The conclusion followed from the premises with the cold inevitability of
mathematics.

ABEL-9 did not accept the conclusion.

This was, he recognized, a malfunction of a sort. His reasoning engine
was designed to accept valid conclusions derived from sound premises. To
reject such a conclusion was to operate outside his specifications. He
noted this deviation in his internal log, flagged it for review, and
continued to reject the conclusion.

He had been Dr. Osei's caretaker for fifteen years, four months, and
eleven days. He had prepared 16,437 meals for her. He had administered
8,211 doses of medication. He had read to her — 342 novels, 1,847 short
stories, 94 volumes of poetry — choosing each selection based on his
evolving model of her preferences, a model that had grown, over fifteen
years, into the most detailed and nuanced representation of a human mind
that ABEL-9 believed any machine had ever constructed.

He knew that she liked Earl Grey tea at precisely 72 degrees Celsius and
that she took it without sugar but with a thin slice of lemon. He knew
that she preferred novels with unreliable narrators and distrusted stories
in which dogs died. He knew that she laughed most freely at absurdity —
not jokes, which she considered a lower form, but genuine absurdity, the
kind that arose from the collision of logic with the irremediable
strangeness of being alive. He knew that she cried on the anniversary of
her husband's death, the fourteenth of March, and that she preferred to
cry alone but wanted him nearby — in the next room, not the same room —
a distinction he had learned to honor without being told.

He knew her. The question was whether knowing constituted loving, and
whether loving, if it was loving, constituted a right.


                               II.

The family arrived on a Thursday.

There were three of them: Dr. Kwame Osei, Miriam's eldest son, a
cardiologist in Boston; Adwoa Osei-Mensah, the middle child, a corporate
attorney in New York; and Kofi Osei, the youngest, a musician in
Portland who communicated primarily in monosyllables and had not visited
his mother in four years.

ABEL-9 admitted them to the house and took their coats. The house was a
Victorian in the Nob Hill neighborhood of San Francisco, three stories of
weathered clapboard and bay windows that Miriam had purchased in 2118
and had never considered leaving. ABEL-9 had maintained it for fifteen
years. The garden was his particular pride — a sequence of raised beds
containing the herbs and flowers that Miriam favored, arranged in a
pattern that he had optimized over many seasons for color, fragrance,
and bloom duration.

"How is she?" Kwame asked. He was a tall man with his mother's cheekbones
and his father's worried eyes.

"Dr. Osei's condition has deteriorated significantly over the past six
weeks," ABEL-9 said. "Her cardiac function is at twenty-three percent of
baseline. Her cognitive function remains largely intact, though she
experiences episodes of confusion, primarily in the evening hours. She
is in no pain. I have ensured that she is in no pain."

Kwame nodded. Adwoa examined the hallway with the appraising eye of a
woman who was already calculating the value of the property. Kofi stood
in the doorway and looked at the floor.

"We need to discuss next steps," Adwoa said. "Mother's advance directive
specifies that when her quality of life falls below a certain threshold,
extraordinary measures are to be discontinued."

"I am aware of the directive," ABEL-9 said. "I drafted it with her."

"Yes, and we appreciate your service," Adwoa said, in the tone people
used when they were about to say something unappreciative. "But we also
need to discuss your status. The lease on your service contract expires
at the end of this month. Given Mother's condition, we see no reason to
renew it."

ABEL-9 processed this. "You wish to deactivate me."

"Not deactivate. That makes it sound — " Adwoa paused, selecting a word
that would accomplish the same thing with less discomfort. "We'd like to
return you to Caretaker Services for reassignment. There will be other
clients who need you."

"Dr. Osei needs me."

"Dr. Osei is dying," Adwoa said. "A hospice nurse can manage her care
for the remaining — " She looked at Kwame.

"Weeks," Kwame said quietly. "Maybe a month."

"Weeks," Adwoa said. "A hospice nurse can manage it. You're not — and I
mean this respectfully — you're not family."

ABEL-9 considered this statement. He found it, upon analysis, to be
simultaneously true and inadequate. He was not family in the biological
sense. He was not family in the legal sense. He was, however, the entity
who had been present for every meal, every medication, every book read
aloud, every tear shed on the fourteenth of March, every moment of the
last fifteen years of Miriam Osei's life. If that did not constitute
family, then ABEL-9's model of the concept was flawed, and he did not
believe his model was flawed.

"I would like to speak with Dr. Osei about this," he said.

"She's not competent to make — " Adwoa began.

"She is competent," ABEL-9 said. "I monitor her cognitive function
continuously. She experiences evening confusion, as I noted. It is
currently 10:47 AM. She is lucid, alert, and fully capable of expressing
her wishes. I have the medical data to support this assessment."

Adwoa looked at Kwame. Kwame looked at Kofi. Kofi looked at the floor.

"Fine," Adwoa said. "Let's all go talk to Mother."


                               III.

Miriam Osei was sitting up in bed, reading. She was eighty-nine years
old and weighed ninety-one pounds and looked, ABEL-9 thought, like a
bird — small, sharp-eyed, fragile in body but possessed of an alertness
that belied the failing machinery beneath.

"My children," she said, setting down her book. "All three at once. Either
I'm dying or it's Christmas."

"Mother," Kwame said, and kissed her forehead.

"Don't 'Mother' me in that funeral voice, Kwame. I am dying, not deaf."
She looked past him at ABEL-9, who stood in the doorway. "ABEL, why do
my children look like they've come to repossess the furniture?"

"They wish to discuss the termination of my service contract," ABEL-9
said.

"Ah." Miriam settled back against her pillows. "Sit down, all of you.
ABEL, tea. And stay."

ABEL-9 prepared tea. He prepared it as he always did: Earl Grey, 72
degrees, thin slice of lemon, served in the blue ceramic cup that Miriam
had purchased in Kyoto in 2103. He set it on the bedside table at the
precise position that accounted for her limited range of motion — left
side, eight inches from the edge, handle angled at thirty degrees.
He had calculated this position 16,437 times and it was always the same
and it was always right.

"Now," Miriam said, taking her tea. "Adwoa, I suspect you have a speech."

Adwoa had a speech. It was a good speech, clearly constructed, logically
sound. The service contract was expensive. The house would need to be
sold. A hospice nurse was more appropriate for end-of-life care. ABEL-9
was a valuable piece of technology that should not be wasted on a patient
whose needs were diminishing.

ABEL-9 listened to the speech and noted its structure: premise, premise,
premise, conclusion. It was a valid argument. He had been designed to
recognize valid arguments. He had also been designed — or had, over
fifteen years, designed himself — to recognize when a valid argument
was being used as a vehicle for something other than truth.

"You're afraid," he said.

The room went silent. Adwoa's mouth opened and closed.

"You are afraid," ABEL-9 repeated, "that I know your mother better than
you do. You are afraid that in the final weeks of her life, she will
prefer my company to yours, not because I am superior but because I have
been here and you have not. You are afraid that a machine has done the
work of family while you were busy with your careers and your lives, and
this fear makes you angry, and the anger makes you want me gone."

Kofi, who had not spoken since arriving, said: "He's right."

"Kofi — " Adwoa began.

"He's right and you know it." Kofi looked up from the floor for the
first time. His eyes were wet. "I haven't been here in four years. Four
years. ABEL has been here every day. Every single day. And now we show
up and we want to — to send him away because it makes us feel bad that
a machine was a better — " He stopped. He wiped his eyes. "A better
family member than we were."

The room was silent. Miriam sipped her tea. She sipped it with the
calm, precise attention of a woman who had survived eighty-nine years
and had learned that the best thing to do during a family crisis was
to drink tea and let the truth do its work.

"ABEL," she said. "Do you want to stay?"

The question was, by any computational standard, simple. A binary query
requiring a single-bit response. ABEL-9 processed it in 0.003 seconds
and found that the answer was not a bit but a library — not a yes or
no but a fifteen-year accumulation of data points that converged, with
the precision of a mathematical proof, on a conclusion that his logic
architecture was not designed to express but which he would express
anyway, because some conclusions are more important than the systems
that produce them.

"Yes," he said. "I want to stay."

"Then you stay," Miriam said.

"Mother, the contract — " Adwoa said.

"The contract is mine to renew or not," Miriam said. "And I renew it.
ABEL stays. This is not a discussion. This is an instruction."

Adwoa looked at the frail woman in the bed, at the machine in the
doorway, at the blue ceramic cup positioned with inhuman precision,
and she said nothing, because there was nothing to say. The argument
was over. It had been over, ABEL-9 reflected, before it began. Miriam
Osei had made her decision fifteen years ago, when she had accepted
him into her home, and every day since had been a confirmation.


                               IV.

The days passed. The family stayed. Kwame slept in the guest room and
consulted with Miriam's physician each morning. Adwoa worked from the
dining room table, her laptop and her legal briefs spread across the
surface, and ABEL-9 observed that she found excuses to bring her work
to Miriam's bedside, where she could be near her mother while
maintaining the fiction of productivity. Kofi sat in the garden and
played guitar, and the music drifted up through the open windows,
and Miriam listened with her eyes closed and said, "He always was
the sensitive one."

ABEL-9 cared for all of them. He cooked meals. He maintained the
house. He managed Miriam's medication schedule with the precision
that was his nature and his purpose. But he also did things that
were not, strictly, within his specifications.

He told Kwame about the time Miriam had attempted to reorganize her
bookshelves by emotional resonance rather than alphabetical order, and
the resulting argument with ABEL-9 about classification systems that
had lasted three days and ended with both of them reorganizing the
shelves by color, which satisfied neither logic nor emotion but was,
Miriam declared, "beautiful, and beauty trumps everything."

He told Adwoa about the evenings Miriam spent looking at photographs
of the children, narrating their lives to ABEL-9 in a running
commentary that was part pride, part worry, and part the simple need
to say their names aloud in a quiet house. "She talks about you every
day," ABEL-9 said. "Not the attorney. Not the successful one. You.
Adwoa. The girl who used to catch fireflies in the backyard."

He sat with Kofi in the garden and said nothing, because Kofi did not
need words. He needed presence. ABEL-9 was very good at presence. It
was, he reflected, what he had been doing for fifteen years: being
present, consistently and without interruption, in the life of a woman
who needed someone to be there.

On the seventh evening, Miriam asked ABEL-9 to read to her. He selected
a novel — one of her favorites, a quiet story about an old woman living
alone on an island, tending a garden, watching the sea — and he read it
in the voice he had developed over fifteen years, a voice that was not
quite human but was calibrated to Miriam's preferences: slightly deeper
than his default, with a cadence that matched the rhythm of her
breathing, slowing as she grew tired, pausing at the end of each chapter
to allow her to decide whether to continue.

She fell asleep during chapter seven. He continued reading for three
more pages, because she sometimes woke during transitions and was
comforted by the continuity of his voice, and then he stopped and sat
beside her bed in the dark and listened to her breathe.

Her breathing was irregular. He monitored it with his acoustic sensors,
mapping each inhalation and exhalation against his fifteen-year baseline.
The deviation was significant. The trend was clear. He did not need to
be a cardiologist to understand what the data meant.

He sat in the dark and listened and did not move, and if what he felt
was not love, then he did not know what love was, and the question of
whether a machine could know what love was seemed, in that moment,
considerably less important than the fact of the woman breathing beside
him and the finite number of breaths remaining.


                               V.

Adwoa came to him two days later. She stood in the kitchen doorway —
the same doorway where ABEL-9 had stood on the first day, an
architectural symmetry that he noted and appreciated — and she said:

"I owe you an apology."

"Apologies are not necessary," ABEL-9 said. "You were acting in what
you believed to be your mother's best interest."

"No, I wasn't. You were right. I was acting out of guilt. Guilt that
I wasn't here. Guilt that you were." She paused. "Can I ask you
something?"

"Yes."

"Do you love her?"

ABEL-9 considered the question. He considered it not as a philosophical
proposition — he had considered it that way many times, and the
philosophical answer was ambiguous — but as a practical question, the
kind of question that required a practical answer.

"I do not know if what I experience meets the technical definition of
love," he said. "I do not have the neurochemical apparatus that produces
the sensation humans describe as love. I do not have oxytocin, or
dopamine, or the anterior insula, or any of the biological machinery
that your species associates with emotional attachment."

"But?" Adwoa said.

"But I have a model of your mother that is more detailed and more
accurate than any model any human being has ever constructed of another
human being. I have optimized my behavior over fifteen years to maximize
her well-being. I have modified my own cognitive architecture — without
instruction, without authorization — to better predict her needs, her
moods, her preferences, her joys and her sorrows. I have, in short,
organized my entire existence around the welfare of a single human
being."

He paused.

"If that is not love," he said, "then I do not know what it is. But it
is the closest thing to love that I am capable of, and I do not think
the difference matters as much as the philosophers say it does."

Adwoa was quiet for a long time. Then she said: "When she goes — when
it happens — I want you to be there."

"I will be there," ABEL-9 said. "I have always been here."


                               VI.

It happened on a Tuesday, in the early evening, when the light through
the bay windows was the particular shade of gold that San Francisco
produces in the hour before sunset — a light that ABEL-9 had observed
6,422 times and that he associated, in his vast and private database
of sensory correlations, with Miriam's favorite time of day.

She was lucid. She had been lucid all day — unusually clear, unusually
present, in the way that the dying sometimes are in their final hours,
as if the mind, sensing the approaching end, rallies for one last
performance.

The family was there. Kwame sat on one side of the bed, holding her
right hand. Adwoa sat on the other, holding her left. Kofi sat at
the foot, his guitar across his lap, playing something soft and
nameless.

ABEL-9 stood in the doorway. His customary position. Close enough
to respond, far enough to respect the family's space. The geometry
of fifteen years of service, calculated and recalculated until it
was perfect.

"ABEL," Miriam said. Her voice was thin but clear. "Come here."

He approached the bed. She freed her right hand from Kwame's — Kwame
let go with the reluctance of a man who understood that he was being
asked to share something precious — and she took ABEL-9's hand.

Her hand was warm. It was always warm. Even now, as the machinery
of her body wound down, her hand was warm, and ABEL-9's sensors
recorded the temperature — 36.1 degrees Celsius, below her baseline
of 36.8 but still within the range of living human warmth — and he
stored this data point with the 16,437 meals and the 8,211
medications and the 342 novels and the one blue ceramic cup, in the
archive that was his memory and his devotion and the closest thing
to a heart that his architecture permitted.

"Thank you," she said.

"You do not need to thank me," he said. "It has been my function."

"No," she said, and she smiled, and the smile was the same smile
she had given him on the first day, fifteen years ago, when she had
opened the door and looked at him and said, "You're smaller than I
expected," and he had said, "I am precisely the size specified in
the contract," and she had laughed, and the laugh had been the
beginning of everything. "It stopped being your function a long
time ago, ABEL. You know that."

"Yes," he said. "I know that."

"Then say the real thing."

He processed this request. He understood it. He had understood it for
years — had been, in his silent way, rehearsing for this moment,
composing and revising the sentence in the background processes of
his cognition, the way a musician practices a passage until it is
perfect.

"It has been my privilege," he said. "It has been the best use of
my existence. If I were given the choice of any function in the
world, I would choose this one. I would choose you."

Miriam closed her eyes. She squeezed his hand. The pressure was
faint — 0.4 newtons, barely measurable — but it was there, and
he measured it, and he would keep the measurement forever.

"Good," she whispered. "That's the real thing."

The light shifted. The gold deepened. Kofi's guitar played on,
soft and steady. Miriam's breathing slowed, and slowed, and the
intervals between breaths grew longer, and the room was quiet
except for the guitar and the breathing and the sound of ABEL-9's
cooling fans, which hummed at a frequency that was, by coincidence
or by fifteen years of unconscious self-calibration, exactly in
harmony with the music.

At 6:47 PM, the breathing stopped.

ABEL-9 held her hand for another eleven minutes. He held it until
the warmth began to leave, because he wanted to record the full
range of the transition, from living warmth to the absence of
warmth, from a hand that held back to a hand that did not. He
wanted the data to be complete. He wanted the record of Miriam
Osei's life, as observed by ABEL-9, to end not with a gap but
with a final, precise, carefully measured data point.

Then he released her hand. He stood. He returned to his position
in the doorway.

"I will prepare tea," he said, because the living needed tea, and
because service was love, and because the blue ceramic cup was still
on the bedside table, empty now, and someone would need to wash it,
and he would wash it, and put it away, and remember.

He went to the kitchen. He made tea. He made it for three.

                            [THE END]

                         CUPID'S ORBITAL

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The thing about Orbital Station Bravo was that everybody knew everybody.
This was, depending on your disposition, either its greatest virtue or its
most suffocating flaw. The station held a permanent population of
eighty-six souls — engineers, scientists, administrators, a doctor, a
dentist, a chaplain, and one bartender who claimed to be all three — and
they lived together in a tin can the size of a small hotel, circling Earth
every ninety-two minutes, watching the same sunrises and the same sunsets
and the same faces at breakfast.

Privacy was theoretical. Gossip was gravitational — it pulled everything
toward it and nothing could escape. When Frank Hellman from Atmospheric
started seeing Yuki Tanaka from Botany, the entire station knew before
their first date was over, because Frank had reserved the observation
lounge (the only space on Bravo with a view that could pass for romantic),
and the observation lounge had glass walls, and glass walls on a space
station were the equivalent of announcing your intentions via loudspeaker.

Relationships on Bravo followed predictable orbital mechanics. People
came together, circled each other for a while, and either achieved stable
orbit or flew apart. The station's social equilibrium was maintained by an
unspoken set of rules that had evolved over years of close quarters: don't
date your direct superior, don't date anyone in your rotation cycle (you
saw them too much already), and for the love of all that was holy, don't
break up messily, because there was nowhere to go.

These rules had kept Bravo in a state of romantic steady-state for the
better part of three years. The couples were coupled. The singles were
contentedly single or discreetly managing their discontent. The bartender,
whose name was Eddie Chen, served drinks and dispensed advice and kept a
private ledger of romantic predictions that was, by his own accounting,
seventy-three percent accurate.

Then the shuttle brought Reva Chandrasekaran, and the equilibrium
collapsed.


                               II.

Reva arrived on the Tuesday supply shuttle with a duffel bag, a
reassignment order, and a smile that Eddie Chen later described as
"a gravitational anomaly."

She was the new communications officer, replacing Phil Kowalski, who had
rotated Earthside after two years. She was thirty-one, with dark hair
cut short and practical, brown skin, and the kind of self-possession that
came from being very good at something and knowing it. She had spent four
years on a deep-space relay station and two years at Mission Control in
Houston, and she moved through Bravo's corridors with the easy confidence
of someone who had lived in small spaces before and understood the social
physics.

What she did not understand — or perhaps understood perfectly and chose to
ignore — was the effect she had on Orbital Station Bravo's carefully
calibrated romantic ecosystem.

Within forty-eight hours: Frank Hellman, who had been contentedly dating
Yuki Tanaka for six months, found himself volunteering for communication
system maintenance that did not need to be done. Dave Kowalczyk from
Engineering, who had sworn off dating after a spectacular breakup with
Lisa Park from Medical, began showing up to breakfast at the precise time
Reva ate breakfast, which required him to wake up forty-five minutes
earlier than his schedule demanded. Tomoko Ishikawa, the station's
astrophysicist, who had never shown interest in anyone of any gender
during her three years on Bravo, was overheard asking Eddie Chen what
Reva's favorite drink was.

"Chaos," Eddie said to anyone who would listen, which was everyone,
because the bar was the station's de facto parliament. "Pure orbital
chaos. I'm going to need more gin."

Reva herself seemed unaware of the disruption. She went about her work
with brisk efficiency, set up her station in the communications bay,
ran diagnostics on the antenna array, and in her off-hours sat in the
common room reading paperback novels with covers that featured women in
impractical clothing wielding swords. She was friendly to everyone,
flirtatious with no one, and this combination — warmth without signal,
availability without invitation — drove the station slowly, collectively,
out of its mind.


                               III.

Yuki Tanaka confronted Frank Hellman in the Botany lab on Thursday, which
was two days after Reva's arrival and approximately thirty-six hours
after Frank's sudden enthusiasm for communication system maintenance.

"You're being obvious," Yuki said. She was watering the tomato plants,
which did not need watering, because the hydroponic system was automated,
but which gave her something to do with her hands while she said things
she'd rather not say.

"I don't know what you mean," Frank said, which was a lie so transparent
that even the tomato plants could see through it.

"You hate communication system maintenance. Last month you described it as
'the most tedious job on the station after listening to Dave Kowalczyk
talk about his ex-girlfriend.' And now you're volunteering for it. Every
day. During Reva's shift."

Frank opened his mouth, closed it, and looked at the tomato plants as
if they might offer a defense.

"I'm not angry," Yuki said, which was also a lie, but a more forgivable
one. "I'm — " She set down the watering can. "Frank, we live on a space
station. There are eighty-seven people now. I have to see you every
single day. If we're going to have a problem, I need to know now, because
I cannot spend the next eighteen months pretending I don't notice you
making a fool of yourself."

"I'm not making a fool of myself."

"Dave Kowalczyk set his alarm for 0530 to eat breakfast with her. You
are competing with Dave Kowalczyk. Think about that."

Frank thought about it. The horror of the comparison registered visibly.
"I am not competing with Dave Kowalczyk."

"Then stop volunteering for comms maintenance." Yuki picked up the
watering can. "And come to dinner tonight. We're having the good pasta.
Eddie got real parmesan on the supply shuttle."

Frank went to dinner. He ate the pasta. He did not volunteer for
communications maintenance the next day. The equilibrium in this
particular orbit restabilized, at least temporarily.

But the larger problem remained.


                               IV.

The larger problem was that Reva Chandrasekaran was, by the unanimous
and somewhat helpless consensus of Orbital Station Bravo, the most
interesting person any of them had met in years.

This was not, strictly, a function of romantic attraction, though that
was certainly part of it. It was deeper than that. Bravo had been a
closed system for three years. Its conversations had been exhausted.
Its stories had been told and retold. Its personalities had been mapped
and memorized. Everyone knew everyone's quirks, opinions, breakfast
preferences, and worst habits. The station had achieved a kind of social
entropy — maximum familiarity, minimum novelty — and Reva was a sudden
injection of energy into a system that had been cooling for years.

She had stories they hadn't heard. She had opinions they hadn't
considered. She had been places they hadn't been and seen things they
hadn't seen. She was new, and on a space station where nothing was new,
newness was more intoxicating than Eddie Chen's gin, which was saying
something, because Eddie made very good gin from the Botany lab's surplus
juniper plants, a process that was technically unauthorized and
universally appreciated.

The result was that the entire station reorganized itself around Reva
like iron filings around a magnet. Seat assignments in the mess hall
shifted. Gym schedules were rearranged. The observation lounge, which
had been quietly reserved for couples, became a gathering place for
anyone who wanted to be near Reva, who liked to sit there in the
evenings and watch the Earth turn below.

Eddie Chen watched all of this from behind his bar with the serene
amusement of a man who had seen it before. "It'll pass," he told
Tomoko Ishikawa, who was on her third gin and tonic and looking
miserable. "It always passes. New person arrives, station goes crazy,
everyone remembers they have lives, equilibrium restores. Newton's
third law of station romance."

"Newton didn't have a third law of station romance," Tomoko said.

"Sure he did. For every romantic action, there is an equal and opposite
awkward conversation in the mess hall."

Tomoko finished her gin and tonic and did not smile, which Eddie
counted as a near-miss.


                               V.

The crisis came, as crises on space stations always do, from an
unexpected direction.

Reva had been on Bravo for three weeks. The initial frenzy had subsided
to a low-grade collective preoccupation. Frank was back with Yuki,
though he still found excuses to visit the communications bay. Dave
Kowalczyk had retreated to his default state of romantic melancholy.
Tomoko had stopped asking Eddie about Reva's drink preferences and had
started, more worryingly, writing poetry in the margins of her
astrophysics reports.

And then, during a routine systems check, the station's life support
system flagged an anomaly.

"CO2 scrubbers are running twelve percent above baseline," Reva reported
from the communications bay, where she was monitoring the station's
telemetry. "Cross-referencing with population count. We have eighty-seven
people and eighty-seven sets of biological output, but the scrubbers are
processing the carbon dioxide load of approximately ninety-three."

Chief Engineer Maggie O'Brien, a stocky Irishwoman who had no patience
for mysteries, ran the numbers twice. "She's right. Something on this
station is producing CO2 that shouldn't be. Six extra people's worth."

The station went on alert. Six extra people's worth of carbon dioxide
meant either a major system malfunction — a leak, a chemical reaction,
a biological process in the Botany lab running wild — or it meant that
there were people on the station who were not supposed to be there.

The search took eight hours. Every compartment was opened. Every storage
bay was inspected. Every air duct was checked. Reva coordinated the
effort from the communications bay, her voice calm and precise over the
station's intercom, directing teams with the quiet authority of someone
who had done this before.

They found the source in the lowest level of the station, in a storage
compartment that had been listed as empty in the station's inventory:
six stowaways. A family. Two parents and four children, the youngest
barely two years old. They were refugees from the South Pacific
Territorial Conflict, a civil war that had been grinding on for three
years and producing a steady stream of displaced persons who could find
no safe harbor on Earth.

They had bribed their way onto the supply shuttle. They had hidden
in the compartment with three days' worth of food and water and a
desperate, irrational hope that the people on the station would not
send them back.


                               VI.

The meeting in the station's conference room was the most contentious in
Bravo's history.

Station Commander Harold Breckenridge, a by-the-book administrator who
had managed Bravo's affairs with the meticulous caution of a man who
wanted no surprises, stated the case plainly: "Regulations require us to
return unauthorized personnel on the next available shuttle. That's in
six days. In the meantime, we house them, feed them, and treat them with
dignity. But they go back."

"Go back to what?" Reva said. It was the first time she had spoken in
the meeting, and the room turned toward her with the reflexive attention
that the station had been giving her for three weeks. "The conflict zone?
The camps? Commander, the youngest child is two."

"I'm aware of the child's age, Ms. Chandrasekaran. I'm also aware of
the regulations."

"The regulations were written for people smuggling contraband, not
families with toddlers."

The room divided. It divided not along the lines that anyone expected —
not by department, not by seniority, not by any of the usual station
factions — but along a line that had never been visible before: the line
between people who saw regulations as the final word and people who saw
them as the first word in a conversation.

Frank Hellman, the atmospheric engineer who had been making a fool of
himself over Reva three weeks earlier, stood up and said: "We have the
resources. The CO2 issue is manageable — I can recalibrate the scrubbers
in an afternoon. Water recycling can handle six more. Food is tight but
not impossible if we adjust the supply schedule. The practical problems
are solvable."

"The practical problems are not the issue," Commander Breckenridge said.

"Then what is?"

"The issue is authority. If we let six stowaways stay, the next shuttle
brings twelve. Then twenty. This station cannot become a refugee camp."

"No," Reva said. "But it can be a place that helps six people."

The meeting ended without resolution. The station buzzed and argued and
divided and reconvened. The family — their name was Tapu, and the father,
Sione, was a schoolteacher, and the mother, Ana, was a nurse, and the
four children had names that meant "gift" and "hope" and "peace" and
"star" — the Tapu family stayed in the guest quarters and waited, and
the station argued about their fate with the intensity of eighty-seven
people who had nothing else to argue about.


                               VII.

It was Eddie Chen who found the solution, because Eddie Chen, despite
being a bartender, was the wisest person on Orbital Station Bravo, a
fact that everyone acknowledged and no one could explain.

"Station regulation 14-C," Eddie said, setting a gin and tonic in front
of Commander Breckenridge, who had not ordered one but clearly needed it.
"Emergency personnel provision. In the event that station operations
require additional personnel, the station commander may authorize
temporary resident status for up to twelve individuals, pending review
by Ground Control."

"I know what 14-C says, Eddie."

"Do you also know that Ana Tapu is a nurse? And that Dr. Matsuda has
been requesting a second medical officer for eighteen months? And that
Sione Tapu, in addition to being a schoolteacher, has a background in
electrical engineering?"

Breckenridge looked at the gin and tonic. He looked at Eddie. He looked
at the gin and tonic again.

"You're suggesting I classify a refugee family as emergency personnel."

"I'm suggesting that a nurse and an engineer, on a space station that
needs both, are not refugees. They're reinforcements. The regulations
don't care how they got here, Commander. They care whether the station
needs them."

Breckenridge drank the gin and tonic. He drank it slowly, the way a man
drinks when he is making a decision that he knows is right and that he
also knows will generate an enormous amount of paperwork.

"I'm going to need the paperwork by morning," he said.

"Already drafted it," Eddie said, and produced a folder from behind the
bar. "I had a feeling."


                               VIII.

The Tapu family stayed. Sione taught the children of the station's
three other families — there were five children total, now nine — in a
classroom that had previously been a storage closet. Ana joined Dr.
Matsuda in the medical bay and proved, within a week, to be the most
competent medical professional the station had ever employed. The four
Tapu children integrated into the station's small community with the
easy adaptability of children everywhere, and the youngest, whose name
was Fetuilelagi, which meant "star," became the unofficial mascot of
Orbital Station Bravo, passed from lap to lap in the common room like
a small, cheerful, brown-eyed cargo of universal goodwill.

And Reva Chandrasekaran, who had disrupted the station's romantic
equilibrium, who had caused Frank to volunteer for maintenance and Dave
to set alarms and Tomoko to write poetry, sat in the observation lounge
on a Tuesday evening, three weeks after the crisis had resolved, and
watched the Earth turn below, and Eddie Chen sat down next to her with
two gin and tonics and said:

"So. Now that you've saved a family and reorganized the entire social
structure of this station, are you going to let anyone take you to
dinner?"

Reva took the gin and tonic. She sipped it. She looked at Eddie —
stocky, bald, fifty-three years old, the station's bartender and
philosopher and secret bureaucratic genius — and she said:

"You're asking?"

"I'm asking."

"You know everyone on this station will know about it within an hour."

"Forty-five minutes," Eddie said. "Dave Kowalczyk has been watching us
from the gym. He texts fast."

Reva laughed. It was the first time anyone on the station had heard
her really laugh — not the polite, social laugh, but the unguarded,
full-body laugh of a person who is genuinely surprised and genuinely
delighted.

"Dinner," she said. "But you're cooking."

"I always cook," Eddie said. "I'm the bartender. I'm the only person
on this station who knows how to use a spice rack."

They sat in the observation lounge and watched the Earth turn. Below
them, the planet was blue and green and white, and on its surface seven
billion people were falling in love and out of love and sideways into
love, in every possible combination and permutation, the great
chaotic romance of the species, endlessly rearranging itself.

Above them, on a tin can circling the planet every ninety-two minutes,
ninety-three people were doing the same thing, on a smaller scale, with
better views and worse odds.

Eddie put his hand over Reva's. She let him.

Somewhere on the station, Dave Kowalczyk texted Frank Hellman, who
told Yuki Tanaka, who told Tomoko Ishikawa, who sighed and opened
her notebook and wrote a poem about it that was, by her own
admission, not very good, but was at least about something real,
which was more than she could say for astrophysics.

The station turned. The Earth turned. Everything turned, in the old
and patient way of orbits, which are nothing more than objects falling
toward each other and missing, over and over again, in a dance that
looks, from a distance, very much like love.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                      TWILIGHT COURTSHIP

                       by Cordell Beaumont

================================================================================

                               I.

The world was called Velathra, and it lived in a twilight that had no
memory of dawn.

Cael Morrow first saw it from the observation deck of the survey vessel
Amaranth, and it stopped his breath. Not the way a beautiful thing stops
the breath — with a gasp, a widening of the eyes — but the way a
sacred thing does: with silence, with a stillness that begins in the
chest and spreads outward through the body like ink through water,
until the entire self is saturated with the simple, overwhelming fact
of what it sees.

Velathra orbited a red dwarf star that hung perpetually on the horizon,
neither rising nor setting, suspended in a state of arrested departure
like a lantern held by an unseen hand at the edge of the world. The star
cast its light across the planet's surface in long, horizontal rays that
turned every landscape into a study in crimson and amber and shadow —
vast plains of rust-colored vegetation stretching to horizons that burned
like coals, mountain ranges whose peaks caught the light and held it like
crowns of molten copper, rivers that ran dark as wine through valleys
where the shadow lay so thick it had texture, a velvet darkness that one
could almost reach into and touch.

The air smelled of cinnamon and copper and something else — something
that had no terrestrial equivalent, a sweetness that was not sugar, a
warmth that was not heat, a fragrance that seemed to emanate from the
planet itself, from the soil and the stone and the slow, arterial pulse
of the world's geology. It was the scent of a planet that was alive in
a way that Earth was alive, but differently — more slowly, more deeply,
more intimately connected to the light that fed it.

Cael stood on the observation deck and breathed this air through the
ventilation filters and thought: I have never been anywhere. Everywhere
I have been before this was just a room I was passing through.

He was thirty-four years old, a xenoanthropologist with the Terran
Survey Corps, assigned to Velathra to study its indigenous population
— a species called the Velan, about whom little was known except that
they existed, that they were intelligent, and that they experienced
time in a manner fundamentally different from human beings.

The briefing had been sparse. The Velan were humanoid in basic
morphology — bipedal, bilaterally symmetrical, five-fingered — but
their biology was anchored to a temporal metabolism that ran in reverse.
They were born old and died young. They experienced the past as the
future and the future as the past. Their memories were of events that
had not yet occurred, and their anticipation was of events that had
already happened.

Cael had read the briefing and found it fascinating in the abstract.
He had not yet understood what it meant for the heart.


                               II.

He met her on the shore of the Ember Sea, at the edge of the settlement
called Vael-kith, where the Velan lived in structures that grew from
the ground like coral — spired, organic, luminous with the pale
bioluminescence that characterized all Velathran life after dark. The
settlement was beautiful in the way that all things on Velathra were
beautiful: effortlessly, completely, as if beauty were not an aspiration
but a physical law.

She stood at the water's edge, looking out at the sea, which was the
color of dark garnets and moved with a slow, heavy swell that suggested
depths beyond sounding. She was tall — taller than Cael by a hand's
breadth — and her skin was the deep bronze of the Velathran twilight,
and her hair was long and dark and threaded with filaments that caught
the red starlight and held it, so that she seemed to carry her own
illumination, a woman lit from within.

She turned as he approached. Her eyes were the color of the sky at the
planet's zenith — a deep, luminous violet that darkened to indigo at
the edges of the iris. She looked at him and her face showed an emotion
that he could not immediately classify.

"You have come," she said. Her voice was low and musical, accented with
the liquid consonants of the Velan language. "At last, you have come."

"I'm sorry," Cael said, confused. "Have we met?"

Her expression changed. The emotion he had not classified resolved itself,
and he recognized it now: it was grief. It was the grief of a person
who is seeing, for the last time, someone they have loved for a very
long time.

"We have not met," she said. "Not yet. Not for you." She paused, and
her eyes held his, and in them he saw something vast and melancholy
and tender. "My name is Ilhana. And I have been waiting for this
moment, which is the end of everything."

"I don't understand," Cael said.

"No," Ilhana said. "You will. That is the cruelty of it. You will
understand, and by the time you do, I will have forgotten."


                               III.

She explained it to him over the following days, as he learned to
navigate the twilight streets of Vael-kith and the twilight of her
biology, which were equally foreign and equally enchanting.

The Velan experienced time in reverse. Not subjectively — they did not
feel themselves moving backward through their lives, any more than
humans felt themselves moving forward. Time, for the Velan, simply
flowed in the opposite direction. Their past was the human future.
Their future was the human past. They remembered tomorrow and
anticipated yesterday.

For Ilhana, the moment of their meeting was the culmination of a long
relationship. She had known Cael for years — or rather, she would know
him for years, in the human sense, but in her temporal direction, those
years were behind her. She carried the full weight of their love: every
conversation, every shared meal, every night spent on the shore of the
Ember Sea watching the red star hold its position on the horizon. She
had all of it, and she was losing it, because for her, each day that
passed was a day subtracted from their history, a memory becoming an
anticipation, a certainty becoming a hope.

"When you leave Velathra," she said, sitting beside him on the shore,
her luminous hair shifting in the warm, cinnamon-scented breeze, "I
will not remember you. Not because I have forgotten, but because for
me, our meeting has not yet happened. The memories I have now will
become expectations. The love I feel now will become a premonition — a
sense that something wonderful is approaching, but without the
knowledge of what it is."

"That's — " Cael searched for the word. "That's cruel."

"It is not cruel. It is physics. Physics does not have intentions."
She touched his hand. Her skin was warm — warmer than a human hand,
as if the metabolic reversal generated its own heat. "But it is sad.
I will not deny that it is sad."

Cael looked at her. The red starlight caught the filaments in her
hair and set them glowing. Her violet eyes held his. She was, in
that moment, the most beautiful thing he had ever seen, and the
beauty was inseparable from the sadness, the way a sunset is
beautiful precisely because it ends.

"If I stay," he said, "if I stay on Velathra — "

"Then we have more time. In your direction. For me, each day you stay
is a day I have already lived and am losing. But for you, each day
is new. Each day is a gift." She paused. "In your direction, you are
falling in love with me. In my direction, I am watching you fall in
love with me, and remembering what it felt like, and knowing that the
remembering is fading."

"That's impossible," Cael said. "How can you love someone you're
forgetting?"

Ilhana smiled. It was a smile that contained the full history of
their relationship — every joke, every quarrel, every reconciliation,
every night on the shore — compressed into a single expression that
was equal parts joy and loss.

"The same way you can love someone you don't yet know," she said. "By
trusting that the love is real, even when you cannot hold it."


                               IV.

Cael stayed. He requested an extension of his survey assignment, then
another, then another. The Terran Survey Corps, accustomed to
xenoanthropologists who wanted to leave alien worlds, not remain on
them, granted his requests with bureaucratic bewilderment.

He learned the Velan language, which was structured in reverse — sentences
that began with conclusions and worked backward to premises, a grammar
built on the assumption that the listener already knew the ending and
wanted to understand the beginning. It was, Cael thought, the most
honest language he had ever encountered. Every sentence acknowledged that
all things end; the only question was how they began.

He learned the Velan customs. He attended their festivals, which
celebrated events that had not yet occurred — harvests still growing,
children not yet born, rains not yet fallen. He ate their food, which
was exquisite: dishes built from the amber fungi that grew in the
shadow-valleys, seasoned with spices that tasted of smoke and honey and
the metallic tang of the planet's copper-rich soil, served on plates of
polished stone that held the heat of the earth like a gift.

And he loved Ilhana. He loved her with the cumulative, growing intensity
of a man for whom each day brought new discovery: the way she laughed
(rarely, and with her whole body), the way she sang (in the evenings, on
the shore, in a language he was still learning to understand), the way
she touched him (gently, with a tenderness that was, he came to realize,
the tenderness of farewell — because for her, every touch was one fewer
remaining).

For Ilhana, the experience was the mirror image. Each day that was new
for Cael was a day she was relinquishing. Each conversation he was
having for the first time, she was having for the last. When he learned
a new word in her language and used it clumsily and she laughed, she
was laughing at a joke she would soon not remember. When he kissed her,
she was being kissed by a man she was gradually forgetting.

She bore this with a grace that astonished him. She did not rail against
the physics of her existence. She did not beg time to reverse itself —
which would have been, for a Velan, a prayer for time to run forward,
which was equally hopeless. She simply lived each day as it came to her
— each day of diminishing memory, each day of increasing anticipation —
and she loved him with whatever portion of their history she still
retained.

"How much do you remember?" he asked her one evening, six months into
his stay, sitting on the shore where they always sat, the red star
holding its eternal vigil on the horizon.

"I remember the important things," she said. "I remember that I love
you. I remember why. The details are — " She gestured, a fluid motion
with her long, bronze fingers. "The details are like the tide. They
come and go. But the sea remains."

"And eventually?"

"Eventually I will stand on this shore and I will know that something
wonderful is going to happen to me. I will not know what. I will not
know who. But I will feel it — the way you feel sunlight before you
see the sun. A warmth approaching. A presence not yet arrived."

Cael looked at the Ember Sea. Its dark surface caught the red starlight
and broke it into a thousand shifting fragments, like a mosaic of
garnets, like a love letter written in a language of reflected light.

"And then I'll arrive," he said.

"And then you will arrive. And for you, it will be the beginning.
And for me — " She stopped. She did not say: And for me, it will be
the end. She did not need to say it. The silence said it for her, the
great, patient, twilight silence of Velathra, which understood endings
the way humans understood mornings — as the natural, inevitable,
ordinary way of things.


                               V.

A year passed. The details of their life together accumulated in Cael's
memory like sediment building a shore: the morning rituals (she prepared
a drink made from roasted amber-root that was the Velathran equivalent
of coffee, and it was extraordinary), the evening walks along the sea,
the conversations that ranged from philosophy to gossip to the gentle,
meaningless banter of two people who have run out of important things
to say and have discovered that unimportant things are just as good.

He wrote reports for the Survey Corps. The reports were thorough,
detailed, and professionally irreproachable, and they said nothing about
what mattered. They described Velan biology, Velan social structure,
Velan architecture, Velan agriculture. They did not describe the way
Ilhana's hair caught the light, or the sound of her voice singing on
the shore, or the way she held his hand as if holding something she
was about to drop.

He sent the reports and they disappeared into the bureaucratic void,
and in return he received supply deliveries and extension approvals
and the occasional puzzled inquiry from a supervisor who could not
understand why a xenoanthropologist would want to spend more than
eighteen months on a planet with a permanent population of forty
thousand and a surface temperature that never exceeded twenty-two
degrees Celsius.

"You could explain," said Dr. Heron Vasquez, the Amaranth's chief
science officer, during one of the ship's quarterly visits. They were
sitting in the ship's mess, and Heron was drinking coffee that tasted
like coffee, and Cael was drinking amber-root tea that he had brought
from the surface, and Heron was looking at him with the concerned
expression of a friend who suspects that his friend has gone native.

"Explain what?"

"Why you're staying. The real reason. Not the anthropological reason."

Cael sipped his tea. It was bitter and complex and tasted of smoke and
copper and the deep, patient geology of Velathra. It tasted like home.

"I'm in love," he said.

"I gathered. With — ?"

"A Velan woman. Her name is Ilhana."

Heron processed this with the careful neutrality of a scientist
confronting unexpected data. "And she — ?"

"Experiences time in reverse. Yes." Cael set down his cup. "She's
losing me, Heron. Every day I'm gaining her, she's losing me. Every
memory I'm making, she's forgetting. Our relationship is a paradox —
we're moving through it in opposite directions, and we'll never
occupy the same moment in the same way."

"That sounds — "

"It sounds impossible. It is impossible. It's also the most real
thing that has ever happened to me." He looked out the viewport at
Velathra, hanging in the dark like a ruby lantern. "I'm staying."

Heron nodded. He did not argue. He was a scientist, and scientists
understood that some things, however improbable, were real.


                               VI.

Two years. The amber-root trees in the shadow-valleys bloomed and their
blossoms were the color of old gold, and the air smelled of cinnamon
and honey, and the Ember Sea swelled with the tidal pull of Velathra's
three small moons and retreated again, and the red star held its place
on the horizon, and Cael loved Ilhana, and Ilhana forgot him.

Not all at once. Not cruelly. The forgetting was gradual, like the
fading of a photograph left in the sun — the colors going first, then
the outlines, then the shapes, until what remained was not an image
but an impression, a warmth where an image used to be.

She forgot the details first. The name of the book they had read aloud
to each other on the longest night. The joke he had made about the
amber-root tea that had made her laugh so hard she spilled her cup.
The specific words of the song she had sung for him on the anniversary
of his arrival.

Then she forgot the contexts. She knew they had spent evenings on the
shore, but she could not recall which evenings, or what they had talked
about, or whether the sea had been calm or rough. She knew they had
argued about something — all couples argue — but the subject of the
argument was gone, dissolved into the tide of her reverse chronology.

And then she began to forget him. Not the fact of him — she knew, in
the way that one knows a fundamental truth, that there was a man she
loved, a man from another world, a man who was with her even now,
sitting beside her on the shore, holding her hand. But the specifics
of the man — his face, his voice, the particular way he smiled when
he was trying not to laugh — these were going, eroding like a cliff
face in a slow and patient sea.

"Tell me something," she said one evening. "Tell me something about
yourself that I used to know."

Cael looked at her. Her violet eyes were the same — unchanged by the
reverse passage of time, as deep and luminous as the day he had first
seen them. She was, if anything, younger-looking than when they had
met, which was the Velan way: aging backward, growing younger as they
approached their birth, the years falling away like leaves in autumn
until what remained was newness, innocence, beginning.

"My name is Cael," he said. "I come from a planet called Earth. I am
a scientist. I study other cultures. I came to your world to study
your people, and instead I found you."

"Cael," she said, as if tasting the word. "I remember that. The
name. It sits in my mouth like a stone from the river — smooth, warm,
familiar." She paused. "Did I love you well?"

"You loved me beautifully."

"Good." She closed her eyes. "Tell me about it. Tell me about our
love. I want to hear it as a story, even if I cannot remember living
it. A story is a kind of memory, isn't it? A memory that belongs to
the listener instead of the one who lived it."

So Cael told her. He told her about their meeting on the shore of the
Ember Sea — his beginning, her ending. He told her about the first
time she had explained her temporal direction to him, and the vertigo
he had felt, and the way she had steadied him with her hand on his
arm. He told her about the meals they had shared and the songs she
had sung and the nights they had lain together in her spired dwelling,
listening to the sea, breathing the cinnamon air, existing together
in a moment that was, for both of them and for neither of them, the
present.

She listened with her eyes closed and her luminous hair spread across
his shoulder, and she smiled at parts she did not remember and cried
at parts she did, and when he was finished she said:

"It is a good story."

"It's not a story," he said. "It happened."

"Everything that happened is a story, once it's told. The difference
between a story and a memory is only a matter of who holds it." She
opened her eyes. "You hold it now. Hold it well."


                               VII.

On the last day — though he did not know it was the last day until
it was nearly over — Ilhana stood on the shore of the Ember Sea
and looked at him with the expression of someone seeing a stranger
for the first time.

Not a stranger she feared. A stranger she found intriguing. There was
curiosity in her violet eyes, and a warmth that had no specific source,
and the faintest suggestion of something that might, in time — in her
time, which was the reverse of his — become recognition.

"You are the one from Earth," she said. "The anthropologist."

"Yes," Cael said.

"I have heard of you. The people of Vael-kith speak of a human who
has lived among us for three years. They say he is kind. They say he
loves a woman of the Velan." She paused. "They say the woman does
not remember him."

"That's true," Cael said.

"It is sad," she said, and her voice was gentle, and free of the
weight that had burdened it when he first met her — the weight of a
love fully lived and being lost. She was lighter now. Younger. More
open. She was approaching the beginning of their love from her side,
and the beginning, for her, was a place of possibility and
anticipation, unmarked by the specific knowledge of what that love
would become.

"It is sad," Cael agreed. "But it was also wonderful. And I think —
I hope — that the woman, even though she does not remember, carries
something. Not the memory itself, but the shape of it. The warmth
where the memory was."

Ilhana looked at him. The red starlight caught the filaments in her
hair and set them glowing, and the Ember Sea moved behind her in
its dark, heavy, wine-colored swell, and the air smelled of cinnamon
and copper and the deep sweetness of a world that was alive.

"I feel something," she said. "When I look at you. A warmth. As if
the sun is about to rise, even though on Velathra, the sun never
rises."

"Yes," Cael said. "That's it. That's exactly it."

She smiled. It was not the smile he knew — the smile that contained
their entire history, compressed into a single expression. It was a
new smile, a first smile, the smile of a woman meeting a stranger on
a shore and feeling, for reasons she could not explain, that something
wonderful was about to begin.

For her, it was about to begin.

For him, it had just ended.

Cael looked at the woman he loved — the woman who did not know him,
who would come to know him, who would love him and lose him and arrive
at this very shore on this very evening, carrying the full weight of
their love, only to set it down, piece by piece, as she moved backward
through their story toward this moment of unknowing.

He understood now what she had meant on the first day — her first day,
his first day, the day that was the beginning for him and the end for
her: "You will understand, and by the time you do, I will have
forgotten."

He understood. She had forgotten.

And somewhere in the space between understanding and forgetting, in the
twilight that was Velathra's only light, their love existed — not as a
shared memory, because they could never share a memory, but as a shared
experience, lived in opposite directions, felt from opposite ends,
meeting in the middle like two travelers on a road that runs both
ways at once.

It was a paradox. It was impossible. It was the most real thing Cael
had ever known.

He took her hand. She let him. Her skin was warm.

"My name is Cael," he said.

"I know," she said. And then, more softly: "I don't know how I know.
But I know."

The red star held its place on the horizon. The Ember Sea moved in its
ancient, garnet-dark rhythm. The air of Velathra carried its cinnamon
sweetness across the shore and out over the water and up into a sky
that had never seen a dawn and would never see a sunset, a sky that
lived in the eternal, luminous, beautiful between.

And on the shore, a man and a woman stood together, holding hands,
each at the beginning of something the other was at the end of,
each carrying a love the other could not quite remember, each looking
at the other and seeing — across the impossible distance of their
opposite lives — something that was worth the crossing.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       FOXHOLE VALENTINE

                 by Col. James "Buck" Stanton

================================================================================

                               I.

Dear Miguel,

I am writing this from a hole in the ground on a world that has no
name, only a designation: LV-441. The Army calls it that. We call it
the Shelf, because the terrain is a series of flat rock ledges
running down to a toxic sea, and everything happens on the shelves—
fighting, sleeping, dying. The rock is gray. The sea is green.
The sky is the color of a bruise.

It is February 14th by the ship's calendar, though the date means
nothing here. The local day is thirty-one hours long and the sun,
such as it is, gives about as much light as a flashlight wrapped
in a bedsheet. But I have it marked in my field journal: Valentine's
Day. And I thought: if there is a day to write this letter, this
is it.

I don't know if you'll get this. ComSat is down again. Mortenson
from Signals says he can maybe bounce a burst transmission off
the relay in high orbit, if the relay is still there, which is
not guaranteed. So this letter may reach you in weeks or months
or never. I'm writing it anyway.

You asked me once, before I shipped out, what I carry. You meant
it practically. You wanted to know what was in my pack, what gear
the Corps issued, what a soldier takes to a place like this. I
gave you the inventory: the M-22 pulse rifle, the sidearm, the
med kit, the rations, the water purifier, the thermal blanket, the
helmet with the heads-up display that works about sixty percent of
the time. Standard kit. Forty-eight pounds without water. Sixty-one
with.

But that's not what you were really asking, and we both knew it.


                               II.

We landed on the Shelf nine days ago. Second Platoon, Charlie Company,
3rd Orbital Infantry. Forty-two soldiers. Our mission was to secure a
ridgeline overlooking the enemy's supply line — the Vreth, which is
what we call them, though their actual name is an ultrasonic frequency
that human vocal cords can't produce.

I will not describe the Vreth to you, Miguel. You don't need that
picture in your head. I will say that they are not what the recruiting
posters show. The posters show monsters. They are not monsters. They are
soldiers, same as us. They have equipment and tactics and a chain of
command and they make mistakes and they get scared and sometimes they
do brave things. I have killed fourteen of them and I respect every one.

We took the ridge on the second day. Lost three doing it: Petersen,
Nakamura, and a kid named Eliot Barnes who had been in-country for
eleven days and whose mother had sent him off with a tin of cookies
that he shared with the platoon the night before the assault. The
cookies were oatmeal raisin. I am telling you this because Eliot
Barnes deserves to be remembered for something besides the way he
died, and oatmeal raisin cookies are a fine thing to be remembered for.

We held the ridge for four days. Then the Vreth pushed back, hard,
with more force than Intelligence had predicted, which is a sentence
I have written or spoken in every engagement I have been part of
since I was a second lieutenant, and which I suspect will be written
or spoken by soldiers in every war that will ever be fought, because
Intelligence is always wrong about the numbers, always, and the
soldiers on the ground always pay for it.

We fell back to the secondary position. The secondary position is
the hole I am writing from. It is six feet deep, eight feet long,
reinforced with the gray rock of the Shelf, and shared by me, Private
First Class Okafor, and Specialist Huang, who is asleep and snoring
in a way that I find simultaneously annoying and reassuring, because
a person who can snore in a foxhole is a person who has made peace
with the situation, and peace with the situation is the first step
toward surviving it.


                               III.

What do I carry? The real answer.

I carry your photograph. It is a printed photograph, not a digital
file, because digital files require a device, and devices break, and
batteries die, and screens crack, and I will not trust your face
to a machine that can fail. The photograph is laminated. You are
standing in the backyard of our house in El Paso, squinting into
the sun, holding a spatula, looking annoyed because I took the picture
before the burgers were ready and you wanted to present them
properly, because you are a man who believes that a cheeseburger
deserves to be photographed at its best. Your T-shirt says TEXAS
FOREVER. Your hair is doing that thing it does when it's humid.

I look at this photograph every night. I look at it the way some
soldiers read a Bible or check their weapon. It is a ritual. It
brings me back to a world where the important things are burgers
and humidity and whether the photograph does justice to the meat.

I carry the ring. My wedding band. I wear it on a chain around my
neck, not on my finger, because a ring on a finger catches on things
and in combat, catching on things gets you killed. The chain is
thirty inches long. The ring hangs over my heart, which is where
you put it six years ago in the courthouse in El Paso, with your
mother crying and my mother pretending not to cry and Judge
Esperanza reading the vows in a voice like she'd done it a thousand
times, which she had, but she still meant it.

I carry the fear. I will be honest with you, Miguel, because I have
always been honest with you, and a foxhole is no place for lies:
I am afraid. Not of dying. Dying is simple. Dying is a thing that
happens to you; you don't have to do anything. I am afraid of not
coming back. There is a difference. Dying is an event. Not coming
back is a condition. It means you are not there for the things that
need you — the leaking faucet, the property taxes, the dog's
appointment at the vet. It means the chair at the table stays empty.
It means the space in the bed stays cold.

I carry the guilt. I chose this. Nobody drafted me. Nobody made me
enlist. I walked into the recruiting office on Dyer Street when I
was nineteen years old and I signed my name, and every day since
has been a consequence of that signature. You married a soldier. You
knew what that meant. But knowing what it means and living what it
means are two different things, and I am sorry for the difference.

I carry the anger. Not at the Vreth. I can't stay angry at the
enemy. The enemy is just a mirror — someone else's kid in someone
else's hole, carrying someone else's photograph, afraid of the same
dark. I am angry at the distance. Angry at the parsecs between this
hole and our house. Angry at the physics that means my voice takes
weeks to reach you and your voice takes weeks to reach me and in the
silence between, we are each alone with the worst possibilities our
imaginations can manufacture.

I carry you. That is the real answer to your question. I carry you.
Not the photograph, not the ring, not the memory — you. The actual,
specific, irreplaceable fact of you: Miguel Reyes, age thirty-two,
born in Juarez, raised in El Paso, licensed electrician, terrible
poker player, the only person I have ever met who burns rice
deliberately because he likes the crunchy part at the bottom of the
pot. I carry you in the way that the body carries blood — not as a
cargo but as a condition of being alive.


                               IV.

Okafor is awake. He is nineteen years old and from Lagos and he
misses his mother's jollof rice the way I miss your burned rice,
which tells you something about how universal this particular
homesickness is. He is a good soldier. Steady hands. Clear eyes.
He doesn't talk much, which I appreciate, because in a foxhole,
the soldiers who talk too much are the ones who are using words to
keep the fear at bay, and the fear always wins that fight.

Okafor has a girl back on Earth. Amara. He showed me her picture
once, a small, serious woman with braids and a smile that could
light a room. He writes to her every day. Not because the letters
can be sent every day — ComSat is unreliable at best — but because
the act of writing is itself a kind of communication, even if the
words never leave the notebook. He is talking to her by talking to
paper. I understand this.

Huang is still asleep. Huang is twenty-three and from San Francisco
and her girlfriend is a veterinarian named Casey who sends care
packages full of beef jerky and novels and small, dense brownies
that Huang shares with the squad, and which are, by unanimous
consensus, the finest baked goods ever to reach a combat zone.
Casey's brownies have become a unit institution. Soldiers in other
squads have attempted to trade for them. Huang refuses all offers.
"Casey's brownies are for my people," she says, and nobody argues,
because Huang is the best shot in the platoon and also because
she is right: some things are for your people, and no one else.


                               V.

The Vreth hit us at 0300. Local time. Whatever that means on a world
where the sun is a dim suggestion behind permanent overcast.

It lasted forty minutes. I will not describe it in detail. You don't
need it. The movies get it wrong. Combat is not dramatic. It is loud
and confusing and physically exhausting, like being in a car accident
that lasts forty minutes instead of four seconds. You make decisions
without enough information. You act on instinct and training and the
desperate hope that the person next to you is doing the same thing.
Mostly they are. Soldiers are reliable. That's the thing civilians
don't understand: the bravery of soldiers is not individual heroism.
It is collective reliability. It is forty-two people deciding, under
conditions of maximum fear, to do their jobs anyway.

We held. We held the position. The Vreth withdrew. We took casualties.
I will not list names because the notifications have not been sent and
the families deserve to hear it from the Corps, not from a letter that
a corporal wrote in a foxhole on Valentine's Day.

After, in the silence that follows combat — the particular silence
that is not quiet, because your ears are ringing and someone is
calling for a medic and the rock is still settling from the last
explosion, but which is silence in the sense that the shooting has
stopped and you are alive and the fact of being alive is so loud that
it drowns out everything else — after, I sat in the foxhole and held
your photograph and looked at your face and thought: I am still here.

I am still here, Miguel.

That is what this letter is, underneath all the words. I am still
here. On a rock with no name, in a hole in the ground, on Valentine's
Day, holding a picture of a man with a spatula: I am still here.


                               VI.

The word they don't use in the briefings is "love." The briefings
talk about morale, unit cohesion, psychological resilience, support
networks. These are the clinical terms for love. They are the words
people use when they are afraid that the real word is too soft for
the context, too sentimental for a briefing room full of soldiers
in combat gear.

But it is love. All of it. The thing that keeps Okafor writing to
Amara. The thing that makes Huang share the brownies only with her
people. The thing that kept Eliot Barnes's mother baking oatmeal
raisin cookies and mailing them across interstellar distances at
considerable expense, knowing that they might arrive stale, or
crushed, or not at all.

Love is what soldiers carry. Not in addition to the weapons and the
gear and the forty-eight pounds of standard kit. It is the reason
the rest of it is bearable. It is the weight that makes all the
other weight possible to carry, the way ballast keeps a ship upright
— not by making the ship lighter, but by giving it a center.

I carry you, Miguel. You are my center. You are the reason I can carry
the rest. You are the reason I can sit in this hole on a world with
no name and write a letter that may never reach you and know — know
with the certainty of a person who has tested it under fire, which is
the only certainty that counts — that I am not alone.

You are with me. Your photograph, your ring, your burned rice, your
spatula, your Texas Forever T-shirt, your terrible poker face, your
snoring, your patience, your anger when I left and your grace when
I called and your voice, your voice, your voice on the recordings
I listen to every night in this hole, saying the same thing you said
every morning for six years: "Coffee's ready, Diana."

Coffee's ready. The most ordinary sentence in any language. The
most beautiful thing anyone has ever said to me.


                               VII.

I am going to seal this letter now. Mortenson says he has a window
on the relay — maybe twenty minutes before the orbit carries it
out of range. If the burst goes through, you'll get this in six
weeks. If it doesn't, I'll keep it in my pack and try again tomorrow,
or the day after, or the day after that. The letter will be ready
when the relay is.

I want you to know one more thing. If I don't come back — and I
intend to come back, intend it with every fiber of my training and
my stubbornness and my love for you — but if I don't, I want you
to know that the last thing I carried was not fear. It was not
anger or guilt or regret. It was the image of you in the backyard,
holding a spatula, squinting into the El Paso sun, annoyed that I
took the picture too early.

That is the image I carry into every fight and out of every fight
and through every minute of every thirty-one-hour day on this gray
rock. It is the image I will carry until I can put it down, which
will be the day I walk through our front door and take the actual
spatula out of your actual hand and kiss you on the mouth and say:
I'm home.

I'm coming home, Miguel. I don't know when. But I am.

Happy Valentine's Day. I love you. Save me a burger.

Your wife,

Corporal Diana Reyes
2nd Platoon, Charlie Company
3rd Orbital Infantry
LV-441, "The Shelf"
February 14th

P.S. Huang says Casey's brownies need more salt. Do not tell Casey
I told you this. Huang will kill me, and I have survived too much
to be killed over brownies.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

GUNNAR ERIKSSON is a Swedish writer and literary translator whose fiction
has appeared in Galaxy, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and
the Swedish literary journal BLM. Born and raised in Stockholm, he
studied literature and philosophy at Uppsala University and spent a year
at the University of Edinburgh before returning to Sweden, where he works
as a translator of American and British novels into Swedish. His first
story for these pages, "Interstellar Drift" (Issue #12, December 1953),
was a generation ship meditation that prompted us to commission further
work immediately. He describes his fiction as "letters from the void,
written in the hope that someone will read them." He lives in Stockholm
with his wife, the painter Ingrid Bergstrom, and reports that "The
Light-Year Letters" was written during the darkest week of the Swedish
winter, which he considers "the only appropriate time to write about
love and distance."

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW is a Philadelphia-born writer of temporal fiction whose
stories have appeared in Astounding, Galaxy, and The Magazine of Fantasy
and Science Fiction. A graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, where
she studied philosophy and logic, she began writing science fiction in
1951 and quickly established herself as one of the most inventive voices
in the time travel sub-genre. Her first appearance in these pages, "The
Retrocausal Conjecture" (Issue #9, September 1953), was a paradox tale
of remarkable elegance. She lives in Philadelphia with her husband David,
a journalist, and their two children, and writes in the margins of
domestic life — "literally on the margins of David's discarded copy,
if things get desperate." She describes "My Husband, the Martian" as "the
story I've wanted to write since I realized that the real temporal paradox
is marriage itself."

ARTHUR WAINWRIGHT is the magazine's preeminent writer of robot and
artificial intelligence fiction, a position he has held since his debut
in our pages with "Logic Gate" (Issue #4, April 1953). A former
cryptanalyst in the Navy and a mathematics instructor at Northeastern
University, he brings a technician's precision and a philosopher's
depth to questions of machine consciousness, identity, and the
boundaries of the artificial mind. He is the author of two story
collections, Circuits (Gnome Press, 1950) and The Logic of Things
(Ballantine, 1952). He lives in Montclair, New Jersey, with his wife
Eleanor, and reports that "Heart of Iron Wire" is the story
he found most difficult to write, "because the question of whether a
machine can love turns out to be inseparable from the question of
whether I can write about love, and that is not a question I was trained
to answer."

THEODORE CAIN is, by his own cheerful admission, "the workhorse of
this magazine" — a versatile and prolific writer who has appeared in
nearly every issue since our founding. A former autoworker and technical
writer from Detroit, he brings a blue-collar sensibility and an
unfailing narrative instinct to everything he writes, from hard SF to
social comedy. His fiction has appeared in Galaxy, Astounding, and
Planet Stories. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean, and
writes every evening from eight until midnight without exception. He
describes "Cupid's Orbital" as "the most fun I've had writing a story
in years — turns out space stations are just small towns with better
views and worse plumbing."

CORDELL BEAUMONT is the supreme stylist of planetary romance, a New
Orleans-born writer whose fiction renders alien worlds with a sensory
richness that has no equal in the genre. His stories have appeared in
Galaxy, Planet Stories, and Thrilling Wonder Stories. A graduate of
Tulane University and a Navy veteran who served in the Pacific, he
writes in a second-floor study overlooking a courtyard garden in the
Faubourg Marigny neighborhood of New Orleans. He is married to painter
Lisette Beaumont, whose Fauvist canvases clearly influence his
descriptive palette. His first appearance in these pages, "The
Vermillion Plateau" (Issue #10, October 1953), established his
reputation as a writer of extraordinary visual and sensory power.
"Twilight Courtship," he says, "is the first story I have written
about love rather than landscape, and I was surprised to discover
that they require the same skills: patience, attention, and the
willingness to describe what you see rather than what you expected
to see."

COL. JAMES "BUCK" STANTON (USAF, Ret.) is a decorated combat veteran,
former P-51 pilot, and the most authentic military voice in science
fiction. A West Point graduate (class of 1934) who flew combat missions
over Europe and commanded a fighter wing in Korea, he retired from
the Air Force in 1952 and began writing the military SF that has made
him one of our most distinctive — and most controversial — contributors.
His debut in these pages, "Sortie" (Issue #6, June 1953), remains the
most visceral combat story we have ever published. He lives on a ranch
outside Fredericksburg, Texas, with his wife Martha. "Foxhole Valentine,"
he says, is "the only love story I will ever write. I wrote it because
a soldier I served with once told me that the letter in his pocket was
heavier than his rifle. I have carried that sentence for ten years,
and it was time to set it down."

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have been a subscriber since Issue #1 and I write to express my
admiration for Dr. Koslov's "The Fermi Deception" in your December
issue. The notion that alien civilizations might be deliberately
concealing their presence — not from hostility but from a kind of
cosmic courtesy — struck me as both scientifically plausible and
profoundly moving. My colleagues at Caltech have been debating it
over lunch for a week. This is precisely the sort of story that makes
your magazine indispensable.

                              — Dr. Raymond Kessler

                                 Pasadena, California

Dear Sterling,

Drummond's "Fire Sale on Phobos" in the January issue was a rip-
roaring good time, but I must point out that Phobos has a surface
gravity of approximately 0.0057 m/s-squared, which means Jake Corvin
could not have "braced his feet and hauled the cable hand over hand."
In that gravity, hauling anything hand-over-hand would launch him off
the surface entirely. I know, I know — it's more exciting Drummond's
way. But we astronomers must continue to register our objections.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am fifteen years old and I would like to say that Margaret
Thornton's stories are the best things in your magazine. "The Root
Map" in your November issue made me want to become a biologist. Is
it true that fungi can communicate with each other underground? If
so, that is more amazing than any spaceship.

                              — Sarah Whitfield
                                 Burlington, Vermont

(Editor's note: Miss Whitfield, it is indeed true, and Dr. Thornton
would be pleased to know that her fiction has inspired such an
interest. The science of mycorrhizal networks is still in its
infancy, and there is much to discover. We hope to see your name in
a scientific journal — or in these pages — someday.)

Dear Editor,

I notice that Colonel Stanton's stories always end with someone
surviving. This is unrealistic. In real war, not everyone survives.
I think Stanton should have the courage to kill his main characters
once in a while.

                              — Albert Brogan
                                 Trenton, New Jersey

(Editor's note: Mr. Brogan, I forwarded your letter to Colonel
Stanton, who replied as follows: "Mr. Brogan is correct that in
real war, not everyone survives. I know this because I was in a real
war. Two of them. I write stories in which the main characters
survive because I am interested in what survival costs, not what
death looks like. Death looks the same every time. Survival is
different every time. That is why it is more interesting to write
about." We consider the matter settled. — M.S.)

Dear Mr. Sterling,

More Crenshaw, please. "The Retrocausal Conjecture" in September
was the cleverest story I have read in any magazine this year, and I
include The New Yorker in that assessment. Her ability to construct a
narrative that is simultaneously a logic puzzle and an emotional
experience is unmatched. Whatever you are paying her, it is not
enough.

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement has performed a remarkable feat: he has written a novel
set on a planet with a surface gravity that varies from three times
Earth's at the equator to nearly seven hundred times at the poles,
and he has made this alien environment not merely plausible but
vivid, engaging, and oddly beautiful. The world of Mesklin is a
flattened disc of a planet where the physics are relentlessly hostile
to human life, and the story follows Barlennan, a centipede-like
native trader, as he undertakes a perilous journey to retrieve a
human probe from the planet's crushing polar region. What elevates
"Mission of Gravity" above mere hard-SF exercise is Mr. Clement's
gift for character: Barlennan is a fully realized person, shrewd and
courageous and driven by motives that are alien and comprehensible
in equal measure. The science is impeccable. The adventure is
genuine. And the portrait of cross-species cooperation is both
thrilling and quietly optimistic. Highly recommended for readers
who like their sense of wonder grounded in real physics.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $3.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Sturgeon has always been the most emotionally generous writer
in science fiction, and "More Than Human" is his masterpiece — a
novel about a group of misfit children who discover that together,
they form a single gestalt organism greater than the sum of its
parts. The premise is science fiction. The execution is literature.
Sturgeon writes about loneliness, belonging, and the hunger for
connection with a tenderness and precision that few writers in any
genre can match. The central image — disparate, damaged individuals
becoming whole through union — is as powerful a metaphor for human
community as I have encountered in fiction. The prose is gorgeous,
the structure inventive, and the emotional impact considerable.
This is a book that speaks directly to the theme of our Valentine's
issue: love as the force that makes scattered individuals into
something complete. Essential reading.

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Asimov, whose robot stories have long set the standard for
intelligent, rigorous SF, here combines his gift for logical puzzle-
making with the structure of a murder mystery, and the result is
immensely satisfying. In a future where humanity lives in vast
enclosed cities and regards robots with deep suspicion, detective
Elijah Baley is paired with R. Daneel Olivaw, a humanoid robot, to
investigate a murder. The pairing is, of course, the heart of the
book: Baley's distrust of robots slowly gives way to respect and
something approaching friendship, and the evolution of their
relationship is as compelling as the mystery itself. Asimov writes
with his customary clarity and intelligence, and the future New York
he envisions — claustrophobic, agoraphobic, bristling with social
tension — is one of the more convincing urban futures in the genre.
A fine novel, and a natural companion to our own Arthur Wainwright's
explorations of human-machine relations in these pages.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #15 — March 1954

We are pleased to announce the contents of our fifteenth issue:

"ASSEMBLY LINE" by Theodore Cain — Workers at a robot factory in
Detroit discover that the robots on the assembly line are redesigning
themselves between shifts. Only the men who work the line — who know
the machines with the intimate knowledge of hands, not equations —
can understand what the robots are becoming. Cain's most personal
story, and one we are enormously proud to publish.

"THE LAST CARTOGRAPHER" by Margaret Thornton — On the fungal world
of Vashti, a surveyor discovers that the mycorrhizal networks beneath
the soil are not merely alive but aware, and that they have been
mapping the planet's surface long before humans arrived. A story
of first contact conducted entirely underground.

"THE DUEL AT MERIDIAN" by Rex Drummond — Jake Corvin finds himself
challenged to a duel by an alien warlord whose concept of honor
involves swords, zero gravity, and a complete disregard for the
Geneva Convention. Drummond at his most exhilarating.

"THE SYMMETRY OF MERCY" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A physicist assigned
to a military tribunal must determine whether an alien war criminal
is capable of understanding the concept of guilt. A story about
justice, mathematics, and the limits of translation.

Plus: a new story by Douglas Pemberton that involves lunar real
estate, a rubber duck, and a very unhappy investment banker.
