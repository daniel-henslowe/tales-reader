TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
"State of the Future"
by Maxwell Sterling

================================================================================

Dear Reader,

Twenty issues. I confess I had to count them twice.

When we launched "Tales from the Future and Beyond" in January of 1953,
I told you that a magazine is a conversation. I believed it then, but I
did not yet understand what it meant. Now I do. A conversation is not a
monologue delivered from behind an editor's desk. It is an exchange — a
living, evolving thing that changes both parties. You have changed this
magazine, and if I may be so bold, I believe this magazine has changed
some of you.

In twenty issues, we have published one hundred and seventeen stories by
forty-one different authors. We have traveled to the moons of Jupiter,
the surface of Venus, the edge of the galaxy, and — perhaps most
daringly — into the human heart itself. We have built space stations,
toppled empires, made first contact with alien minds, laughed at the
absurdities of progress, and wept at its costs. We have, in short, done
what science fiction does best: we have imagined the consequences of
being human in a universe that is under no obligation to make that easy.

I want to take a moment to acknowledge the authors who have made this
possible. Some of them are names you know well by now — the regulars who
have appeared in issue after issue, whose fictional worlds have become as
familiar as your own neighborhood. Others have passed through our pages
only once or twice, leaving behind a single story that burned bright and
stayed with you. I am proud of every one of them, and I am deeply
grateful for their trust in this magazine.

I want also to acknowledge you, the reader. Your letters — supportive,
critical, passionate, occasionally irate — have been the compass by
which we have steered. When you told us you wanted more hard science, we
listened. When you demanded stronger characters, we pushed our authors to
deliver. When you wrote in to correct our orbital mechanics (Dr. Fitch,
I am looking at you), we gritted our teeth and were grateful.

For this milestone twentieth issue, I have assembled what I believe is
our most ambitious lineup to date. Hal Mercer brings us the largest
engineering project yet attempted in these pages. Father Aquino delivers
a story of conscience that will haunt you long after you finish it.
Theodore Cain proves once again that there is no premise he cannot make
compelling. Franklin Hoyt holds a mirror to our politics and dares us to
look. Gunnar Eriksson, writing from Stockholm, gives us a meditation on
time and sacrifice that is among the most beautiful things we have
published. And Bob Finley — well, Bob Finley gives us a chase story so
fast you may need to hold the magazine with both hands.

Six stories. Six visions. Twenty issues and counting.

The future, I am pleased to report, is in excellent health.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond
New York, June 1954

                         THE BRIDGE TO FOREVER

                      by Harold "Hal" Mercer

================================================================================

                               I.

The cable had failed at Joint Seventeen.

Rosa Ibarra stood in the observation blister of Orbital Station Promontory
and looked down the length of the bridge — all forty-three kilometers of
it that existed so far — and tried not to think about the six months of
work that Joint Seventeen represented. Through the curved transparency
of the blister, the bridge stretched away from the station like a single
thread drawn taut against the blackness, its carbon nanotube cables
catching the unfiltered sunlight and throwing it back in a hard silver
line that hurt the eyes. At forty-three kilometers out, the bridge
simply stopped. Beyond it, barely visible against the star field, was
the distant glimmer of Orbital Station Abutment, hanging 340 kilometers
away in a slightly higher orbit, waiting to be connected.

Three hundred and forty kilometers. It was an absurd distance for a
physical structure. Everyone said so. The physics review boards said so.
The insurance actuaries said so. Even some of the engineers on her own
team said so, though they had the decency to say it quietly and only
after they had put in their shift hours.

Rosa did not think it was absurd. She thought it was inevitable.

"Chief?" The voice behind her belonged to Deng Wei, her structural
lead, a methodical man from Tianjin who had spent fifteen years building
suspension bridges on Earth before he ever looked up. He floated in the
hatchway, one hand on the frame, a clipboard in the other. Actual paper
on an actual clipboard — Deng did not trust tablets in microgravity,
claiming that floating styluses had cost the space industry more
productive hours than any solar event. "The metallurgy report is back on
Joint Seventeen."

"And?"

"Fatigue fracture. Initiated at the weld seam on the port-side anchor
plate. Propagated through the nanotube matrix over approximately nine
days before catastrophic failure."

Rosa turned from the window. She was a compact woman of fifty-two, with
short gray-streaked hair that she kept clipped close so it would not
float into her eyes, and hands that bore the scars of three decades of
engineering work — two on Earth and one in orbit. Her face was broad and
weathered, her expression one of permanent assessment, as though she
were always calculating load tolerances in her head. Which, in fairness,
she usually was.

"Nine days," she said.

"Nine days. The sensors should have caught it at the two-day mark. They
didn't."

"Why not?"

Deng consulted his clipboard. "The monitoring subsystem for Section
Fifteen through Twenty was operating on reduced sensitivity. The last
firmware update included an optimization routine that widened the
threshold tolerances by twelve percent."

"Who authorized the firmware update?"

"Corporate engineering. Houston office. The memo cited cost efficiency."

Rosa closed her eyes. She had been an engineer long enough to know that
the most dangerous words in the English language were not "hold my beer"
or "what could go wrong" but "cost efficiency." She had been the chief
engineer of the Trans-Orbital Bridge Project for two years, and in that
time she had fought more battles with the corporate board of Meridian
Aerospace than with the actual hostility of the vacuum. Metal fatigue
she understood. Micrometeorite impacts she could plan for. Budget
revisions from people who had never been above the Karman line — those
were the threats that kept her up at night.

"Get me the full chain of authorization on that firmware change," she
said. "And schedule a structural review of every joint from Section
Fifteen to the current terminus. Full sensitivity, original thresholds."

"That'll take three weeks."

"Then we'd better start today."

                              * * *

The Trans-Orbital Bridge was, depending on whom you asked, either the
greatest engineering achievement in human history or the most expensive
folly since the Tower of Babel. The concept was elegant enough: a
physical structure connecting two orbital stations — Promontory and
Abutment — using a framework of carbon nanotube cables under constant
tension, held in alignment by electromagnetic rail systems that allowed
the bridge to flex and adjust as the stations' orbits varied. Cargo,
personnel, and equipment would travel along the bridge in pressurized
cars running on the electromagnetic rails, eliminating the need for
constant shuttle flights between the stations.

The advantages were significant. Shuttle flights consumed fuel — fuel
that had to be hauled up from Earth at enormous expense. The bridge,
once completed, would operate on solar power alone, its rail system
drawing energy from photovoltaic arrays mounted along its length. Over
a ten-year operational window, the cost savings were projected to be
substantial. Over twenty years, transformative. The bridge would not
merely connect two stations; it would demonstrate that permanent
infrastructure could be built in orbit — that space was not merely a
place to visit but a place to stay.

Rosa had been hired because she believed this. More precisely, she had
been hired because she had written a paper proving it was possible, and
then defended that paper against eighteen months of skepticism from
every structural engineer, orbital mechanist, and materials scientist
who could get a seat at the table. The skeptics had legitimate concerns:
thermal cycling would cause the cables to expand and contract constantly,
the orbital mechanics meant the two stations were not stationary relative
to each other, and the micrometeorite environment was orders of magnitude
more hostile than anything a terrestrial bridge had to endure.

Rosa had answers for all of it. The cables were designed with thermal
compensation loops. The electromagnetic rail system provided active
alignment. The outer sheathing incorporated a self-healing polymer layer
that could seal punctures up to three centimeters in diameter within
ninety seconds. She had tested every system in the lab and in small-
scale orbital prototypes, and the numbers held.

The numbers always held. It was the people who wavered.

                               II.

The weekly status call with the corporate board took place every Tuesday
at 0800 UTC, and Rosa dreaded it the way other people dreaded dental
appointments — with a resigned awareness that it would be unpleasant
and a faint hope that it would at least be brief.

She floated in the communications room, tethered to a handhold, facing
a screen that showed seven faces arranged in a grid. Five of them were
board members she had met only as faces on screens — corporate executives
in Houston and New York who understood balance sheets with the same
fluency that Rosa understood stress-strain curves. The sixth was Arthur
Kessler, the Meridian Aerospace CEO, a thin man with silver hair and
the patient expression of someone who was always running numbers in his
head. The seventh was Paul Trask, the project's financial controller,
who served as the board's eyes and ears on the station and whom Rosa
regarded with the wary respect one gives to a competent adversary.

"Ms. Ibarra," Kessler said, with the courtesy that Rosa had learned to
distrust. "We've read your preliminary report on Joint Seventeen. Can
you give us the short version?"

"The short version is that the cable failed because the monitoring system
was running on reduced sensitivity thresholds. The reduced thresholds
were authorized by your Houston engineering office as a cost optimization.
If the sensors had been operating at original specifications, the fatigue
fracture would have been detected seven days before failure. We would
have replaced the anchor plate during a routine maintenance cycle. Total
cost: forty thousand dollars and eight hours of EVA time."

"And the actual cost?"

"The cable section from Joint Fifteen to Joint Twenty-Three is
compromised. We'll need to remove and replace approximately twenty-eight
kilometers of primary cable, along with all associated anchor hardware.
Estimated cost: fourteen million dollars. Estimated time: six months."

There was a silence on the channel. Rosa let it work.

"Ms. Ibarra," said a board member named Garrett, a heavy man whose face
always seemed slightly flushed, even at the low resolution of the video
link. "Are you saying this failure was caused by a firmware update that
our own engineering division approved?"

"I am."

"And you're recommending we spend fourteen million dollars to fix it?"

"I am recommending we spend fourteen million dollars to prevent the
bridge from killing people. Which it will do, reliably and efficiently,
if we run compromised cable under tension at these load factors."

Another silence. Rosa had found, over two years of these calls, that
the truth had a particular sound. It sounded like silence.

"We'll review the numbers," Kessler said. "Paul, can you have a cost
analysis on my desk by Thursday?"

Trask, who had been watching the exchange with the careful neutrality
of a man who understood both sides, nodded. "You'll have it by Wednesday."

The call ended. Rosa untethered herself and floated to the observation
blister. The bridge was still there, still catching the light, still
reaching for a destination it had not yet reached. She put her hand
on the transparency and felt the cold of space through the glass.

Twenty-eight kilometers. Six months. Fourteen million dollars.

She would get it done. She always did.

                              * * *

The replacement work began three days later, after the board approved
the budget with what Rosa suspected were gritted teeth and a revised
quarterly forecast. The first step was to detension the compromised
cables, a process that required a precision that was difficult to
convey to anyone who had not done it. You did not simply "loosen" a
cable that was carrying forty meganewtons of tension across twenty-eight
kilometers of vacuum. You bled the tension off in stages, using the
electromagnetic rail system to transfer the load to adjacent cables,
monitoring the stress distribution across the entire structure in real
time. One wrong calculation, one sensor reading misinterpreted, and
the redistribution could cascade — a failed cable transferring its load
to the next cable, which was not rated for the additional stress, which
then failed and transferred to the next, and so on, in a chain reaction
that could unzip the entire bridge in a matter of minutes.

Rosa supervised the detensioning from the bridge control room, a
cramped space on Promontory Station that was dominated by a bank of
monitors showing structural data from every sensor on the bridge. Deng
ran the numbers. Yuki Tanaka, the electromagnetic systems lead — a
quiet, precise woman from Osaka who had designed mag-lev train systems
before moving to space work — managed the rail adjustments. Kofi Asante,
the EVA team leader — a former deep-sea diver from Ghana who claimed
that space was "just the ocean turned inside out" — coordinated the
outside crews.

They worked in twelve-hour shifts for nine days. The detensioning went
smoothly. Rosa had expected it to go smoothly, because she had planned
it meticulously and because her team was very good. What she had not
expected was the email from Houston that arrived on the fourth day.

It was from Garrett, the flushed board member, and it was addressed not
to Rosa but to Trask, the financial controller. Rosa received it only
because Trask, to his credit, forwarded it to her with a one-word note:
"Heads up."

The email proposed, in the measured language of corporate bureaucracy,
that the replacement cable section use a "revised specification" — a
thinner gauge of nanotube cable that was twenty percent cheaper per
kilometer but had a lower rated tensile strength. The email included
a structural analysis from the Houston engineering office showing that
the thinner cable was "adequate" for the projected load factors "under
normal operating conditions."

Rosa read the email twice. Then she went to the observation blister
and looked at the bridge for a long time. Then she went back to her
desk and composed a reply.

"Mr. Garrett," she wrote. "Thank you for your suggestion regarding the
revised cable specification. I have reviewed the structural analysis
from your Houston office and find it technically accurate under the
assumptions stated, which include steady-state thermal conditions, zero
micrometeorite flux, and stable orbital parameters. I note that none of
these conditions have ever been observed in the actual operating
environment of this bridge for any continuous period exceeding four
hours. The revised cable specification provides a safety margin of 1.3
under best-case conditions. Our project standard, which I set and which
I will not revise, requires a safety margin of 2.0 under worst-case
conditions. I will be using the original cable specification. Regards,
Rosa Ibarra, Chief Engineer."

Trask appeared at her office hatch an hour later. "You know they're not
going to like that."

"They're not going to like it when a bridge car full of people drops
into the atmosphere, either."

Trask studied her for a moment. He was a financial man, but he was not
a fool, and Rosa had come to appreciate the distinction. "For what it's
worth," he said, "I'll back your numbers in the cost report."

"Thank you, Paul."

He pushed off from the hatch frame and floated away down the corridor.
Rosa turned back to her screen. There was work to do.

                               III.

The new cable arrived on the supply shuttle six weeks later — proper
specification, proper gauge, Rosa having won that particular battle
through the simple expedient of refusing to lose it. The installation
crew began work immediately, and for a while, the project settled into
the rhythm that Rosa loved best: the steady, methodical progress of
construction, one joint at a time, one cable section at a time, the
bridge growing longer by measurable increments each day.

She spent most of her time on the bridge itself now, riding out in one
of the pressurized work cars to inspect each new section personally.
The car was a simple thing — a cylindrical cabin mounted on the
electromagnetic rail, with windows on all sides and barely enough room
for four people and their equipment. It hummed as it moved, the
electromagnets gripping the rail with a sound like a sustained bass
note, and the view was extraordinary: the bridge stretching ahead and
behind, the cables converging to a point in both directions, the Earth
below — immense, luminous, indifferent.

Deng usually accompanied her on these inspections, and they had
developed a comfortable working routine: he would read off the sensor
data while she examined the joints and cable interfaces with her own
eyes and hands. Rosa was a believer in instruments — she had designed
half of them herself — but she also believed in the evidence of her
own senses. A joint that looked right was not necessarily sound. But
a joint that looked wrong almost certainly was not.

On the fifty-third day of reconstruction, they were inspecting the
newly installed Joint Nineteen when Deng said, without looking up from
his clipboard: "Chief, we have a problem."

"What kind?"

"Station Abutment has adjusted its orbit. Elevated by two hundred meters
over the last seventy-two hours."

Rosa frowned. The bridge design accommodated orbital variation — the
electromagnetic rail system could handle misalignment of up to five
hundred meters — but unplanned orbital changes introduced complications.
"Why?"

"Abutment station management says they had a close approach from a
debris track and needed to maneuver. Standard collision avoidance."

"Fine. But they need to notify us before they adjust, not after. The
tension calculations for the cable segments we're installing are based
on the station's orbital parameters as of last Monday. A two-hundred-
meter elevation changes the geometry."

"I ran the numbers. The tension differential is within tolerance.
Barely."

"How barely?"

Deng showed her the figures. Rosa studied them. He was right — within
tolerance. But the margin was thinner than she liked, and she had
learned to distrust thin margins the way a sailor distrusts a calm sea.

"Recalculate the tension specs for the next four joints using Abutment's
current position. And send a formal request to Abutment management for
twenty-four-hour advance notification of any orbital adjustment greater
than fifty meters."

"They won't like that."

"Deng, nobody likes anything I ask them to do. That's how I know I'm
doing my job."

                              * * *

The micrometeorite struck on the sixty-first day.

It was a grain of silicate, no larger than a mustard seed, traveling at
fourteen kilometers per second. It hit the bridge at Section Twenty-Two,
punching through the outer sheathing, through the self-healing polymer
layer, through two of the six primary cables, and embedding itself in
the inner structural conduit where it shattered into a spray of
fragments that severed the data line to Joints Twenty-Two through
Twenty-Six.

Rosa was in her quarters when the alarm sounded — a sharp, insistent
tone that meant structural compromise. She was at the control room in
ninety seconds, still pulling on her work coveralls, and found Yuki
already at the rail control station and Kofi suiting up for EVA.

"Status," Rosa said.

"Two primaries severed at Section Twenty-Two," Yuki reported, her voice
flat and precise. "Load redistribution to remaining four cables is
stable but the margin is down to 1.4. Polymer seal deployed but the
puncture was oversized — I'm reading a slow atmosphere leak in the
conduit."

"Data lines?"

"Dead from Twenty-Two to Twenty-Six. We're flying blind on four joints."

Rosa looked at the structural display. The bridge was holding, but it
was holding the way a table holds when you remove one of its legs — by
distributing the stress in ways it was not designed to distribute it.
The safety margin of 1.4 was adequate for the short term, but every hour
that passed without repair increased the fatigue load on the remaining
cables.

"Kofi, get a four-person team out there. Priority one: patch the
sheathing and restore the data lines. Priority two: assess the severed
cables for splice repair. Priority three —"

"Priority three is coffee," Kofi said, pulling on his helmet. "I know
the drill, Chief."

The EVA team was outside within the hour. Rosa watched their helmet-cam
feeds on the control room monitors, the tiny figures of the suited
workers crawling along the bridge structure like ants on a wire,
silhouetted against the blinding white curve of the Earth. They worked
with the efficient choreography of people who had done this many times,
passing tools hand to hand, speaking in the clipped shorthand of EVA
protocol.

The patch took four hours. The data line restoration took six. The
cable assessment took another three, and the news was mixed: one of the
severed cables could be spliced; the other would need to be replaced for
a length of nine hundred meters.

Rosa scheduled the splice for the next day and the replacement for the
following week, when the next supply shuttle could bring up the
necessary cable stock. Then she wrote her report, filed it with the
board, and went back to the observation blister.

The bridge was still there. Damaged, patched, imperfect — but still
there, still reaching across the void.

                               IV.

Three weeks later, Rosa received the call she had been expecting.

Kessler appeared on her screen, alone this time, without the board grid.
His expression was neutral in a way that Rosa recognized as dangerous —
the neutrality of a man who had already made a decision and was now
performing the courtesy of informing her.

"Rosa," he said. "We need to talk about the timeline."

"The timeline is what it is, Arthur. We lost nine days to the
micrometeorite repair. Before that, we lost six weeks to the firmware
failure. We're running four months behind the original schedule, and
I cannot compress the remaining work without compromising safety."

"The board is concerned."

"The board is always concerned. That is, I have come to understand, the
natural state of a board."

A thin smile, quickly suppressed. "The investors are asking difficult
questions. The timeline overrun is creating a narrative — that the
bridge is impractical, that the engineering challenges are
insurmountable, that the project should be wound down and the capital
redirected to conventional shuttle operations."

"And what do you believe?"

Kessler paused. In that pause, Rosa saw something she had not expected:
doubt. Not the corporate doubt that manifested as cost-benefit analyses
and revised quarterly projections, but genuine, personal doubt — the
doubt of a man who had staked his career on a project and was beginning
to wonder if the project was staking back.

"I believe in the bridge," he said carefully. "I also believe in
arithmetic. We have nine months of runway left. If we hit another
significant delay —"

"We will hit another significant delay. We are building a structure
that has never been built before, in an environment that is actively
hostile. There will be delays. There will be failures. There will be
problems I haven't anticipated yet, because they haven't happened yet.
That is the nature of the work."

"Then how do you propose we get it done in nine months?"

Rosa had been thinking about this. She had been thinking about it
during the micrometeorite repair, during the cable replacement, during
the long hours in the observation blister when she watched the bridge
catch the light and throw it back. She had been thinking about it the
way she thought about all engineering problems: by reducing it to its
fundamental constraints and finding the design that satisfied all of
them.

"We work from both ends," she said. "Abutment Station starts building
toward us while we continue building toward them. We double the
construction teams. We pre-fabricate cable sections on the supply
shuttles during transit, so they arrive ready to install instead of
requiring assembly on station. We establish an equipment cache at the
bridge midpoint to reduce transit time for the EVA teams. And we move
to a continuous construction schedule — three shifts around the clock,
no downtime except for mandatory rest periods."

"The cost?"

"Additional personnel and equipment, forty-two million dollars. But the
schedule compresses to seven months instead of twelve."

Kessler looked at her for a long moment. Then he did something that
surprised her: he nodded. "Write it up. I'll present it to the board
myself."

"Arthur."

"Yes?"

"No more firmware optimizations. No revised cable specifications. No
cost efficiencies that compromise the engineering. If I'm going to
build this bridge in seven months, I need to build it right."

Another long moment. "Agreed."

The channel closed. Rosa sat in the communications room for a while,
doing math in her head. Seven months. Two construction fronts. Three
shifts. A midpoint cache.

It could work. The numbers held.

They always did.

                               V.

The bridge met in the middle on the two-hundred-and-ninth day.

Rosa was there when it happened. She was in the work car with Deng and
Yuki and Kofi, riding out along the Promontory side of the bridge to
the leading edge of construction, watching through the forward window
as the cables from both sides converged toward a point that was no
longer theoretical but visible — a cluster of lights against the
starfield that grew steadily larger and resolved, as they approached,
into the work platforms and suited figures of the Abutment construction
crew, building toward them.

The final gap was eleven meters. The last joint — Joint One Hundred and
Seventy-Three, the midpoint — would close it.

The installation took fourteen hours. Rosa supervised every minute,
floating in a suit alongside the EVA crews, checking bolt torques with
her own hands, running her fingers along the cable interfaces to feel
for misalignment. The work was meticulous, painstaking, and profoundly
satisfying — the culmination of two years of planning, eleven months of
construction, and an uncountable number of arguments with people who
had wanted her to build it cheaper, faster, and less well.

At 0347 UTC, Kofi tightened the last bolt on Joint One Hundred and
Seventy-Three and looked up at Rosa through his visor. His face was
sheened with sweat, his eyes bright.

"Bridge is closed, Chief."

Rosa floated beside the joint and put her gloved hand on it. Through
the suit, she could feel the faint hum of the electromagnetic rail
system — a vibration that ran the length of the bridge, from Promontory
to Abutment, 340 kilometers of engineered structure holding itself
together against the vacuum.

"Run the tension test," she said.

Yuki, monitoring from the control room, ran the sequence. Every cable,
every joint, every sensor — three thousand, four hundred data points
sampled simultaneously.

"All green, Chief. Full bridge tension nominal. Safety margin 2.1 across
the board."

Two point one. Better than spec. Rosa allowed herself a small smile — a
rare indulgence that Deng, who had known her for two years, recognized
as the equivalent of a victory lap.

"Call it in," she said.

Deng opened the comm channel to Promontory Station, to Abutment Station,
to Houston, to New York, to the board of directors and the engineers
and the financial controllers and the skeptics and the believers and the
people who had said it could not be done.

"This is the Trans-Orbital Bridge Project," he said. "The bridge is
complete."

                              * * *

Rosa stayed outside for a while after the others had gone in. She
floated beside Joint One Hundred and Seventy-Three — the midpoint,
the keystone — and looked down the length of the bridge in both
directions. It stretched away from her, a silver thread against the
black, catching the light of a sun that was just cresting the curve
of the Earth, throwing long shadows across the cables and joints and
rails that she had designed and argued for and defended and built.

Three hundred and forty kilometers. One hundred and seventy-three joints.
Six primary cables. An electromagnetic rail system that could move a
twenty-ton car at two hundred kilometers per hour. A self-healing
polymer sheathing that had already proven itself against the random
violence of the micrometeorite environment.

It was not beautiful. Rosa had never cared about beauty. It was
something better than beautiful. It was sound. It was built to spec.
It would hold.

Below her, the Earth turned, patient and luminous, carrying its freight
of cities and oceans and seven billion people who would, for the most
part, never see the bridge or know what it meant. But some of them
would know. Some of them would understand that a line had been drawn
in the void — not a metaphorical line, not an aspiration, but a
physical, load-bearing, engineered fact — and that it changed what
was possible.

Rosa put her hand on the bridge. The hum of the rail system ran through
her glove and into her bones.

She had been an engineer for thirty years. She had built roads and
overpasses and highway interchanges in the long flatness of the
American Midwest. She had built orbital station modules and docking
assemblies and cargo handling systems. She had fought metal fatigue and
micrometeorites and corporate boards and the fundamental hostility of a
universe that did not care whether her structures stood or fell.

And now she had built a bridge. Not a metaphor. A bridge. A real one,
spanning the void between two points that no bridge had ever connected
before.

She stayed there for a long time, her hand on the steel, the hum
running through her, the Earth turning below, the bridge holding fast.

It would hold. She had built it to hold, and it would.

That was enough. That was always enough.

                            [THE END]

                       THE CONFESSION BOOTH

                     by Father Thomas Aquino

================================================================================

                               I.

The penitent entered the confessional at the hour the ship's bells
counted as midnight, though midnight had no astronomical referent when
you were forty-seven years into a voyage between stars. Father Liam
Donovan heard the soft scrape of the curtain, the creak of the kneeler
accepting weight, and then the breathing — quick, shallow, the breathing
of a man in distress.

"Bless me, Father, for I have sinned."

"How long has it been since your last confession?"

"Two years. Perhaps longer. I have not been keeping count."

Father Donovan waited. He had learned, in twenty-three years of
priesthood — nineteen of them aboard the generation ship Canticle — that
the space between the formula and the substance of a confession was the
most important space in the sacrament. It was the space where the
penitent decided how honest to be. You could not rush it. You could
not fill it. You had to let it breathe, as God lets the world breathe
between one moment and the next.

"Father, I am going to kill a man."

Donovan held himself very still. The confessional was a small wooden
booth — real wood, not composites; one of the few artifacts that the
original colonists had brought from Earth, crafted from oak that had
grown in an Irish churchyard and carried aboard the Canticle as both
furniture and symbol. It smelled of polish and age and the faint, dry
scent of recycled air. Through the screen that separated them, Donovan
could see the penitent's shadow but not his face. This was by design.
The confessional preserved anonymity, and anonymity preserved honesty.

"You say you are going to kill a man," Donovan said carefully. "You
speak in the future tense."

"Yes."

"Then you have not yet committed this act."

"No."

"And you are here to confess it before it happens."

A pause. The breathing quickened again. "I know how it sounds. I know
you must think I'm — Father, I need you to understand. I have seen it.
Not imagined it, not planned it, not wished for it. I have seen it. The
way you see a thing that has already happened. A memory, Father. A
memory of something that hasn't occurred yet."

Donovan folded his hands in his lap. His fingers were long and thin,
the fingers of a man who had spent his life handling fragile things —
communion wafers, rosary beads, the confidences of the troubled. He was
sixty-one years old, born aboard the Canticle, as his parents had been
born aboard it, and their parents before them. He had never seen Earth
except in photographs. His world was the ship: six kilometers of steel
and glass and recycled water, carrying eighteen hundred souls through
the interstellar dark toward a destination that his grandchildren might
live to see.

"Tell me what you have seen," he said.

                               II.

The penitent's name — though Donovan did not know it, and could not know
it, and must not know it — was Marcus Fell. He was thirty-eight years
old, a maintenance technician in the ship's water reclamation division,
a quiet man who lived alone in a small cabin on Deck Seven and was known
to his coworkers as competent, reliable, and unremarkable. He had no
history of violence, no criminal record, no psychiatric flag in his
personnel file. He attended the ship's secular community gatherings but
not its religious services. He had come to the confessional for the
first time in his life because he could think of no one else who was
obligated to listen and forbidden to tell.

"It started six weeks ago," the penitent said. "I was sleeping. I woke
up and there was — I don't know how to describe it, Father. A clarity.
As if someone had wiped a film from my eyes that I didn't know was
there. And I could see — not the future, not like a prophet, not a
vision of the heavens. I could see the next three days. Every detail.
Every conversation. Every meal, every shift, every hour. Like a memory
of something I had already lived through."

"And was this vision accurate?"

"I lived those three days exactly as I had seen them. Every detail.
Every word."

"People have dreams that seem prophetic. The mind is —"

"Father, I know the difference between a dream and a memory. The dreams
stopped after the first week. Now it comes when I'm awake. I'll be
sitting in the refectory and suddenly I'm — somewhere else. Somewhere
ahead. I see what will happen, and then time catches up, and it happens
exactly as I saw it."

Donovan was silent for a moment. The ship hummed around them — the
constant, almost subliminal vibration of the engines, the heartbeat of
the Canticle. He had heard many confessions in his years as ship's
chaplain. Adultery, theft, cruelty, despair — the same sins that had
been confessed in every church in Christendom for two thousand years,
translated into the particular idiom of a generation ship where
everyone knew everyone, where privacy was scarce and forgiveness
essential. But he had never heard anything like this.

"And in one of these — memories — you see yourself committing a murder."

"Yes."

"Can you tell me the circumstances? Without revealing anyone's identity."

Another pause. When the penitent spoke again, his voice was lower, and
Donovan could hear the tremor in it — not fear, exactly, but something
deeper. The sound of a man confronting the reality of what he is.

"There is a man. In three weeks, this man will make a decision. A
technical decision, related to the ship's navigation systems. The
decision will seem routine. It will be approved by the proper
authorities. But it will be wrong. Not maliciously wrong — he simply
will not understand the consequences. And those consequences, six months
later, will result in a cascade failure in the guidance array that will
deviate our course by 0.4 degrees. At interstellar distances, 0.4
degrees is —"

"Catastrophic."

"We will miss the target system entirely. The ship will sail into open
space. Eighteen hundred people. Everyone."

Donovan felt a coldness settle into his chest. The confessional seemed
smaller, the oak walls closer. "And you believe that by killing this
man, you will prevent the decision."

"He is the only one qualified to make it. If he is dead, the decision
will fall to his deputy, who will choose differently. I have seen this
too. In the version where the man is dead, the deputy makes the correct
calculation, and the ship arrives safely. In the version where the man
lives, we all die."

"You have seen both outcomes?"

"Yes."

"How?"

"I don't know how. I don't know why this is happening to me. I don't
know if it's God or the devil or some malfunction in my brain. I only
know that I see what I see, and that everything I have seen so far has
come true."

                               III.

Father Donovan did not sleep that night. He lay in his narrow bunk in
the chaplain's quarters — a room barely larger than the confessional
itself, furnished with a cot, a desk, a crucifix, and a small shelf of
books — and stared at the ceiling and thought about what he had been
told.

The seal of confession was absolute. This was not a matter of policy or
preference or pastoral judgment. It was the most inviolable obligation
of his priesthood — more binding than his vow of celibacy, more
fundamental than his obedience to the Church hierarchy. The Fourth
Lateran Council had codified it in 1215, and in the seven centuries
since, the Church had never wavered: what was spoken in confession
could not be revealed, under any circumstances, for any reason. A priest
who violated the seal was automatically excommunicated. The penitent's
words belonged to God alone.

But the penitent had described the death of eighteen hundred people.

Donovan understood the moral architecture of the problem with a clarity
that gave him no comfort. If the penitent's vision was genuine — if he
truly possessed foreknowledge of a navigational disaster — then
Donovan was in possession of information that could save the ship. But
he could not act on it. He could not warn the captain. He could not
inform the navigation division. He could not even hint, in the most
oblique way, that the upcoming decision should be reviewed. To do any
of these things would be to violate the seal, because the information
came from nowhere else and the breach would be traceable to the
confessional.

And if the penitent's vision was not genuine — if he was delusional,
or lying, or suffering from some neurological condition that produced
convincing but false precognition — then the danger was not to the ship
but to the man the penitent intended to kill. In that case, Donovan
still could not act. He could counsel the penitent, he could withhold
absolution, he could pray. But he could not break the seal.

He rose at the hour the ship's bells counted as five in the morning and
said Mass in the small chapel on Deck Three. Fourteen people attended,
as they did most mornings — the ship's faithful, a small but steady
congregation who found in the ancient rituals a continuity that reached
back through the generations to a world they had never seen. Donovan
said the words and performed the gestures and distributed the Eucharist
and felt, for the first time in his priesthood, the terrible weight of
what the sacraments demanded.

After Mass, he sat in his study and opened the book that had been his
companion for forty years: a battered copy of Thomas Aquinas's Summa
Theologica, printed on Earth and passed down through three generations
of ship's chaplains. He turned to the questions on conscience and found,
as he had found many times before, that Aquinas was both illuminating
and insufficient. The Angelic Doctor had much to say about the
obligation to follow a well-formed conscience, but he had not
anticipated the specific case of a priest aboard a generation ship
receiving foreknowledge of disaster in the confessional.

Donovan closed the book and looked at the crucifix on his wall. It was
a simple thing — cast metal, unadorned, made in the ship's workshop by
a parishioner three decades ago. The Christ upon it was thin and
elongated, as though stretched by the gravity of suffering.

"I could use some guidance," Donovan said to it.

The Christ did not answer. Donovan had not expected Him to. In his
experience, God communicated through silence, and the meaning of the
silence was usually: figure it out yourself.

                               IV.

The penitent returned three days later. The same hour. The same
breathing.

"Father."

"I am here."

"I need to know if you can help me."

"I cannot reveal what you have told me. You know this."

"I'm not asking you to reveal it. I'm asking you to — Father, I don't
want to kill anyone. I am not a violent man. I have never struck another
person in my life. But if what I see is true, then one man's death
saves eighteen hundred lives. The mathematics of it —"

"You cannot reduce a human life to mathematics."

"Then what do you reduce it to?"

It was a genuine question, asked without hostility, and Donovan
recognized in it the voice of a man who was reaching for a moral
framework and finding only empty space. The Canticle was a secular
ship. Its population included believers of various faiths, agnostics,
and outright atheists, and the ship's governance was carefully,
deliberately secular. This man had come to a priest not because he
shared the priest's faith but because the priest's office was the only
one that combined two qualities he needed: the obligation to listen and
the prohibition against telling.

"You reduce it to the image of God," Donovan said quietly. "Every human
life bears that image. It cannot be weighed against other lives, because
it is not a quantity. It is a quality — absolute, indivisible,
inherent."

"Even if that one life, through ignorance, destroys eighteen hundred
others?"

"Even then. You may not do evil that good may come."

The penitent was silent for a long time. Donovan could hear him
breathing, and beneath the breathing, he could hear the ship — the
engines, the air systems, the constant murmur of a world in transit.

"Then what am I supposed to do, Father?"

Donovan had been thinking about this for three days. He had prayed, he
had read, he had lain awake in his bunk and argued with himself and
with God and with the shade of Thomas Aquinas. And he had arrived at an
answer that was not an answer but was, he believed, the best he could
offer within the constraints of his obligation.

"You may not kill," he said. "But there are other ways to prevent a
decision."

"What do you mean?"

"I cannot advise you to act on information you have given me in
confession. But I can advise you, as a general matter of conscience,
that if a man believes a decision is wrong, there are legitimate means
of challenging it. One may raise concerns through proper channels. One
may request reviews. One may present evidence to those with authority.
One may be persistent and vocal and troublesome."

"But I have no standing. I'm a water technician. I have no expertise in
navigation."

"Then find someone who does. Someone who might, independently and for
their own reasons, arrive at the same concerns."

Another long silence. Then the penitent said, very softly: "You are
telling me to find another way."

"I am telling you that there is always another way. That is not
optimism. That is faith."

                               V.

Two weeks passed. Father Donovan performed his duties — Mass each
morning, counseling sessions, hospital visits, the small and necessary
rituals of spiritual care on a ship where the voyage was longer than
any single life. He baptized a child. He comforted a widow. He
arbitrated a dispute between neighbors whose cabins shared a thin wall
and incompatible sleep schedules. He did all of this with the same
attentiveness and care he had always brought to his work, and he carried
within him, like a stone in his chest, the knowledge that somewhere on
the ship, a man was deciding whether to commit a murder.

He could not watch for it. He could not investigate. He could not even
pray publicly for guidance, because to do so would be to signal that
something was wrong, and the signal might be traced to the confessional.
The seal was absolute, and absolute meant absolute — not just in speech
but in action, in demeanor, in the direction of his gaze.

He prayed privately. He prayed with the desperate, focused intensity of
a man who has placed his trust in a system he cannot verify and is
waiting to learn whether the trust was warranted. He prayed for the
penitent. He prayed for the man the penitent might kill. He prayed for
the ship and its eighteen hundred souls. He prayed for himself, because
the weight of what he carried was crushing, and he was not certain he
could bear it much longer without breaking.

On the sixteenth day, he heard a piece of news in the refectory that
made his hands go still around his coffee cup. Someone — a maintenance
technician, unnamed in the account — had filed a formal objection with
the Ship's Council regarding a proposed adjustment to the navigation
protocols. The objection cited concerns about the margin of error in
the recalibrated guidance array and requested an independent review by
the backup navigation team.

The Ship's Council, after some deliberation, had granted the review.

Donovan set down his coffee and closed his eyes. He did not know
whether this was the decision the penitent had described. He could not
ask. He could not even allow himself to hope too visibly. But something
in his chest — the stone — shifted, and for the first time in two
weeks, he could breathe without effort.

                              * * *

The penitent came to the confessional one more time. It was three weeks
later, at the same hour, but the breathing was different now — slower,
steadier, the breathing of a man who has set down something heavy.

"Father."

"I am here."

"The review board found the error. They corrected the navigation
protocols. The deputy — the one I told you about — she led the review.
She found it on her own. Without anyone having to die."

Donovan exhaled. It was a sound he had not known he was holding.

"I filed the objection," the penitent said. "I didn't know how. I read
the ship's regulations. I found the section on technical challenges. I
wrote it up and submitted it. They almost threw it out — what does a
water technician know about navigation? But the regulations say any
crew member can file a technical objection, and the Council has to
respond."

"You found another way."

"Yes. Father — do you believe me? About what I see?"

Donovan considered the question. It was, in a certain light, the most
important question he had been asked in his priesthood. Did he believe
that this man possessed genuine foreknowledge? Did he believe in a gift
or a curse or a neurological anomaly that allowed a water reclamation
technician to see the branching paths of the future?

"I believe," he said carefully, "that you acted according to your
conscience, with courage and restraint, and that eighteen hundred people
are alive because of it. Whether the mechanism of your knowledge is
divine or natural or something else entirely — that is a question for
God, and I am content to leave it with Him."

"And my sin? The murder I intended?"

"You confessed the intention. You did not carry it out. You chose
differently, at great cost to yourself. That is not merely the absence
of sin — it is the presence of grace."

"I don't believe in grace, Father."

"That is your prerogative. Grace does not require your belief in order
to operate."

A sound that might have been a laugh. Then the rustle of the curtain,
the creak of the kneeler released, and footsteps moving away.

Father Donovan sat in the confessional for a long time after the
penitent left. The oak walls were warm with the heat of two bodies. The
ship hummed around him, carrying its cargo of souls through the dark
between stars. Eighteen hundred people, alive and ignorant of how close
they had come and what had preserved them: a water technician's vision,
a priest's silence, a bureaucratic regulation about technical
objections, and something that Donovan would call grace whether the
penitent believed in it or not.

He folded his hands and bowed his head and said a prayer of
thanksgiving. Then he said a prayer for the penitent, whose name he did
not know and would never know. Then he sat in the silence of the
confessional and listened to the ship breathe, and was grateful, and
was at peace.

Outside the confessional, the Canticle sailed on. Forty-seven years
from Earth. Perhaps two hundred and fifty-three more to go. The stars
ahead were steady and patient, and the ship pointed toward them
with a precision that had been reviewed, corrected, and confirmed —
by ordinary process, through proper channels, because a quiet man had
found another way.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        COUNTERFEIT COSMOS

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The alien artifact was three inches tall, shaped like a teardrop, and
worth more than most people would earn in a lifetime. Eddie Bloom held
it in his palm and turned it under the desk lamp, watching the light
play across its surface — a shimmering, iridescent blue-black that
seemed to shift and deepen as the angle changed, like oil on water but
denser, more deliberate, as though the color itself had opinions about
how it wanted to be seen.

"It's Kethrani," said the man who had brought it. His name was Lutz,
and he was the kind of person Eddie had spent twenty years trying to
avoid: well-dressed, soft-spoken, and entirely too comfortable in the
company of criminals. "Authenticated by Dr. Miriam Suleiman at the
Xenoarchaeological Institute in Geneva. Provenance traced back to the
Kethrani cache discovered on Ganymede in 2089. Estimated value: four
hundred thousand dollars."

Eddie set the artifact down on the felt pad he used for delicate work.
His workshop occupied the back room of a frame shop on West 43rd Street,
a narrow space crammed with tools, materials, and the accumulated debris
of a career spent making things that were not what they appeared to be.
Eddie was an art forger. He was, by most informed accounts, one of the
best in the business. He had reproduced Old Masters, Art Deco
sculptures, pre-Columbian ceramics, and Victorian silverwork with a
fidelity that had fooled dealers, collectors, and — on three memorable
occasions — the authentication departments of major museums. He was
forty-six years old, slightly built, with the careful hands of a
surgeon and the nervous eyes of a man who knew that his skill set was
not, strictly speaking, legal.

"And you want me to make a copy," Eddie said.

"I want you to make a copy that will fool Dr. Suleiman."

Eddie looked at the artifact again. Kethrani objects were the most
sought-after items in the xenoarchaeological market — the Kethrani being
the only alien civilization whose physical remains had ever been
discovered, a race that had flourished and vanished on several moons of
Jupiter approximately ninety thousand years before humanity figured out
fire. Their artifacts were rare, exquisitely crafted, and made from
materials that Earth science was still struggling to fully analyze. The
iridescent surface of the teardrop in Eddie's hand was produced by a
nanostructured lattice of metallic compounds that did not correspond
exactly to any known terrestrial alloy.

"This is a different kind of job," Eddie said.

"Yes."

"I've never forged alien work before. The materials alone —"

"We can supply the materials. We have access to a source."

Eddie did not ask what source. In his line of work, the provenance of
the materials was someone else's problem. His problem was replication:
study the original, understand its construction, and produce a copy so
faithful that the difference between original and copy became, for all
practical purposes, a philosophical question.

"Fee?"

"Fifty thousand. Half up front, half on delivery."

Eddie looked at the artifact. He looked at Lutz. He looked at the
artifact again.

"I'll need six weeks," he said.

                               II.

The first two weeks were study. Eddie did not begin a forgery by
making it. He began by learning everything he could about the thing
he was going to fake. He read every published paper on Kethrani
artifacts. He studied the authentication protocols used by the
Xenoarchaeological Institute. He obtained — through channels that were
not entirely legitimate — a copy of Dr. Suleiman's most recent
spectroscopic analysis of the Ganymede cache objects, including the
specific wavelength signatures and crystalline structures that her
authentication process tested for.

The Kethrani had been master fabricators. Their artifacts exhibited a
level of precision that was, even by twenty-second-century standards,
remarkable. The nanostructured surface that produced the characteristic
iridescence was not applied or coated — it was integral to the
material, grown from within by a process that the best materials
scientists in the world had described as "probably biological but
we're really just guessing." The internal structure of a Kethrani
artifact was fractal: the same patterns repeated at every scale, from
the macro shape down to the molecular level. It was this fractal
consistency that made authentication possible, because it was
effectively impossible to replicate artificially. You could fake the
surface. You could fake the shape. But you could not fake the
molecular-scale self-similarity that ran all the way through.

Unless you could.

Eddie had made his career on the principle that everything could be
faked. It was not arrogance — it was engineering. Every authentic object
was authentic because it possessed a specific set of measurable
properties. If you could identify those properties and reproduce them,
the result was indistinguishable from the original. The only limit was
the forger's understanding of what the authenticators were looking for.

By the end of the second week, Eddie had a plan. The materials Lutz had
supplied — and he tried not to think too hard about where they came
from — included fragments of genuine Kethrani alloy, salvaged from
damaged or incomplete artifacts. Using these fragments as seed material,
Eddie would grow a new artifact using a modified version of the
molecular deposition technique used in semiconductor manufacturing. The
fractal pattern of the original would serve as a template: he would
scan it at molecular resolution, feed the data into the deposition
system, and let the machine build the copy layer by layer, atom by
atom, reproducing the self-similar structure at every scale.

It was, Eddie reflected, the most technically demanding forgery he had
ever attempted. It was also the most intellectually satisfying. There
was a purity to it — a conversation between the forger and the original
maker, separated by ninety thousand years, conducted in the shared
language of craftsmanship.

He began the scan on a Monday morning and did not leave his workshop
for three days.

                               III.

The anomaly appeared on the fourth day of the scan.

Eddie almost missed it. The molecular-resolution imaging produced
enormous data sets — terabytes of structural information that had to be
processed, filtered, and rendered before the human eye could make sense
of them. He was reviewing the internal lattice structure of the
teardrop, looking for the fractal patterns he would need to reproduce,
when a section of the data did not match.

The fractal pattern was there. It was consistent and self-similar and
beautiful, exactly as the published literature described. But at a
depth of approximately 0.7 millimeters beneath the surface, the pattern
changed. Not dramatically — not in a way that would be visible to any
scan less detailed than the one Eddie was running. But the lattice
spacing shifted by half a nanometer, and the crystalline orientation
rotated by 0.3 degrees, and the spectroscopic signature of the alloy
altered just enough to suggest that the material at this depth was not
the same material as the surface layer.

Eddie stared at the data for a long time. Then he ran the scan again.
Then he ran it a third time, at higher resolution.

The anomaly was real. The teardrop was, beneath its authentic surface,
made of a different material. A material that was very close to genuine
Kethrani alloy — close enough to fool any standard authentication test
— but was not, at the molecular level, the same thing.

The teardrop was a forgery.

Eddie sat back in his chair and let the implications wash over him. He
was being paid to forge a forgery. The "original" that Lutz had brought
him, the artifact that Dr. Suleiman had authenticated, the object with
a provenance traced back to the Ganymede cache — was itself a fake.

A very, very good fake. But a fake.

"Well," Eddie said to the empty workshop, "this changes things."

                               IV.

He did what any self-respecting forger would do when confronted with a
mystery: he investigated. Not out of moral scruple — Eddie had made
his peace with the ethics of his profession years ago — but out of
professional curiosity. Someone had made this fake. Someone with access
to materials and techniques that were, at minimum, equal to Eddie's own.
Someone who had fooled Dr. Miriam Suleiman, which was not easy. And
someone who had done it before Eddie, which meant there was a competitor
in the field that he did not know about.

That bothered him.

He started with the anomalous material. The subsurface layer was not
Kethrani alloy, but it was close — closer than anything Eddie could
have produced with his own equipment. The crystalline structure was
artificial, deposited layer by layer, exactly as Eddie had planned to
do. But the deposition technique was subtly different from anything in
the current literature. The layers were thinner, the orientation
control more precise, and the fractal template had been applied with a
consistency that suggested either a much more advanced fabrication
system or a much more skilled operator.

Eddie pulled up the spectroscopic data on every Kethrani artifact in
the published record — forty-seven objects in total, scattered across
museums, universities, and private collections around the world and
throughout the Jovian system. He compared their published authentication
data with what he was seeing in the anomalous subsurface layer of his
teardrop.

The comparison took two days. What he found at the end of it made him
sit very still in his workshop chair and stare at the wall.

Fourteen of the forty-seven authenticated Kethrani artifacts showed the
same anomaly. The spectroscopic signatures published in the
authentication reports were consistent with genuine Kethrani alloy — on
the surface. But the data, when Eddie extrapolated the subsurface
structure using the mathematical models he had developed for his own
forgery work, suggested the same layered deposition pattern he had
found in his teardrop. The same technique. The same material. The same
hand — or, at the very least, the same method.

Fourteen objects. Three museums, four universities, seven private
collections. Authentication dates ranging from 2091 to 2107 — sixteen
years.

Someone had been forging Kethrani artifacts for sixteen years, and no
one had noticed.

Eddie poured himself a whiskey — cheap rye, the only kind he kept in
the workshop — and thought about it. The skill required was
extraordinary. The access to materials was extraordinary. The patience
was extraordinary. This was not a quick-profit operation. This was a
sustained, methodical campaign to introduce forgeries into the
archaeological record, and it had been running for nearly two decades
without detection.

Why?

The obvious answer was money. Kethrani artifacts commanded enormous
prices, and fourteen forgeries, sold over sixteen years, would represent
a fortune. But the obvious answer did not satisfy Eddie. If money were
the sole objective, the forger could have produced many more than
fourteen objects in sixteen years. The pace was deliberate — one or two
per year — which suggested restraint, patience, and a concern for
avoiding the kind of market saturation that would trigger scrutiny.

It suggested a professional. Someone like Eddie, but better.

He picked up the teardrop and turned it under the lamp again. The
iridescent surface shimmered, beautiful and false, and beneath it, the
false subsurface shimmered too, and beneath that —

Eddie frowned. He went back to the data. He had scanned to a depth of
0.7 millimeters, where he had found the anomalous layer. But the
teardrop was approximately nine millimeters at its thickest point. He
had not scanned deeper because there had been no reason to.

Now there was a reason.

He recalibrated the scanner and ran a deep scan, all the way to the
core. It took eighteen hours. When it was finished, Eddie looked at the
results and poured himself another whiskey.

Beneath the anomalous subsurface layer — the layer that was itself a
forgery — there was another layer. And this layer's spectroscopic
signature was different again. Not Kethrani alloy. Not the forger's
deposition material. Something else. Something that Eddie's databases
could not identify at all.

The teardrop was a forgery of a forgery. And beneath the second
forgery, there was something that was neither authentic Kethrani nor
any known terrestrial fabrication.

Eddie looked at the object in his hand — three inches of nested
deceptions, each layer concealing and distorting the one below it —
and felt, for the first time in his career, completely out of his
depth.

                               V.

He called Lutz the next morning.

"I can't do the job."

"I beg your pardon?"

"The artifact you gave me isn't genuine. It's a forgery. A very good
one, but a forgery. The authentication passed because whoever made it
understood Suleiman's protocols better than Suleiman does. But at
molecular resolution, the subsurface structure is artificial."

A long silence on the line. Then Lutz said, in a voice that had lost
its smoothness: "How deep did you scan?"

Eddie noted the question. Not "are you sure?" Not "that's impossible."
How deep did you scan. Which meant Lutz knew. Or at least suspected.

"Deep enough to find the second layer," Eddie said. "And the third."

Another silence, longer this time.

"Mr. Bloom, I think we need to have a conversation in person."

They met at a diner in Hell's Kitchen — neutral ground, public enough
to discourage unpleasantness, quiet enough for a conversation that
could not be overheard. Lutz arrived without the polished assurance
Eddie had seen in the workshop. He looked tired, and there was
something in his eyes that Eddie recognized: the expression of a man
who has followed a thread and discovered that it leads somewhere he did
not expect.

"The Kethrani artifacts," Lutz said, without preamble. "The ones in the
museums. The ones in the private collections. How many are fakes?"

"At least fourteen. Probably more. I can only identify the ones where
sufficient spectroscopic data has been published."

"And the technique?"

"Consistent across all fourteen. Same materials, same deposition
method, same level of skill. One source. One forger."

Lutz stirred his coffee. He had not drunk any of it. "We've been
tracking this for two years. My clients — I can't name them, you
understand — are collectors who began to suspect that the Kethrani
market was compromised. They hired me to investigate. The artifact I
gave you was a test: we suspected it was a forgery, but we needed
someone with the technical skill to confirm it."

"You could have told me that up front."

"We needed an unbiased analysis. If I had told you it was a suspected
forgery, you would have looked for evidence of forgery. I needed you
to find it on your own."

Eddie conceded the point. "Fine. But that doesn't explain the third
layer. The core material. It's not Kethrani, and it's not terrestrial.
I can't identify it."

Lutz looked at him. "Neither can anyone else. We've had samples from
three different artifacts analyzed at four different labs. No match to
any known material, natural or synthetic."

"Which means?"

"Which means that the forgeries are not copies of genuine Kethrani
artifacts. They are objects of unknown origin, coated with artificial
Kethrani surface layers to make them look like something they are not.
And the genuine Kethrani artifacts — the real ones from the Ganymede
cache — were already extremely rare. If fourteen of the forty-seven
authenticated objects are fakes —"

"Then the Kethrani archaeological record is compromised. Everything we
think we know about Kethrani fabrication techniques could be based
partly on forgeries."

"Worse than that," Lutz said. "If the core material is neither Kethrani
nor human, then someone — or something — has been introducing objects
of unknown origin into the human archaeological record, disguised as
alien artifacts from a civilization that died ninety thousand years ago."

Eddie picked up his coffee and drank it. It was terrible coffee, but it
gave him something to do with his hands while his mind rearranged
itself around the new shape of the problem.

"Someone is forging the cosmos," he said. "Faking the evidence of the
past. And we don't know who, and we don't know why."

"No," Lutz said. "We don't."

They sat in the diner for a long time, two men who made their livings
in the space between authentic and false, staring at a mystery that
was nested like the layers of the teardrop itself — each answer
revealing a deeper question, each truth concealing a more profound
deception, all the way down to a core that neither of them could
identify and that no one, it seemed, was meant to find.

Eddie left the diner and walked home through the November rain. He
still had the teardrop in his coat pocket. He could feel it there — a
small, dense weight against his hip, three inches of layered deception,
a counterfeit of a counterfeit concealing something that was not a
counterfeit at all but simply unknown.

He was a forger. He understood fakes. But this was something else
entirely. This was a fake that did not merely imitate the real — it
replaced it, erased it, substituted a new reality for the old one and
dared anyone to notice the difference.

He would notice the difference. That was what he was good at.

It was, he reflected, the first time in his career that his particular
skill set had been called upon in the service of the truth. He was not
entirely sure how he felt about it. But the puzzle was irresistible,
and Eddie Bloom had never been able to resist a good puzzle.

He went home. He poured a whiskey. He sat down at his workbench and
began, very carefully, to scan the third layer.

                            [THE END]

                       THE DOOMSDAY CAUCUS

                       by Franklin Hoyt

================================================================================

                               I.

They sealed the bunker at 0600 hours on a Tuesday morning, and the
first argument started before the coffee was cold.

The bunker was buried two hundred meters beneath the Swiss Alps, in a
complex that had been built during the last world war and upgraded three
times since for exactly this scenario: the end of the world, or
something near enough to it that the difference ceased to matter. It
was equipped with independent power, water recycling, food stores for
six months, and a communications system that could reach any point on
Earth or in orbit. It was also equipped with a round table — real wood,
mahogany, polished to a sheen that could show you your own reflection —
around which twelve chairs were arranged with the precise, diplomatic
spacing that signified equality among nations.

The twelve people who sat in those chairs were not equal. They
represented nations that ranged from the United States and the Soviet
Union to Costa Rica and Ghana, and the power differentials between them
were so vast that pretending otherwise was itself a form of politics.
But the asteroid did not care about power differentials. The asteroid —
designated 2157-Kali, a nickel-iron body four kilometers in diameter,
currently eleven months from Earth impact — was the most democratic
threat in human history. It would kill everyone equally.

President Martin Hale of the United States sat at the north end of the
table and looked at the faces around him. He was a tall, lean man with
gray temples and the measured calm of a former prosecutor who had
learned that the most effective weapon in any argument was the
appearance of reasonableness. He had been president for three years,
elected on a platform of technological optimism and fiscal restraint,
and he had come to this bunker with a plan. The plan was good. He had
spent six weeks developing it with the best scientists, engineers, and
military strategists his nation could produce. It was feasible,
it was funded, and it required only one thing that Martin Hale could
not unilaterally provide: the cooperation of eleven other nations.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he began. "We have eleven months. I propose we
spend the first hour reviewing the scientific assessment and the second
hour discussing our options. Chairman Volkov, would you agree to this
structure?"

Alexei Volkov, the Premier of the Soviet Union, was a compact man with
a broad face and hooded eyes that gave away nothing. He had been a
military intelligence officer before entering politics, and he
approached diplomacy the way he had once approached interrogation: by
listening, assessing, and waiting for the other person to make a
mistake.

"I would agree," Volkov said, "provided that the scientific assessment
is presented by a neutral party and not by your own scientists, who have
a regrettable tendency to present American interests as scientific
conclusions."

"The assessment will be presented by Dr. Okafor of the International
Astronomical Union," Hale said. "She is Nigerian. I trust that is
neutral enough."

"For the moment," Volkov said, which was, Hale knew, the closest thing
to agreement that a Soviet premier ever offered in the first round.

Dr. Amara Okafor was a small woman with close-cropped hair and the
steady gaze of someone who spent her professional life looking at
objects that could end civilizations. She stood at the head of the room,
beside a screen that showed the trajectory of 2157-Kali in a smooth,
elegant arc that terminated at a point on the Earth's surface
approximately four hundred kilometers south of Mumbai.

"The impact, if undeflected, will occur in eleven months and six days,"
she said. "The energy release will be approximately twenty-three
gigatons — roughly equivalent to five hundred thousand Hiroshima bombs.
The immediate blast zone will encompass most of the Indian subcontinent.
The secondary effects — tsunamis, atmospheric debris, global cooling —
will be catastrophic and worldwide. Conservative estimates suggest a
death toll of two to three billion in the first year, with agricultural
collapse leading to further casualties over the following decade."

She paused to let the numbers settle. Around the table, twelve faces
showed twelve variations of the same expression: the particular mask
that powerful people wear when they are afraid and cannot afford to
show it.

"Deflection is possible," she continued. "But only if we act within the
next four months. After that, the remaining time will be insufficient
for any known technology to alter the asteroid's trajectory by the
necessary margin. I want to be clear about this: four months. Not
eleven. Four. The window is already closing."

                               II.

The argument that followed Dr. Okafor's presentation was, Hale
reflected later, a perfect miniature of every political failure of the
twentieth century compressed into a single afternoon.

It began with the question of method. The Americans proposed a kinetic
deflection: a fleet of heavy impactors, launched from Earth and orbital
platforms, designed to strike the asteroid at high velocity and nudge it
onto a path that would miss Earth by a comfortable margin. The technology
existed. The launch capacity existed. The cost was estimated at sixty
billion dollars, to be shared among the participating nations according
to GDP.

The Soviets objected. Not to the method — Volkov conceded that kinetic
deflection was scientifically sound — but to the command structure. The
fleet would be launched primarily from American and allied facilities.
The mission control would be located in Houston. The military
coordination would be handled by American Space Command. The Soviets,
in short, were being asked to fund and support a mission that would be
entirely under American operational control.

"You are asking us to place the survival of our nation in American
hands," Volkov said. "We have some experience with American hands. We
are not reassured."

"This is not a military operation," Hale said. "This is a planetary
defense mission. The command structure reflects logistical reality, not
political intent."

"In my experience, Mr. President, logistical reality and political
intent are the same thing wearing different clothes."

The Chinese delegation, led by Minister Chen Wei, proposed an
alternative: a joint command structure, with mission control shared
between Houston, Baikonur, and Jiuquan, and operational authority
rotating among the three space-capable nations on a weekly basis.

The Americans rejected this as operationally unworkable. The Soviets
accepted it in principle but proposed modifications that would
effectively give Baikonur veto authority over launch decisions. The
Chinese modified their proposal to address the Soviet concerns, which
introduced new concerns from the British and French delegations, who
felt that the European contribution to the deflection fleet — which
was substantial — was being overlooked in a trilateral negotiation that
treated them as spectators.

By the end of the third hour, the table had fractured along exactly the
lines that anyone with a passing knowledge of twentieth-century
geopolitics would have predicted: the Americans and their allies on one
side, the Soviets and theirs on the other, the Non-Aligned nations —
India, Ghana, Brazil, Costa Rica — caught in the middle, their voices
raised in increasingly frustrated appeals for unity that no one was
listening to.

Hale watched it happen and felt a familiar, sick sensation in his
stomach. He had seen this before. He had seen it in arms control
negotiations, in trade disputes, in climate accords. The same pattern,
repeated with the reliability of a natural law: a genuine crisis, a
genuine desire to act, and an institutional incapacity to subordinate
national interest to collective survival. The table was round, but the
power was not, and every person in the room knew it, and the knowing
poisoned every word they spoke.

                               III.

It was Delegate Nkrumah of Ghana who broke the impasse, and he did it
not with a proposal but with a question.

Francis Nkrumah was the youngest person at the table — forty-one,
educated at Oxford and Accra, a former schoolteacher who had entered
politics because he believed, with a conviction that his colleagues
found either admirable or naive, that politics was the art of solving
problems rather than the art of accumulating power. He had listened to
five hours of debate with a patience that was, by the fifth hour,
visibly fraying.

"I would like to ask a question," he said, during a lull in the
exchange between the American and Soviet delegations. "Not a diplomatic
question. A practical one."

Hale nodded. "Go ahead."

"If the asteroid hits, how many people in this room will survive?"

Silence. Not the productive silence of reflection, but the uncomfortable
silence of a truth that everyone had been avoiding.

"We are in a bunker," Nkrumah continued. "We have food, water, and air
for six months. We will survive the impact. We may even survive the
first year. But our nations will not. Our cities will not. Our
families — unless we have had the foresight and the selfishness to
bring them here — will not. So I ask again: who are we saving? Because
from where I sit, it appears that we are negotiating the survival of
our political positions rather than the survival of our people."

"Delegate Nkrumah —" Volkov began.

"I am not finished. I represent a nation of six million people. We have
no space program. We have no nuclear arsenal. We have no seat on the
Security Council. What we have is six million human beings who will die
if this asteroid hits, and whose deaths will mean nothing — nothing —
to the calculations being made at this table. I have listened for five
hours to arguments about command structures and operational authority
and GDP-weighted cost sharing, and I have not heard a single person say
the only thing that matters: that every person on this planet has an
equal right to live, and that our job — our only job — is to make that
possible."

The silence that followed was different from the first. It was the
silence of people who have been told the truth and are deciding what to
do with it.

                              * * *

Hale called a recess. He needed one. He stood in the corridor outside
the conference room, drinking water from a paper cup, and thought about
what Nkrumah had said. The Ghanaian delegate was right, and Hale knew
it, and the knowing did not help, because being right and being
effective were not the same thing, and the gap between them was where
people died.

He had come to this bunker with a plan. The plan was good. But the plan
required cooperation, and cooperation required trust, and trust
required a history of trustworthiness that none of the nations at the
table could honestly claim. The Americans had overthrown governments.
The Soviets had occupied countries. The Europeans had colonized
continents. The history of international relations was a history of
betrayal, and the asteroid was testing whether the species could
overcome that history in eleven months.

Four months, he corrected himself. The window for deflection was four
months.

He went back into the conference room.

                               IV.

The breakthrough, when it came, was not dramatic. It was not a grand
speech or a noble concession or a moment of visionary leadership. It
was a compromise — ugly, imperfect, and bitterly contested — that
satisfied no one completely and everyone enough.

The kinetic deflection fleet would be launched from American, Soviet,
and Chinese facilities simultaneously. Mission control would be located
at a neutral site — the European Space Operations Centre in Darmstadt,
Germany — staffed by a multinational team and overseen by a five-member
command authority consisting of the three space powers, plus one
rotating seat for the Non-Aligned nations and one for the European
coalition. Costs would be shared according to a modified formula that
weighted GDP against population, ensuring that smaller nations
contributed less in absolute terms but were not entirely excluded from
the financial burden — a point that Nkrumah insisted on, arguing that
nations which contributed nothing would have no ownership of the
outcome and no voice in its execution.

The compromise was reached at 0200 hours on Wednesday morning, nineteen
hours after the bunker had been sealed. By that time, the mahogany
table was littered with coffee cups and paper and the detritus of
argument. The delegates were exhausted. Several had loosened their ties.
Minister Chen had removed her shoes. Volkov had smoked half a pack of
cigarettes, in defiance of the bunker's ventilation system and the
protests of the Costa Rican delegate, who had asthma.

Hale looked around the table. Twelve faces, drawn with fatigue, tight
with the residue of disagreement. This was not unity. This was not the
noble, collective response that the crisis demanded and that history
would, in retrospect, pretend had occurred. This was twelve people
who had spent nineteen hours fighting and had arrived, through sheer
exhaustion and the pressure of a four-month deadline, at an arrangement
that was better than nothing and worse than what was needed.

It would have to do.

"Do we have agreement?" he asked.

Volkov looked at him for a long moment. Then he nodded. One by one,
the others followed. Chen. Nkrumah. The British PM. The French
president. The Indian prime minister. The Brazilian delegate. Costa Rica.

Twelve nods. Not enthusiastic. Not confident. But sufficient.

"Then we begin," Hale said.

                               V.

The deflection fleet launched eleven weeks later — three weeks ahead of
the deadline, a fact that surprised everyone involved and that was
attributable, in roughly equal measure, to the urgency of the threat
and the competitive pride of three space programs that would rather
have died than been the last to launch.

Hale watched the American launches from the Situation Room in the White
House, surrounded by generals and scientists and advisors who had spent
the past three months working without sleep to make this possible. The
Soviet launches he watched on a video feed from Baikonur, relayed
through the Darmstadt control center. The Chinese launches came last,
twelve hours later, and when the final impactor achieved orbit, the
room erupted in a sound that Hale had never heard in the Situation
Room before: applause.

He did not applaud. He sat in his chair and watched the tracking data
on the main screen — twenty-six impactors on converging trajectories,
accelerating toward a rock that was still, at this distance, invisible
to the naked eye — and thought about Nkrumah.

The Ghanaian delegate had been right. Every argument in the bunker had
been a microcosm of every failure of the century: the inability to
see past national interest, the confusion of power with wisdom, the
pathological refusal to act collectively until the alternative was
annihilation. The species had risen to the occasion, but it had risen
slowly, grudgingly, and at the last possible moment, and the manner of
the rising did not inspire confidence that it could be repeated.

The impactors struck 2157-Kali on a Sunday morning. The impact was
visible from Earth orbit — a brief, bright flash against the dark of
space, followed by a plume of debris that caught the sunlight and
scattered it in a fan of light that was, despite everything, beautiful.
The tracking data confirmed deflection within minutes: the asteroid's
trajectory had shifted by 0.07 degrees — a tiny number that
translated, over the remaining distance, to a miss of forty-two
thousand kilometers.

The world celebrated. Hale watched the celebrations on television — the
crowds in Times Square, Red Square, Tiananmen, Accra — and felt not
triumph but something more complicated: a relief so profound it was
indistinguishable from grief. Grief for what the crisis had revealed
about the species. Grief for the knowledge that the next crisis would
produce the same arguments, the same failures, the same last-minute
scramble toward a compromise that was less than what was needed and more
than what was deserved.

He picked up the phone and called Nkrumah.

"We did it," Hale said.

"Yes," Nkrumah said. "The question is whether we learned anything."

Hale looked out the window of the Oval Office. The sky was clear and
blue and infinite, and somewhere beyond it, a rock was sailing past the
Earth, deflected by the combined effort of a species that had argued
for nineteen hours about who would be in charge of saving itself.

"I don't know," he said.

"Neither do I," Nkrumah said. "But the question is worth asking.
Because the next one will come, Mr. President. The universe is not
short of rocks."

Hale hung up the phone. He sat at his desk for a long time, alone in
the room where power lived, and thought about rocks and tables and the
distance between what a species could do and what it could agree to do.

The distance, he thought, was the most dangerous space in the universe.
More dangerous than the void between stars. More dangerous than the
trajectory of any asteroid.

It was the space between twelve chairs at a round table.

And he did not know how to bridge it.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                       THE WANDERER'S REST

                       by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The planet appeared first as a change in the quality of the light.

Elias Sundström noticed it from the observation gallery on the forward
deck of the Covenant — a gallery that had been empty for most of his
life, because for most of his life there had been nothing to observe.
The stars moved, of course, in the imperceptible way that stars move
when you are crossing the distances between them: slowly, over decades,
the constellations shifting from their remembered shapes into new
arrangements that the ship's astronomers dutifully catalogued and named,
though no one on Earth would ever see the sky from this angle. But the
stars were a constant. They did not change their quality. They were
points of light, and they remained points of light, and the distances
between them remained vast and dark and empty.

Now, one of the points was changing. It was growing brighter, and it
was growing warmer — shifting from the cold white of a distant star to
something that carried, at the very edge of perception, a faint amber
tone. The tone of a sun seen through atmosphere. The tone of a world.

Elias stood at the gallery window — three meters of transparency that
separated the pressurized interior of the ship from the vacuum — and
watched the light change. He was seventy-four years old, which made him
among the oldest people aboard the Covenant. He had been born on the
ship, as his parents had been born on it, and their parents before them.
His great-grandparents, on both sides, had been among the original
colonists who had boarded the Covenant in the shipyards of Stockholm
three hundred and twelve years ago.

Three hundred and twelve years. The number had the quality of a
scripture — something recited, something known, something that carried
meaning beyond its arithmetic. Three hundred and twelve years since the
ship had left Earth. Three hundred and twelve years of recycled air and
recycled water and the slow, patient propagation of a species that had
chosen to cross the abyss between stars in the only way it could: by
living through it, generation after generation, parents giving way to
children giving way to grandchildren, each generation carrying the
mission forward like a candle flame passed from hand to hand in a dark
cathedral.

And now the candle was arriving. The star ahead was Tau Ceti, and the
planet that orbited it — the planet that the original colonists had
chosen as their destination, based on spectroscopic data gathered from
telescopes on Earth — was becoming visible. Not yet as a disc, not yet
as a world with geography and weather, but as a quality of light. A
warmth. A promise.

Elias pressed his palm against the window. The glass was cold — it was
always cold, the vacuum on the other side a constant theft of heat —
and through it, very faintly, he could feel the vibration of the ship's
engines, which had been running continuously for three hundred and
twelve years and which, within the next few months, would begin the
long process of deceleration that would bring the Covenant to rest.

He had waited his entire life for this light.

                              * * *

The announcement came the following morning, from Captain Ingrid Holm,
in the measured tones that the ship's command tradition prescribed for
communications of significance. Every captain of the Covenant spoke
this way — carefully, formally, with a gravity that acknowledged the
weight of what they said — because every communication of significance
aboard a generation ship was, in a sense, a communication across time.
The words would be recorded, archived, passed down. Someday, someone
would listen to them and judge.

"Citizens of the Covenant. This is Captain Holm. I am pleased to
confirm that our long-range sensors have achieved resolution on our
destination. Tau Ceti IV is visible. Spectroscopic analysis is
consistent with the projections made at the time of our departure: the
planet possesses a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere, liquid water, and a
surface temperature range compatible with human habitation.

"However."

The word hung in the ship's corridors and gathering spaces and private
cabins like a held breath.

"Our sensors have also detected a second vessel in orbit around Tau
Ceti IV. The vessel is of human origin. It is broadcasting a standard
transponder signal identifying it as the Aurelius, a colony ship
launched from Earth one hundred and fourteen years after the Covenant's
departure."

Silence. A silence so complete that Elias, standing in the gallery,
could hear the ship breathing — the air systems, the water recyclers,
the constant, almost subliminal hum of a world in transit.

"The Aurelius appears to have arrived at Tau Ceti IV approximately
forty years ago. Preliminary sensor data indicates the presence of an
established settlement on the planet's surface."

Captain Holm paused. When she spoke again, her voice was the same —
measured, formal, careful — but Elias heard something beneath it that
no command tradition could fully conceal. The sound of a woman
delivering news that changed everything.

"We will make contact with the Aurelius within the hour. I will
address the ship again when we know more. In the meantime, I ask for
your patience, your composure, and your trust. We have traveled three
hundred and twelve years to reach this place. We will not be undone
by surprise. Holm out."

                               II.

The Aurelius had been launched in 2184, one hundred and fourteen years
after the Covenant. It had traveled faster — vastly faster — using a
fusion pulse drive that had been developed in the decades following the
Covenant's departure. Where the Covenant had crawled through the
interstellar medium at eight percent of light speed, enduring the
journey through the brute mechanism of biological succession, the
Aurelius had made the crossing in seventy years, its crew spending most
of the voyage in cryogenic suspension, waking only for scheduled
maintenance intervals.

It had arrived at Tau Ceti IV forty-two years ago. Its colonists —
three thousand of them — had established a settlement on the planet's
largest continent, a temperate landmass they had named New Geneva. They
had built homes, cleared fields, constructed infrastructure. They had
children and grandchildren. They had a functioning society.

They had been waiting, with some curiosity and considerable awkwardness,
for the Covenant to arrive.

All of this Elias learned in the hours following Captain Holm's
announcement, as the Covenant's communication officers established
contact with the settlement and the two crews began the cautious,
formal process of introducing themselves. The exchanges were polite.
They were also, beneath the politeness, saturated with an unspoken
tension that Elias felt in every word.

The Covenant carried two thousand, four hundred people. They were the
descendants of the original colonists — people who had given up
everything, who had committed their children and their children's
children and their children's children's children to a voyage from
which there was no return, because they believed that the destination
was worth the sacrifice. They had maintained the ship for three
centuries. They had endured the isolation, the confinement, the slow
erosion of meaning that came from living in a world that was going
somewhere but never arriving. They had kept faith with the mission
through twelve generations of birth and death and the patient handing
on of purpose.

And now they learned that their sacrifice had been unnecessary.

The planet was already settled. The work was already done. Someone else
had gotten there first — not through greater courage or greater
endurance, but through better technology, developed after the Covenant
had left. The Covenant's colonists had spent three hundred years
crossing the void, and the answer to their journey had overtaken them
in transit.

Elias sat in the gallery and watched the planet grow in the window. It
was beautiful. He could see continents now, and clouds, and the blue
gleam of oceans. It looked, from this distance, like the photographs of
Earth that hung in the ship's archive — the world that none of them had
ever seen, the world that existed only as a concept, a origin point, a
story told to children about where the journey had begun.

He should have felt joy. They had arrived. The destination was real and
habitable and waiting for them.

Instead, he felt something he could not name. Something that was not
grief and not anger but lived in the territory between them. A
hollowness. A subtraction. As though something essential had been
removed from the center of his life — the purpose that had organized
it, the meaning that had justified it — and what remained was the
shape of a life that no longer made sense.

                               III.

The first face-to-face meeting took place aboard the Covenant, in the
large assembly hall on Deck Two that served as the ship's parliament,
its theater, and its cathedral. Captain Holm had insisted that the
meeting take place on the Covenant rather than on the planet or aboard
the Aurelius, and the insistence carried a weight that everyone
understood without it being spoken: this was the Covenant's moment.
Whatever it turned out to mean, it would happen here, on the ship
that had earned it through three centuries of endurance.

The delegation from New Geneva was led by Governor Marianne Descamps,
a woman of sixty with silver hair and the composed, careful manner of
someone who had been preparing for this conversation for a long time.
She brought with her three council members and a historian — the
historian being, Elias thought, the most telling choice. You brought a
historian when you expected the conversation to be remembered.

Governor Descamps stood at the front of the assembly hall and looked
out at the citizens of the Covenant — two thousand four hundred faces,
young and old, arranged in the tiered seating that rose from the floor
to the ceiling — and when she spoke, her voice was steady and kind and
carried within it something that Elias recognized, with a surprise that
was almost physical, as shame.

"Citizens of the Covenant," she said. "On behalf of the people of New
Geneva, I welcome you to Tau Ceti. I want to begin by saying something
that I have been preparing to say for as long as I have held this
office, and that the people of New Geneva have been preparing to say
for forty-two years."

She paused.

"We are sorry."

The hall was silent. The word settled into it like snow.

"We know what you have done. We know what your ancestors chose, and
what every generation since has honored. You crossed the void between
stars in the only way that was possible when you left, and you did it
knowing that the crossing would consume your lives and the lives of
your children. The people who built the Aurelius knew this. They knew
that a ship was already in transit — your ship — and that the new
drive technology would overtake it. They debated whether to go at all,
knowing that their arrival would make your voyage, in a certain sense,
unnecessary."

She paused again. Elias watched her face. She was choosing her words
with a care that suggested she had rehearsed them many times and was
not satisfied with any version.

"They went anyway. The reasons were practical: the new drive was
untested over interstellar distances, and there was no guarantee it
would work. The Covenant was the insurance. If the Aurelius failed,
the Covenant would still arrive. If the Aurelius succeeded — as it
did — then both ships would contribute to the colony. That was the
logic. It was sound logic. But logic does not account for what it
means to travel three hundred years and find that someone has arrived
before you."

A murmur ran through the hall. Not anger — something quieter. The
sound of people processing a truth they had suspected but not yet
heard spoken.

"We have built a place for you," Descamps continued. "Land has been
set aside. Homes are being prepared. You are not guests here — this
planet is as much yours as ours. More, perhaps. You were promised this
world before we were born. That promise has not been revoked by our
presence. It has been — complicated."

She stopped. The word hung in the air, and it was, Elias thought, the
most honest word she had spoken.

Complicated.

                               IV.

In the days that followed, the citizens of the Covenant debated what to
do. The debate was held in the assembly hall, in the tradition of the
ship's parliament, and it was open to all, and it was the most
difficult conversation the ship had ever held.

Some wanted to land immediately. The planet was there. The homes were
waiting. Three hundred years of voyage had earned them the right to
feel solid ground under their feet, to breathe air that had not been
recycled ten thousand times, to look up and see a sky instead of a
ceiling.

Others were not so certain. They spoke about identity, about meaning,
about the particular culture that had evolved aboard the Covenant over
three centuries — a culture of patience, of conservation, of careful
stewardship, of the knowledge that every resource was finite and every
action consequential. The planet would change them. The open sky would
change them. The presence of a society that was already established, that
had its own customs and assumptions and ways of doing things — that
would change them most of all.

"We will become their dependents," said Karin Lindqvist, who taught
history in the ship's school and who had spent her life studying the
culture of the Covenant with the devotion of an anthropologist. "They
have forty years of settlement experience. They know the planet. They
know the climate, the soil, the dangers. We know how to live on a
ship. The transition will not be a partnership — it will be an
apprenticeship. And in a generation, the Covenant's culture will be
absorbed into theirs. Everything we have built, everything we have
maintained for three hundred years — the language of this ship, the
traditions, the way we raise our children and bury our dead — will
become a footnote in someone else's history."

"And is that not acceptable?" said Tomas Eriksson — no relation to
Elias, though they shared a surname, as many aboard the Covenant
shared surnames after twelve generations of a closed population. Tomas
was young, thirty-two, an engineer who worked in the ship's propulsion
section. "We came here to build a life on a new world. The world is
here. The fact that someone else arrived first does not change the
purpose of our voyage. It changes only the circumstances of our
arrival."

"Circumstances are not trivial," Karin said. "Circumstances are
everything. The purpose of our voyage was not merely to arrive — it was
to build something new. To create a society from nothing, on a world
that had never been touched. That opportunity is gone. What remains is
assimilation."

The word rang in the hall like a struck bell, and Elias, sitting in his
customary seat in the upper tier, understood that this was the true
wound. Not the loss of priority. Not the embarrassment of obsolescence.
But the fear that the Covenant's three-hundred-year experiment in human
endurance would be dissolved, like salt in water, into a larger society
that had not earned it and could not understand it.

                              * * *

Elias spoke on the third day of debate. He had not planned to speak.
He was not a public person — he had spent his life as the ship's head
gardener, tending the hydroponic bays that produced most of the
Covenant's fresh food, and his skills were horticultural rather than
rhetorical. But he had sat in the gallery and watched the planet grow,
and he had listened to the arguments, and something had settled in him
that needed to be said.

He stood slowly — his knees were not what they had been — and the hall
quieted. The Covenant's citizens were accustomed to listening to their
elders. It was one of the traditions that Karin was afraid of losing.

"I have been a gardener for fifty years," Elias said. "I know
something about seeds. A seed does not choose the soil it lands in.
It does not choose the season, or the weather, or the company of
other plants. It lands where the wind carries it, and it grows, or
it does not. What matters is not the soil. What matters is the seed."

He paused. The hall was very quiet.

"We are the seed. Not the ship — the ship is the vessel, the carrier,
the wind. We are the seed. Three hundred years of living, of loving,
of raising children and burying parents and maintaining this ship and
keeping faith with a promise that none of us made but all of us
honored — that is the seed. And the seed does not become less because
the soil has been turned before it arrives. It becomes what it has
always been. It grows."

He looked out at the faces. Young and old, frightened and hopeful,
uncertain about everything except the fact that they were here, together,
at the end of a journey that had consumed twelve generations.

"I say we land," Elias said. "Not because the homes are waiting, and
not because the planet is beautiful, though it is. I say we land
because that is what we came to do. And what we bring with us — the
patience, the care, the knowledge of how to live within limits — that
is not a footnote. That is a gift. And this new world will need it,
whether it knows it yet or not."

He sat down. The applause, when it came, was quiet and sustained, the
sound of a people deciding.

                               V.

The Covenant entered orbit around Tau Ceti IV on a morning that Elias
measured not by the ship's clock but by the light. The planet filled
the gallery window, enormous and blue-green and alive, and the light
that poured through the glass was not the cold, filtered light of
stars but the warm, scattered light of a sun seen through atmosphere
— the light of a world.

The landing shuttles were prepared. The settlement of New Geneva had
cleared a field — a broad, flat expanse of grassland on the northern
edge of the colony — and marked it with lights, visible from orbit, as
a welcome. The Covenant's citizens packed what they could carry:
personal belongings, family records, seeds from the hydroponic bays.
Elias packed seeds. He had been saving particular strains for decades,
varieties that had adapted to the ship's artificial light and recycled
water over three hundred years of cultivation. They were not the same
plants that had been brought from Earth. They had changed. They had
become something new — something that had never existed before, shaped
by the particular conditions of a journey that would never be repeated.

He held the seed packets in his hands — small envelopes, carefully
labeled in his neat gardener's script — and thought about what they
represented. Not just plants. Not just food. A record. A living record
of three hundred years of adaptation, of change, of the slow, patient
work of growing things in a place where nothing was supposed to grow.

The first shuttle launched at 0600, carrying Captain Holm and the
advance party. Elias watched it go from the gallery — a bright point
of light descending toward the planet's surface, growing smaller and
smaller against the blue until it vanished into the atmosphere.

He would go on the fourth shuttle. He had requested this specifically
— not the first, not the last, but somewhere in the middle, because
that was where he had always been: in the middle of the journey, in the
middle of the work, in the middle of the long, patient process of
growing things.

When his turn came, he walked to the shuttle bay with his seed packets
in his coat and his hand on the corridor wall, feeling for the last
time the vibration of the ship that had been his world for seventy-four
years. The steel was warm under his fingers. The air tasted of
recycled water and the faint green scent of the hydroponic bays.

He stepped into the shuttle. The door closed behind him. Through the
window, he could see the Covenant — the whole ship, for the first time
in his life, from the outside — and it was smaller than he had imagined.
A cylinder of steel and glass, six kilometers long, hanging in the
light of an alien sun. It had carried twenty-four hundred people across
twelve light-years of void. It had been home to twelve generations. It
had fulfilled its purpose.

The shuttle descended. The planet rose to meet it — clouds, then blue
sky, then green land, then the bright points of the settlement lights,
then the texture of grass and soil and the faint, astonishing scent of
air that had never been inside a machine.

Elias stepped onto the ground. His knees trembled — partly from age,
partly from the gravity, which was stronger than the ship's rotation
had simulated, partly from something else that he did not try to name
because naming it would diminish it.

He knelt. He took a handful of soil. It was dark and cool and alive
with the particular smell of a world that had been growing things for
four billion years without any help from anyone.

He opened his coat and took out the seed packets. He held them for a
moment — three hundred years of adaptation, twelve generations of
careful cultivation, the living record of a journey — and then he
knelt in the turned earth of an alien world and began, with the slow,
practiced hands of a gardener, to plant.

Above him, the sky was open and vast and blue, and in it, barely
visible against the daylight, the Covenant hung in orbit — a point of
light, a memory, a vessel that had carried its cargo of seeds across
the dark and delivered them, at last, to soil.

The seeds would grow. They always did.

It was what seeds were for.

                            [THE END]

                       DEAD RUN TO PLUTO

                     by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

The trouble started, as trouble usually did in Jake Trent's line of
work, with a knock on his door at three in the morning.

Jake was asleep in his bunk aboard the Jackrabbit — a mail courier
sloop, Reyes-class, seventeen years old and showing every one of them —
docked at Ceres Station and running through a forty-eight-hour layover
that he had planned to spend doing exactly what he was doing: sleeping.
The Jackrabbit's engines were cold, her tanks were half full, and Jake's
manifest showed nothing pending for another six days. He had earned the
rest. The Ceres-to-Mars run had been a grinder — solar storm delays,
a balky gyroscope, and a customs inspector on Phobos who had taken a
personal interest in the contents of Jake's cargo hold, which were, for
once, entirely legitimate.

The knock came again. Hard, insistent, the knock of someone who was
not going to go away.

Jake rolled out of his bunk, pulled on his boots, and palmed the hatch
release. The man standing in the corridor was short, round, sweating
through an expensive suit, and holding a briefcase with both hands as
though it contained his firstborn child.

"Jake Trent?"

"At this hour, I'm barely Jake Trent. What do you want?"

"My name is Wheelock. I represent the firm of Ashford, Dent, and
Castellano, attorneys at law, Luna City. I need you to deliver this
briefcase to Charon Station on Pluto. The contents are a signed
executive pardon for a man named Victor Gale, who is currently
scheduled to be executed in ninety-six hours."

Jake looked at the briefcase. He looked at Wheelock. He looked at the
clock on the bulkhead behind him, which confirmed that it was, in fact,
three in the morning.

"Pluto," he said.

"Yes."

"In ninety-six hours."

"Yes."

"Mister, I don't know who told you I could make a Ceres-to-Pluto run
in ninety-six hours, but they were pulling your leg. Best transit time
from here to Pluto at current orbital positions is — " He did the
math in his head. The outer planets were scattered across the solar
system like pool balls after a bad break, and Pluto, as usual, was
about as far from Ceres as it could get without leaving the solar
system entirely. "— eighty-eight hours, assuming I burn hard and don't
sleep."

"Then you have eight hours to spare."

"I have eight hours of margin on a four-day burn through the outer
system. That's not margin. That's a prayer."

"The firm is prepared to pay twenty thousand dollars. Cash. Upon
confirmation of delivery."

Jake Trent had been a mail courier for eleven years. He had hauled
letters, legal documents, biological samples, diplomatic pouches, and
the occasional item that he was paid not to ask about, across the inner
system and out to the Jovian stations and back. He was good at his job.
He was fast, he was reliable, and he knew the routes the way a cab
driver knows the streets — every shortcut, every timing window, every
gravitational slingshot that could shave an hour off a transit.

Twenty thousand dollars was more than he usually made in four months.

"What did this Gale do?" he asked.

"He was convicted of murder. He maintains his innocence. New evidence
has come to light. The governor has signed the pardon, but the pardon
must be physically delivered to the warden of Charon Station before the
execution can be stayed. Electronic transmission is not sufficient —
Charon Station operates under Frontier Justice Protocol, which requires
original documents with physical signatures and biometric seals."

"Frontier Justice Protocol. That's the one they wrote to keep Earth
from interfering with outer system courts."

"The very same. A pardon is not valid until the original document is in
the warden's hand. We have been unable to find a courier closer to
Pluto. You are our last option, Mr. Trent."

Jake looked at the briefcase again. Twenty thousand dollars. A man's
life. Ninety-six hours, minus the eighty-eight it would take to get
there.

"I'll need full tanks," he said. "And someone to pull my gyroscope and
give it a kick. It's been drifting."

Wheelock opened the briefcase — not the delivery briefcase, Jake noted,
but a second one he'd been carrying under his arm — and produced a
credit chip. "The firm will cover all expenses. Fuel, repairs, anything
you need. Just get there."

Jake took the credit chip and the delivery briefcase and the knowledge
that somewhere out past Jupiter, a man named Victor Gale was counting
hours.

"I'll leave in two," he said.

                               II.

The Jackrabbit cleared Ceres Station at 0517 hours, running hot and
heavy with full tanks and a freshly calibrated gyroscope, and Jake
pointed her nose at the patch of sky where Pluto would be in eighty-
eight hours and opened the throttle.

The Reyes-class sloop was not a pretty ship. She was built for speed
and endurance, not aesthetics — a narrow hull with oversized engines, a
minimal crew cabin, and a cargo hold that could accommodate exactly one
mail courier's worth of parcels, documents, and questionable decisions.
Jake had bought her used eight years ago, rebuilt her engines twice,
replaced her navigation computer three times, and patched her hull more
often than he cared to remember. She was old and she was cranky and she
smelled permanently of engine grease and stale coffee, and she was the
fastest privately owned ship in the Belt.

Jake loved her the way a jockey loves a horse: with a deep, practical
affection rooted in mutual dependence and a shared willingness to run
until something broke.

The first twelve hours were clean. Jake burned at maximum thrust,
pushing the Jackrabbit out of the asteroid belt and into the long,
empty stretch between Jupiter's orbit and the outer darkness. The ship
hummed around him — engines, life support, the constant chatter of the
navigation computer updating its trajectory calculations — and Jake
settled into the rhythm of a long burn: check the instruments, check
the course, check the fuel, drink coffee, repeat.

He ate a meal pack at the six-hour mark and another at twelve. He did
not sleep. Sleep was a luxury he could not afford on this run. The
eight-hour margin was already thin, and any delay — mechanical,
navigational, or otherwise — would eat into it like acid.

At the sixteen-hour mark, the proximity alarm went off.

Jake was in the head when it sounded — the sharp, insistent tone that
meant something was close enough to worry about. He zipped up, dove for
the cockpit, and pulled up the sensor display.

A ship. Not on any filed flight plan, not broadcasting a transponder
signal, sitting dead in space approximately two hundred kilometers
ahead and directly on Jake's plotted course. It was small — about the
size of the Jackrabbit — and it was dark, running without navigation
lights, which was either illegal, foolish, or deliberate.

Jake adjusted course to pass wide. As he did, the dark ship lit up its
engines and moved to intercept.

"Well," Jake said to the empty cockpit, "that's not friendly."

He had no weapons. Mail couriers did not carry weapons — they were
protected, in theory, by interplanetary postal accords that made
interfering with mail delivery a federal offense in every jurisdiction
from Mercury to Pluto. In practice, the accords were worth exactly as
much as the nearest patrol ship, which at this distance from
civilization was worth nothing at all.

Jake did what he always did when someone tried to get in his way: he
went faster. The Jackrabbit had speed to burn — literally; he pushed
the engines ten percent past their rated maximum, a trick he had
learned from a mechanic on Ganymede who had told him, with the casual
authority of a man who had blown up two ships, that Reyes-class engines
were over-engineered by exactly ten percent and could handle the abuse
"for a while."

The dark ship tried to match his acceleration. It could not. The
Jackrabbit pulled away, the distance between them widening from two
hundred kilometers to three hundred, to four hundred, to five, and then
the dark ship fell behind and Jake watched it shrink on the rear
sensors until it was just another dot in the void.

"Someone," Jake said to the Jackrabbit, "does not want us to make this
delivery."

The Jackrabbit did not answer, but her engines ran steady and strong,
and Jake patted the console the way you pat a horse's neck after a
hard run.

                               III.

The second attempt came at the forty-hour mark, and it was more
sophisticated.

Jake had crossed Jupiter's orbit and was deep in the outer system now,
in the vast, cold emptiness between the gas giants and the ice worlds
where the sun was a bright star and nothing else. The Jackrabbit was
running well — engines nominal, fuel consumption on target, course
true — and Jake had allowed himself a brief nap, twenty minutes in the
pilot's chair with one eye metaphorically open, when the navigation
computer flagged an anomaly in the route ahead.

A debris field. Dense, metallic, approximately the size of a football
stadium, sitting directly in his path at a distance of eight hundred
kilometers. It had not been there on his charts. It had not been
reported by any traffic control authority. It had, according to the
computer's analysis, the spectroscopic signature of processed steel,
which meant it was not natural debris.

Someone had dumped a load of scrap metal in his flight path.

Jake did the math. Going around the debris field would cost him three
hours — nearly half his remaining margin. Going through it was possible
but risky: the Jackrabbit's hull was tough enough to handle small
impacts, but a chunk of steel at the wrong angle could punch through
the hull plating and end the run in a very permanent way.

He chose a middle option. He would go through, but slowly, using the
ship's forward sensors to thread a path between the larger pieces.
It would cost him time — maybe ninety minutes — but less than going
around.

The ninety minutes were the longest of Jake's career. He flew manually,
hands on the stick, eyes on the sensor display, weaving the Jackrabbit
through a tumbling maze of scrap steel that pinged and scraped against
the hull like hail on a tin roof. Twice, he had to fire the lateral
thrusters to dodge a piece that was too large to brush off. Once, a
chunk the size of his fist hit the port engine nacelle with a bang that
made him flinch, but the nacelle held, and the engine kept running, and
Jake kept flying.

He cleared the debris field at the forty-two-hour mark, sweating and
wide awake and angrier than he had been in years. Someone had paid good
money to put that junk in his path. Someone with the resources to
calculate his course, transport several tons of scrap metal to a
precise point in deep space, and dump it with enough accuracy to force
him through or around it.

This was not a casual obstruction. This was a contract. Someone wanted
Victor Gale dead, and they were willing to spend serious money to make
sure the pardon arrived too late.

Jake checked his margin. The debris field had cost him an hour and
forty-three minutes. He now had six hours and seventeen minutes of
margin, on a run that still had forty-six hours to go.

It was tight. But Jake Trent had been tight before. He had delivered
mail through solar storms, past pirate ambushes, and around customs
blockades, and he had never missed a deadline. Never. It was the only
thing about himself that he was genuinely proud of, and he was not
about to let some rich bastard with a grudge take it away from him.

He pushed the engines back to maximum, drank the strongest coffee the
ship's dispenser could produce, and flew.

                               IV.

The last forty-six hours were a blur of coffee and course corrections
and the steady, hypnotic glow of the instrument panels in the darkened
cockpit. Jake slept in twenty-minute intervals, the alarm set to wake
him if anything changed. Nothing changed. The outer system was empty —
blessedly, terrifyingly empty — and the Jackrabbit flew through it
like a bullet through a cathedral, small and fast and alone.

At the seventy-hour mark, Pluto appeared on the long-range sensors. A
dim, cold world at the edge of everything, attended by its oversized
moon Charon, where the prison station sat in a geosynchronous orbit
that kept it permanently facing the planet's dark side.

At the eighty-hour mark, Jake raised Charon Station on the radio.

"Charon Station, this is mail courier Jackrabbit, registration Charlie-
Mike-seven-seven-four, inbound with priority delivery. Request
emergency docking clearance."

The response came back with the flat, bored tone of a station
communications officer who had probably not spoken to another ship in
weeks. "Jackrabbit, Charon Station. Emergency docking clearance
granted. Bay Three. Be advised, approach corridor is standard, no
traffic. Welcome to the edge of nowhere."

"Roger, Charon Station. ETA six hours, forty-two minutes."

Six hours and forty-two minutes. The execution was scheduled for the
ninety-six-hour mark. That left him one hour and eighteen minutes of
margin.

It was enough. Barely, ridiculously, absurdly enough, but enough.

Unless something else happened.

Something else happened.

At the eighty-four-hour mark, twelve hours from his deadline and six
from Charon Station, the port engine died.

It did not sputter or cough or give any warning. It simply stopped.
One moment it was running at full thrust, pushing the Jackrabbit toward
Pluto at a speed that would have horrified the ship's original
designers, and the next moment it was silent — a dead weight on the
port side that immediately threw the ship into a slow, sickening yaw.

Jake killed the starboard engine to stop the spin, then restarted it
at half thrust to maintain some forward momentum while he scrambled
to the engine compartment. The port engine's diagnostic panel told the
story: thermal overload in the primary combustion chamber. The ten-
percent over-rating had finally caught up with him. The chamber lining
had cracked, and the fuel injection system had automatically shut down
to prevent an explosion.

Jake stared at the diagnostic readout and did the math. On one engine
at half thrust, his transit time to Charon Station was — he ran the
numbers twice — nine hours. Nine hours, when he had six and change
until the deadline.

He was going to be late. Victor Gale was going to die because Jake
Trent's port engine had given up twelve hours short of the finish line.

Jake stood in the engine compartment and looked at the cracked
combustion chamber and thought about a man he had never met, sitting
in a cell on Charon Station, counting hours.

Then he stopped thinking and started working.

The repair was not elegant. It was not safe. It was the kind of repair
that would have gotten him grounded by any licensing authority in the
inner system: he pulled the cracked chamber lining, replaced it with
a section of hull plating that was approximately the right shape and
entirely the wrong material, sealed the joints with emergency weld
compound, and prayed — actually, literally prayed, which was something
Jake Trent had not done since he was twelve — that the patch would hold
long enough to get him to Charon Station.

The repair took seventy-three minutes. He climbed back into the cockpit,
strapped in, and restarted the port engine.

It held. The thrust was rough — irregular, vibrating, producing a sound
that was less "engine" and more "argument" — but it held. Jake pushed
both engines back to full thrust and pointed the Jackrabbit at Charon.

He had five hours and seven minutes until the deadline, and five hours
and twelve minutes until arrival.

He was five minutes short.

Jake stared at the numbers. Five minutes. After four days of running,
after dodging an interceptor and threading a debris field and patching
an engine with hull plating and prayers, he was going to miss the
deadline by five minutes.

He looked at the throttle. It was already at maximum — rated maximum.
He thought about the mechanic on Ganymede. Ten percent over-rating.
Both engines were already running at a hundred percent, one of them on
a patched combustion chamber that was not designed for the job.

Jake pushed the throttle past the stop.

The Jackrabbit screamed. There was no other word for it — the engines
produced a sound that was part roar and part shriek and part the noise
a machine makes when it is being asked to do something it was not built
to do. The ship shuddered. The instrument panel flickered. The
temperature gauges on both engines climbed into the red.

Jake held the throttle and flew.

                               V.

The Jackrabbit docked at Charon Station at ninety-five hours and
eighteen minutes. Forty-two minutes before the deadline.

Jake didn't wait for the docking clamps to finish cycling. He popped
the hatch, grabbed the briefcase, and launched himself down the
docking tube and into the station's main corridor, running — floating,
really, in Charon's minimal gravity — toward the warden's office with
the briefcase clutched to his chest and his legs churning against the
deck plates.

The warden was a tall, gray-haired woman named Kowalski who looked at
Jake — unshaven, unwashed, wild-eyed, wearing four days' worth of
coffee stains and engine grease — with the expression of someone who
has seen everything and is mildly surprised to discover that there is
one more thing.

"I have a pardon," Jake said. "For Victor Gale. Signed by the governor.
Original document, physical signatures, biometric seals. Frontier
Justice Protocol, Article Seven, Section Three: the execution is
stayed."

Warden Kowalski took the briefcase. She opened it. She examined the
document — carefully, methodically, with the thoroughness of a woman
who understood that a man's life depended on whether the paperwork was
in order.

"It's valid," she said.

Jake's knees gave out. He sat down on the deck of the warden's office,
right there on the cold steel, and put his head in his hands. His
heart was hammering. His hands were shaking. He smelled terrible.

"Mr. Trent."

He looked up. Warden Kowalski was looking at him with something that
was not quite a smile but was closer to one than anything else her face
seemed capable of producing.

"How did you get here from Ceres in ninety-five hours? The best transit
time on record is eighty-seven, and that was a military courier with
new engines."

"I had motivation," Jake said.

"I see that." She picked up her comm unit. "Block D, this is the
warden. Stay the execution of Victor Gale, effective immediately.
Confirmed pardon received. Acknowledge."

The acknowledgment came back. A man's life, confirmed, in four words
over a radio.

Jake sat on the deck and breathed. The station hummed around him —
cold, quiet, the most remote human habitation in the solar system, a
prison on the dark side of a moon at the edge of everything. Outside
the station's walls, Pluto turned, dim and frozen, lit by a sun that
was barely more than a bright star.

He thought about the dark ship in the Belt. The debris field. The
cracked engine. Someone had tried very hard to make sure this pardon
arrived too late, and they had almost succeeded. Five minutes. He had
beaten the deadline by forty-two minutes, but he had been five minutes
short until he pushed the engines past the point of sense and let the
Jackrabbit scream.

Twenty thousand dollars. It was good money. It was more money than
Jake usually saw in four months of legitimate hauling.

But that was not why he had done it.

He had done it because the mail was supposed to get through. That was
the job. That was the covenant between a courier and his cargo. You
took the parcel, you carried it to where it was going, and you did not
let anything stop you — not distance, not danger, not the kind of
people who dumped scrap metal in shipping lanes to keep a man from
getting a pardon.

Jake pulled himself to his feet. He was exhausted, filthy, and his
port engine was probably a write-off. The Jackrabbit was going to need
a month in drydock and more money than the twenty thousand would cover.

He did not care. The mail had gotten through.

"Warden," he said. "Is there somewhere I can get a cup of coffee?"

Kowalski almost smiled. "End of the corridor, Mr. Trent. The coffee
is terrible."

"Ma'am, after four days in the Jackrabbit, I guarantee you it's an
improvement."

He walked down the corridor toward the coffee, and behind him, in a
cell on Block D, a man named Victor Gale learned that he was going to
live, and the universe, which was vast and cold and largely indifferent
to the affairs of mail couriers, was — for the moment — a fraction of
a degree less unjust.

Transportation and a part-time writer whose fiction specializes in the
practical challenges of building things in space. A veteran of the Army
Corps of Engineers with Pacific theater service, he holds an engineering
degree from Ohio State and writes his stories during late-night sessions
in his home in Akron, Ohio. His previous stories for these pages include
"Load-Bearing" (Issue #7) and "Stress Test" (Issue #12). He is married
to Dorothy Mercer, has four sons, and maintains that a story, like a
bridge, must be built to spec. "The Bridge to Forever" is his most
ambitious structure to date.

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO is an ordained Jesuit priest and professor of
philosophy and theology at Loyola University in Baltimore. He writes
science fiction because he believes that imagining the extent of God's
creation is a form of theological inquiry. His first story for these
pages, "The Jesuit's Equation" (Issue #17), was one of the most warmly
received stories we have published. "The Confession Booth" is his second
appearance, and we expect it will provoke as much thoughtful discussion
as his first. He writes slowly, carefully, and with a quiet sense of
humor that surfaces at unexpected moments.

THEODORE CAIN is, by any measure, the most prolific contributor in the
history of this magazine. A former autoworker and current technical
writer for General Motors in Dearborn, Michigan, he has published a
story in nearly every issue since our first, demonstrating a versatility
that is the envy of his peers. "Counterfeit Cosmos" marks his latest
exercise in genre-bending — a mystery wrapped in a xenoarchaeological
enigma. He writes every evening from 8:00 PM to midnight, seven days
a week, and reports that his wife, Jean, has learned to sleep through
the sound of his typewriter.

FRANKLIN HOYT is a journalist and fiction writer based in Washington,
D.C. A graduate of Howard University and a veteran who served in a
segregated Army unit during the war, he brings to his fiction a
journalist's clarity, a preacher's moral authority, and a profound
skepticism about the exercise of power in all its forms. His first
story for these pages, "The Committee" (Issue #14), was the most
politically charged story we have published, and "The Doomsday Caucus"
continues his sustained examination of how nations behave — and
misbehave — under pressure. He is married to civil rights attorney
Barbara Hoyt.

GUNNAR ERIKSSON is a literary translator and fiction writer who lives in
Stockholm, Sweden, and writes in English with a beauty and precision
that puts many native speakers to shame. His generation ship stories —
beginning with "Long Watch" (Issue #16), which prompted an admiring
letter from Ray Bradbury — are among the most distinctive and haunting
work in science fiction. "The Wanderer's Rest" is his finest story for
these pages, a meditation on sacrifice, obsolescence, and the stubborn
persistence of hope. He is married to painter Ingrid Bergstrom, and
they live quietly in Sodermalm.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY learned to write in the pulps, and he has never
apologized for it. A Chicago native who has been writing professional
fiction since 1939, he has published over two hundred stories across
every genre and brings to science fiction the pure, uncut narrative
energy of the old pulp tradition. His stories move fast, his dialogue
crackles, and his heroes are the kind of resourceful, stubborn,
slightly battered men who get the job done no matter what. "Dead Run
to Pluto" is Finley at his best: a chase story so fast you may want
to hold the magazine with both hands. He lives in Rogers Park, Chicago,
with his wife Carol and an indeterminate number of cats.

                         SIGNALS RECEIVED
                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Hal Mercer's "Cantilever" in Issue #18 was the finest piece of
engineering fiction I have read in any magazine. The man understands
load dynamics, and he writes about them with a clarity that makes me
wish my own engineering students could express themselves half as well.
I would, however, note that his calculation of the thermal expansion
coefficient for the carbon nanotube composite appears to assume a
constant temperature gradient, which is unrealistic in the orbital
environment he describes. The actual cycling would produce fatigue
effects that — but I realize I am writing a technical critique rather
than a letter to the editor. Suffice it to say: more Mercer, please.

                              — Dr. Heinrich Baumann

Dear Editor,

Father Aquino's "The Jesuit's Equation" in Issue #17 was a revelation.
I had not believed it possible to write a science fiction story about
faith that took both the science and the faith seriously, without
mocking either one. Father Aquino has done it, and done it beautifully.
I am not a religious man, but I found myself moved by the intelligence
and compassion of his writing. If this is what theology looks like
when it puts on a spacesuit, I want more of it.

                                 Brooklyn, New York

Dear Sterling,

I notice that your July issue contained THREE stories by Theodore Cain,
if you count the one published under his "T.C. Wright" pseudonym, which
everyone in fandom knows about. I am not complaining — Cain is always
readable — but I would gently suggest that the magazine might benefit
from a slightly more varied roster. We cannot ALL be Theodore Cain,
though some months it appears we are trying.

                              — Agnes Planck
                                 Evanston, Illinois

(Miss Planck is correct that "T.C. Wright" is Mr. Cain, a fact that
was supposed to be a secret and lasted approximately one issue. In our
defense, we needed a robot story on short notice, and Mr. Cain delivered
one in eleven days.                                            — M.S.)

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Franklin Hoyt's "The Committee" was a courageous story, and you were
courageous to publish it. In these times, it requires no small amount
of nerve to hold a mirror up to the nation's politics and say, plainly,
"Look at what we are doing." I am a government employee, and I cannot
sign my real name to this letter, which is itself a commentary on the
conditions Mr. Hoyt describes. But I want him to know that his story
was passed, hand to hand, through my office, and that it said what many
of us have been thinking and none of us have been willing to say.

                              — "A Reader in Washington"

We are honored by these letters and grateful for your engagement.
Keep writing!                                                  — M.S.

                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement has produced what may be the purest example of "hard"
science fiction ever written. Set on the planet Mesklin — a disc-shaped
world that rotates so rapidly its surface gravity ranges from three
times Earth's at the equator to nearly seven hundred times at the
poles — the novel follows the voyage of the alien sea captain Barlennan
as he traverses his extraordinary world in search of a stranded human
probe. The science is rigorous to the point of virtuosity: Clement has
worked out the physics of Mesklin in meticulous detail, and the planet
is as fully realized as any world in fiction. If the characters are
somewhat overshadowed by their environment, that is the nature of the
sub-genre, and Barlennan is engaging enough to carry the reader through.
A must for anyone who believes that science fiction should take the
"science" part seriously. Highly recommended.

I AM LEGEND by Richard Matheson
(Gold Medal Books, 1954, $0.25)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Matheson has taken the vampire story — that most venerable of horror
traditions — and subjected it to the rigors of science fiction, with
results that are both chilling and unexpectedly moving. Robert Neville
is the last living man in a world of vampires, and his daily struggle
to survive and his nightly siege against the creatures who were once his
neighbors is told with a spare, relentless intensity that never lets the
reader rest. The ending is a masterpiece of reversal, and I will say no
more about it except that it redefines what we mean by "monster" and
"legend" in ways that stay with you long after the book is closed. An
extraordinary novel that transcends genre. Highest recommendation.

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Dr. Asimov, having established himself as the master of robot fiction
with his landmark story collection, now turns his attention to the
detective novel, and the result is a hugely entertaining hybrid that
marries the mystery genre with his characteristic speculative rigor.
In a future New York City enclosed beneath steel domes, detective Elijah
Baley must solve a murder while partnered with a humanoid robot named
R. Daneel Olivaw — a partnership that forces Baley to confront his own
prejudice against artificial beings. The mystery is well-constructed,
the future society vividly imagined, and the relationship between Baley
and Daneel is one of the most engaging partnerships in recent science
fiction. If the resolution relies somewhat heavily on Asimov's Laws of
Robotics, that is a minor quibble in a thoroughly satisfying novel.
Recommended with enthusiasm.
