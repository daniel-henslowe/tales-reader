TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

We write this letter in September 1965, and the world outside our
editorial offices on East Fifty-First Street is not the world we knew
when this magazine first appeared twelve years ago. Nor, frankly, is
the world inside them.

In March, three thousand people marched from Selma to Montgomery. In
June, Alexei Leonov floated untethered in the vacuum of space. On
campuses from Berkeley to Columbia, a generation is asking questions
that their parents believed were settled. The Voting Rights Act has
become law. The first American combat troops are in Vietnam. Bob Dylan
has plugged in an electric guitar. The pill is reshaping the most
intimate dimensions of private life. Everywhere one looks, the
certainties of a decade ago are dissolving, and what is emerging in
their place is not yet clear.

What is clear is that the question of identity — who we are, who we
are permitted to be, who we might choose to become — has moved from
the margins of intellectual conversation to its white-hot center. It
is no longer an abstract philosophical puzzle. It is the lived
experience of millions: the black citizen who insists on full
personhood, the woman who refuses the role assigned to her, the young
man who questions whether his nation's cause is just, the scientist
who wonders whether the tools she has built will liberate or destroy.
The question of who we are is becoming the question of who we might
choose to become.

Science fiction, we have always believed, is the literature best
equipped to explore such questions — not because it provides answers,
but because it provides the laboratory conditions under which questions
can be tested. What happens to identity when the body is modified?
When memory is edited? When time itself becomes non-linear? When the
self encounters something so radically other that the categories of
selfhood no longer apply?

This issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond is our attempt to
conduct that experiment across six very different stories. Julian St.
Croix offers a murder mystery in which time flows in both directions
and the murderer and victim are the same person — a story whose
structure is as inventive as anything we have published. Elaine Prescott
documents the progressive transformation of a human being into
something else, in a journal that charts the dissolution of the
journalist as precisely as the construction of the posthuman. Theodore
Cain gives us a society that has learned to edit its own memory, and a
clandestine group that insists on remembering. Dolores Reyes tells the
story of an alien who has lived so long as human that the distinction
has lost its meaning — or has it? Dr. Vincent Koslov builds a machine
that predicts the future with perfect accuracy, and discovers that the
most probable future is the one nobody wants. And Zara Nix — enigmatic,
unclassifiable Zara Nix — offers a fragmented, kaleidoscopic account of
first contact as pure sensation.

Six stories. Six transformations. We do not pretend they will answer
the questions that keep us awake at night. But we believe they will
sharpen those questions, and in this time of upheaval, sharper questions
may be the most useful thing a magazine can offer.

One housekeeping note: we are delighted to announce that beginning with
issue #60, our rates increase to five cents a word on acceptance. We
want the best stories being written, and we intend to pay for them. New
writers, established names, voices we have never heard — send us your
manuscripts.

The future is not what it was. Neither are we. And that, we believe,
is cause for hope.

Yours in transformation,

                      PALINDROME CONSPIRACY

                      by Julian St. Croix

================================================================================

                            I.

The murder has already happened. The murder has not yet occurred.

Inspector Maren Voss understood both of these statements to be true
simultaneously, which was the particular gift and particular curse of
anyone who had undergone the Janus modification — the neural
restructuring that permitted human consciousness to perceive time in
both its customary direction and its reverse, the way a reader of
certain ancient languages might scan a text from left to right and from
right to left at once, each reading yielding a different poem from the
same arrangement of letters.

She stood in the observatory of the Chronometric Bureau, a great glass
dome perched atop the Ministry of Temporal Affairs in what had once been
called London and was now called, with the deadpan bureaucratic humor
that characterized all governmental nomenclature in the Modified Era,
Anchor Point Seven. The city spread beneath her in two directions that
were not spatial but temporal: forward, into the fog and neon of
September 14th, 2189, the rain-streaked towers dissolving into the
probabilistic haze of the not-yet; and backward, into the crystallized
amber of the already-was, every moment from this one to the dim
prehistory of unmodified time laid out like a corridor of mirrors
reflecting mirrors, each image slightly smaller, slightly less distinct,
but unmistakably present.

The body lay on the floor of the observatory. Or rather: the body
would lie on the floor of the observatory. The tenses were impossible,
as they always were in Janus cases, and the Bureau had long since
abandoned the pretense of grammatical coherence in its official reports,
substituting instead a symbolic notation that represented temporal
direction with arrows and simultaneity with a bracket that Voss had
always thought resembled an open mouth, frozen in the act of saying
something that could never be unsaid.

"The victim," said Luken Strand, her partner, who had not undergone
Janus modification and who therefore experienced time in the quaint,
monodirectional fashion of the unmodified — forward, always forward,
like a man walking down a corridor who cannot turn his head — "the
victim is Dr. Cassia Lorne. Age forty-seven. Senior researcher at the
Institute for Palindromic Studies."

"Is," said Voss. "Was. Will be."

"Let's stick with 'is,' shall we?"

Voss knelt beside the body. Dr. Cassia Lorne lay on her back, her eyes
open, her expression one of — and here Voss's Janus perception
complicated matters enormously — surprise and resignation and something
that looked very much like recognition, as though the face she had seen
at the moment of death (which was also, Voss now understood with a
nauseating lurch of doubled consciousness, the moment of birth of
something else) had been a face she knew. Her own face.

"The palindromic signature," Voss said, more to herself than to Strand.
"Tell me it's not what I think it is."

Strand consulted his instruments — old-fashioned, monodirectional
instruments that could only read the temporal residue left behind by
events that had already occurred, like a geologist reading the rings of
a fossilized tree. "The event has a perfect palindromic signature. The
temporal energy pattern reads the same forward and backward. Which
means —"

"Which means the killer and the victim exist at palindromic points on
the same timeline." Voss closed her eyes. In the forward direction, she
saw Dr. Lorne's future: a flatline, the abrupt cessation of all
temporal extension, the event-horizon of death beyond which nothing
could be perceived. In the backward direction, she saw Dr. Lorne's
past: a life lived in the usual monodirectional fashion until six years
ago, when Lorne had undergone the Janus modification and become, like
Voss, a creature of two temporal directions — and there, six years back,
a strange echo, a resonance, as if the life were a bell that had been
struck and was still ringing, and the ringing, if one listened very
carefully, formed a pattern that was the same forwards and backwards.

A palindrome. A life that read the same in both directions.

Which meant that somewhere, at the other end of that palindromic
pattern, was a person who was Cassia Lorne and was not Cassia Lorne —
the same consciousness at a different point on the same curve, the
way the letter A at the beginning of the word ABRACADABRA is and is
not the same letter A at its end.

"The killer," Voss said, opening her eyes, "is Dr. Cassia Lorne."

"That's impossible," said Strand. "She's the victim."

"Yes," said Voss. "That's what makes it a palindrome."

                            II.

Six years before the murder (which was also six years after the murder,
depending on which direction you were reading), Dr. Cassia Lorne sat
in the waiting room of the Janus Clinic, filling out the final consent
forms for neural modification, and experienced, for what she believed
was the last time, the simple, uncomplicated sensation of not knowing
what was going to happen next.

The waiting room was aggressively ordinary: beige walls, institutional
chairs, a table with magazines that were precisely three months out
of date, as if the clinic wished to reassure its clients that some
things, at least, were reliably, boringly, monodirectionally temporal.
A potted fern sat in the corner, its fronds curling in one direction
only. Cassia found herself staring at it with the intensity of someone
memorizing the face of a lover she was about to leave.

She was thirty-eight years old. She was a researcher at the Institute
for Palindromic Studies, which had been established five years earlier
to investigate the mathematical properties of events that exhibited
temporal symmetry — events whose causal structure was identical whether
read forward or backward, like a sentence that spelled the same word
in both directions. The Institute had begun as an obscure corner of
theoretical physics, but the discovery that certain quantum events
possessed genuine palindromic properties — that some things really did
happen the same way in both temporal directions, that the universe
contained structures which were, at the deepest level, symmetrical in
time — had elevated the field from curiosity to urgency.

Cassia had spent her career studying these structures. She had published
the definitive paper on palindromic resonance in closed timelike curves.
She had mapped the temporal topography of seventeen confirmed
palindromic events. And she had come, slowly and with increasing
certainty, to a conclusion that terrified her: that the Janus
modification, which had been marketed as a simple perceptual enhancement
— the ability to see backward as well as forward, the way an owl can
rotate its head to see what is behind it — was in fact something far
more dangerous. It did not merely allow one to perceive time in both
directions. It embedded the modified consciousness within the
palindromic structure of time itself, making the perceiver part of the
pattern, the reader part of the text, the observer inseparable from the
observed.

And palindromes, as she knew better than anyone, had a property that
made them fundamentally different from ordinary sequences: they
converged. The beginning and the end moved toward each other. The first
letter and the last letter were the same letter. The opening note and
the closing note were the same note, played in different octaves.

If a consciousness became palindromic, then the person at the beginning
of the pattern and the person at the end of the pattern were, in some
deep and inescapable sense, the same person. And the pattern, by its
nature, had a center — a point of convergence, a fulcrum, a moment
where the forward-moving self and the backward-moving self met.

What happened at that center point?

That was the question that had brought her to the Janus Clinic. Not
because she wanted the modification — she was, in fact, deeply
frightened of it — but because the only way to study a palindromic
consciousness was from within. The instrument and the phenomenon were
the same thing. You could not observe a palindrome from outside without
collapsing it into an ordinary sequence. You had to become the
palindrome to understand it.

"Dr. Lorne?" The nurse appeared in the doorway, smiling the bright,
professional smile of someone who escorted people across irreversible
thresholds for a living. "We're ready for you."

Cassia looked one more time at the fern. Its fronds curled in one
direction only. She envied it.

She stood and walked forward. Only forward. For the last time.

                            III.

Inspector Voss moved through the crime scene in two directions at once,
which was, she had often reflected, rather like trying to read two
novels simultaneously by holding one in each hand and alternating
sentences — except that the novels were written in the same language
about the same characters and the same events, and yet they told
entirely different stories, because the order in which things were
revealed changed everything about what they meant.

Forward: the body, the forensic team, the sterile click of instruments,
the slow accumulation of evidence. A woman dead on the floor of an
observatory. Cause of death: neural cascade failure — the sudden,
catastrophic collapse of a Janus-modified nervous system, as if every
neuron in the brain had fired simultaneously in both temporal
directions and the resulting interference pattern had simply erased the
signal. It was a death unique to the modified, and it was not, in
itself, uncommon. Janus modification carried risks. The human brain had
evolved to process time in one direction; forcing it to process two
directions simultaneously created stresses that occasionally, and
without warning, proved fatal.

But the palindromic signature made it murder. A natural neural cascade
failure produced a random temporal energy pattern — noise, chaos, the
meaningless static of a system collapsing. This collapse was not
random. It was symmetrical. It was structured. It read the same forward
and backward, which meant it had been caused — engineered, designed,
composed — by a consciousness that was itself palindromic, a mind that
could think in both directions and had used that ability to construct
a lethal pattern and insert it into Dr. Lorne's neural architecture
with the precision of a surgeon and the elegance of a poet.

Backward: Voss saw the observatory not as a crime scene but as a
destination — a place that Dr. Lorne had been moving toward for six
years, drawn by a logic that was only visible from the reverse
direction. She saw the threads of causation not converging on this
moment but radiating from it, backward, into the past that was also
the future, and each thread told a piece of the story:

Thread one: Dr. Lorne's research, her six years of work on palindromic
consciousness, her deepening understanding of what it meant to be a
mind that existed in two temporal directions at once.

Thread two: Dr. Lorne's correspondence with a person identified in
Bureau records only as "the Mirror" — a colleague, a collaborator, an
adversary? The letters were palindromic in structure, each one readable
in both directions, each one saying something different depending on
which way you read it.

Thread three: Dr. Lorne's visits to the observatory, once a month,
always at the same time, always alone. What was she looking at? The
stars did not move differently in different temporal directions; they
burned the same way forward and backward, indifferent to the direction
of the arrow. So it was not the stars she was observing. It was
something else. Something that could only be seen from this specific
point in space at this specific point in time, and only by a mind that
could look in both directions at once.

"The Mirror," Voss said to Strand. "Who is the Mirror?"

Strand consulted the Bureau's files — monodirectional files, indexed
by date, proceeding from past to present in the orderly fashion of the
unmodified world. "Unknown. The correspondence was found in Dr. Lorne's
personal archive after — well, after. The letters are encrypted with a
palindromic cipher. Cryptography is working on it, but they say it
could take months. The cipher key appears to be the content of the
letters themselves — you need to read them to decode them, but you
need to decode them to read them."

"A palindromic paradox."

"Cryptography's term was 'a real pain in the arse,' but yes."

Voss smiled, which she did rarely and never when she meant it. Her
Janus perception was showing her something that Strand's monodirectional
files could not: that the correspondence with the Mirror had not begun
six years ago, when Dr. Lorne underwent the Janus modification. It had
begun six years from now — or rather, it had begun at both points
simultaneously, because the Mirror, like Lorne, was a palindromic
consciousness, and their correspondence existed at both ends of the
pattern at once, like two people starting at opposite ends of a bridge
and meeting in the middle.

And the middle was here. The observatory. September 14th, 2189. The
point of convergence. The center of the palindrome.

"Strand," Voss said, "I need to tell you something, and I need you to
believe me even though it will sound insane."

"I work temporal homicide. My baseline for insane is already quite
high."

"The Mirror is Cassia Lorne."

Strand blinked. "The victim is corresponding with herself?"

"The victim is corresponding with a version of herself that is moving
through the palindrome in the opposite direction. Think of it this way:
when Lorne underwent the Janus modification, her consciousness became
palindromic. It began to exist in both temporal directions
simultaneously. But a palindrome has two halves — the forward half and
the backward half — and while they are mirror images of each other,
they are not identical in experience. The Cassia Lorne moving forward
through the palindrome is accumulating experiences in the usual order:
she remembers the past, she anticipates the future. The Cassia Lorne
moving backward through the palindrome is accumulating experiences in
the reverse order: she remembers the future, she anticipates the past."

"That's — "

"Disorienting, yes. And over time, the two halves diverge. They start
as the same person, but they accumulate different experiences, different
memories, different — selves. By the time they reach the center point,
the point where the palindrome converges, they are the same person and
they are not the same person. They are the same letter at the beginning
and end of a word that has, in the intervening syllables, changed its
meaning entirely."

Strand looked at the body on the floor. "And when they meet?"

"When they meet," Voss said, "one of them dies. Because a palindrome
can only have one center. The convergence point is singular. Two
versions of the same consciousness cannot occupy the same point on the
same timeline. One must collapse. One must be — " She searched for the
word. " — overwritten."

"So the murder — "

"Is not a murder. It is a convergence. The forward-moving Cassia Lorne
and the backward-moving Cassia Lorne have been approaching this moment
from opposite directions for six years, and when they met — here, in
this observatory, at the center of their shared palindrome — the
interference pattern between them destroyed one of them. The one that
survived is the one that is, from our forward-moving perspective, dead.
Because the survivor is moving backward. She has already left. She is
retreating into the past, into the half of the palindrome that, from
our perspective, has already been lived."

Strand sat down heavily on the observatory bench. "So the killer is
gone."

"The killer was never here. Not from our direction. She was here from
the other direction, and she has already — or will already — or — "
Voss pressed her fingers to her temples. The grammar of palindromic
events was a migraine in linguistic form. "The backward-moving Cassia
Lorne experienced this moment as a beginning, not an ending. She was
born here, in the same instant that the forward-moving Cassia Lorne
died. She opened her eyes for the first time in the same moment that
her other self closed hers for the last time. And she has gone — is
going — will have gone — backward, into the six years of palindromic
time that, from our perspective, have already elapsed."

"She's living Lorne's life in reverse."

"She's living a life that is the mirror image of Lorne's life. The
same events, but experienced in the opposite order, and therefore
meaning entirely different things. The divorce that was, for the
forward-moving Lorne, an ending, will be, for the backward-moving
Lorne, a beginning. The research breakthrough that was, forward, a
triumph of understanding, will be, backward, a process of progressive
forgetting — of unlearning what she knew, losing the insights she had
gained, returning to a state of ignorance that she will experience as
a kind of innocence."

"And at the end? When she reaches the beginning of the palindrome —
the moment when Lorne first underwent the Janus modification?"

Voss closed her eyes. In the backward direction, she could see it: a
shape at the far end of the corridor of mirrors, a figure moving toward
the Janus Clinic with the unhurried pace of someone who knows exactly
where she is going because she has already been there, because she is
always already there, because in a palindrome the beginning and the end
are the same place and the journey between them is the same journey
regardless of which direction you walk.

"At the end," Voss said, "she will sit in a waiting room. She will look
at a fern. She will stand up, and walk forward — only forward, for the
first time — and she will undergo the Janus modification, and she will
become, again, a palindromic consciousness, and the whole pattern will
begin again."

"A loop."

"A palindrome. It reads the same in both directions. It has no
beginning and no end. It has only a center, and the center is here.
This room. This moment. This death, which is also a birth. This murder,
which is also a creation."

                            IV.

Three years before the convergence — three years into her Janus-
modified existence — Cassia Lorne sat in her office at the Institute
for Palindromic Studies and wrote a letter to herself.

Not a diary entry. Not a memorandum. A letter, addressed to a specific
recipient, sealed in an envelope, stamped, and mailed to a post office
box that she had rented under the name "The Mirror" — a name she had
chosen because it was, she felt, the most honest description of the
entity she was writing to: a reflection of herself, reversed, moving in
the opposite direction, seeing everything she saw but from the other
side.

She had been writing these letters for three years, or she had been
writing them for three years in the other direction; it depended on
your perspective, and perspective was, she had come to understand, the
only thing that mattered. The same event, seen from two directions,
was two different events. The same person, moving through the same
life in two directions, was two different people. This was not
metaphor. This was not philosophy. This was the lived, empirical,
neurologically verifiable reality of palindromic consciousness, and it
was slowly driving her mad.

Or not mad. Transformed. The distinction was increasingly difficult to
maintain.

Dear Mirror, she wrote.

I have been thinking about the nature of conspiracy. The word comes from
the Latin "conspirare" — to breathe together. A conspiracy is not a
plot or a scheme; it is an act of shared respiration, two sets of lungs
filling and emptying in synchrony, two chests rising and falling to
the same rhythm. We are conspiring, you and I. We are breathing
together. I exhale and you inhale; you exhale and I inhale. The air
between us is the palindrome itself — the shared medium through which
we exchange the substance of our existence.

I wonder if you are reading this letter at the same moment I am writing
it, or at a different moment that is, from your perspective, the same
moment. I wonder if you are writing me a letter at this very instant,
a letter I will receive three years from now, which is also three years
ago. I wonder if your letter will contain the answers to questions I
have not yet thought to ask, and if my letter contains the answers to
questions you have already forgotten.

I have been studying the convergence point. I know now what happens at
the center of the palindrome. I know that one of us will not survive
it. And here is what terrifies me: I do not know which one. From your
direction, I am the one who dies and you are the one who is born. From
my direction, you are the intruder, the usurper, the backward-moving
ghost who will replace me at the moment of my destruction. We are both
the murderer and the victim. We are both the beginning and the end. We
are both the same letter, the same note, the same breath — and the
palindrome does not care which of us it keeps and which it discards,
because to the palindrome, we are the same.

I am frightened, Mirror. I am frightened of you, who are me. I am
frightened of the center, which is where we meet. I am frightened of
convergence, which is another word for annihilation, which is another
word for birth.

Write me back. Tell me it will be all right. Tell me in the language
we share, which reads the same in both directions, which means the
same thing regardless of the order in which the words are spoken.

Tell me a palindrome, Mirror. Tell me a word that does not change
when you reverse it.

Yours,
Cassia

She sealed the letter. She mailed it. She went home to an apartment
that was, she realized with a vertiginous doubling of perception, also
the apartment where her mirror-self was, at this very moment (or at
this very moment's temporal reflection), unsealing a letter and reading
it for the first time, or for the last time, or for the only time —
because in a palindrome, first and last are the same, and the only time
is all the time there is.

                            V.

"I want to see the letters," Voss told Strand.

They were in the Bureau's evidence room, a vast subterranean archive
where temporal artifacts were stored in chronostatic fields that
prevented them from aging in either direction — a necessary precaution
in a world where some evidence was getting younger even as the
investigation that required it was getting older.

Strand produced a box. Inside were twenty-six letters — thirteen
written by the forward-moving Cassia Lorne to the Mirror, and thirteen
written by the Mirror to Cassia Lorne, and it was only when Voss held
them up to her Janus perception that she understood: they were the same
thirteen letters. Each letter, read forward, was Cassia's letter to the
Mirror. Each letter, read backward — the sentences reversed, the
paragraphs inverted, the whole architecture of the communication
reflected as in a glass — was the Mirror's letter to Cassia. The same
text. The same words. The same ink on the same paper. Two letters in
one, a correspondence that was also a monologue, a dialogue that was
also a soliloquy, a conspiracy of one person breathing with herself.

Voss read the letters. She read them forward and she read them backward,
and in each direction they told a different story — the same story,
but different — and the difference was everything.

Forward, the letters charted a journey from curiosity to understanding
to terror. Cassia Lorne, moving through time in the ordinary direction,
discovered the nature of palindromic consciousness, realized that it
implied convergence, understood that convergence meant the destruction
of one half of the palindromic self, and spent her final months — her
final letters — grappling with the knowledge that she was walking
toward her own annihilation and could not stop, because the palindrome
was not a choice she had made but a structure she had become, and you
could not step out of a structure that was your own consciousness any
more than you could step out of your own skeleton.

Backward, the letters charted a different journey. The Mirror — the
backward-moving Cassia, born at the convergence point, retreating into
a past she experienced as a future — wrote letters of discovery, of
wonder, of the strange joy of experiencing a life in reverse. What had
been, for the forward-moving Cassia, the familiar routine of daily
existence was, for the Mirror, a landscape of perpetual novelty: every
sunset was a first sunrise; every farewell was a first greeting; every
loss was a discovery. The Mirror's letters were exuberant, playful,
shot through with the giddy energy of someone for whom the world is
endlessly new because she is moving through it in the wrong direction.

And at the center of the correspondence — letter seven of thirteen,
the fulcrum, the convergence — was a single sheet of paper on which
was written a single word:

MADAM.

A palindrome. A word that reads the same in both directions. A word
that is its own mirror. A word that is, in English, a term of formal
address for a woman, and which is also, when you look at it long enough,
a kind of scream frozen in typographical form — the mouth opening on M,
widening through A and D, reaching its maximum aperture at the central
A, and then closing again, D and A and M, the same scream in reverse,
the same cry, the same breath, inhaled and exhaled, the same woman at
the beginning and the end, and in the middle, at the center, at the
convergence point, the moment of maximum openness, the instant when
the mouth is widest and the sound is loudest and the self is most
fully extended —

Nothing. Silence. The palindrome's center is not a climax but an
absence. The point where the two halves meet is the point where
neither half exists. It is the space between the mirrors, the gap
in the reflection, the breath between the inhale and the exhale when
the lungs are neither filling nor emptying but simply, for one
impossible instant, still.

Voss put down the letters. Her hands were shaking.

"It wasn't murder," she said again, and this time the word had a
different weight, a different meaning, because she had read the letters
and she understood now what had happened in the observatory, not as
a detective understanding a crime but as a Janus-modified consciousness
understanding a palindrome — from inside, from both directions at once,
the way the only way to understand a mirror is to stand in front of it
and accept that the face looking back at you is yours and is not yours
and is yours.

"It was a conspiracy," she said. "In the original sense. Two people
breathing together. Except the two people were the same person, and
the breathing was the palindrome itself — the forward breath and the
backward breath, the inhale and the exhale, the life and the death.
Cassia Lorne and the Mirror conspired. They breathed together. They met
at the center of their shared existence, and at that meeting, one of
them stopped breathing so that the other could begin."

"Which one?" Strand asked. "Which one survived?"

And Voss laughed — a strange, raw sound, because she understood now that
the question was meaningless, the way asking which end of a palindrome
is the real end is meaningless, the way asking which reflection in an
infinite corridor of mirrors is the real reflection is meaningless.
They both survived. They both died. They were the same person, and the
palindrome continued, and would continue, and had always continued, and
the murder that had brought her here was not a crime but a grammar — the
inevitable, symmetrical, beautiful, terrible grammar of a life that
reads the same in both directions.

                            VI.

Voss wrote her report.

She wrote it forward, in the monodirectional language of the Bureau,
because the report was for Strand and for the Bureau's files and for
the legal system that existed in forward-moving time and required
events to proceed from cause to effect in an orderly fashion,
regardless of whether the events themselves obeyed that requirement.

CASE #2189-7734: DEATH OF DR. CASSIA LORNE

Finding: No crime has been committed.

Dr. Cassia Lorne, a Janus-modified researcher specializing in
palindromic temporal structures, died on September 14, 2189, in the
observatory of the Chronometric Bureau, of neural cascade failure
induced by palindromic convergence — the meeting of two
temporally opposed aspects of her own consciousness at the
mathematical center of a palindromic life-pattern.

The death was not caused by an external agent. The palindromic
signature detected at the scene is not evidence of homicide but
of structural inevitability: a palindromic consciousness, by its
nature, converges, and convergence, by its nature, is fatal to
one temporal aspect of the converging self.

No suspect is sought. No prosecution is recommended. The case is
closed.

She signed the report. She filed it. She walked to the window of her
office and looked out at Anchor Point Seven, the city that had been
London, and she saw it in both directions — forward into the rain
and the neon and the not-yet, backward into the amber and the crystal
and the already-was — and she thought about Cassia Lorne, who had
walked into a clinic six years ago and become a palindrome, and who
had spent six years discovering what that meant, and who had met
herself at the center of her own existence and had been destroyed and
created in the same instant, and who was now — depending on your
direction — either gone forever or just beginning.

And she thought about her own Janus modification, which she had
undergone eleven years ago, which meant that she was eleven years into
her own palindrome, which meant that somewhere, eleven years from now
(or eleven years ago, depending), her own Mirror was moving toward her,
accumulating its own experiences, writing its own letters, breathing
in the opposite direction, and that one day (or one day ago) they
would meet, she and her Mirror, at the center of their shared
palindrome, in some room, at some moment, and one of them would stop
and the other would begin, and it would not be murder and it would not
be suicide and it would not be birth and it would not be death, it
would be grammar, the grammar of a life that reads the same in both
directions —

And she wondered, standing at the window, looking forward and backward
at once, which one she was. The one walking toward the center, or the
one walking away from it. The one who would die at the convergence, or
the one who would be born there. The original or the reflection. The
first letter or the last.

But of course, she realized, closing her eyes and letting the two
directions of time wash over her like two tides meeting on a shoreline,
it did not matter. In a palindrome, the first letter and the last
letter are the same letter. The question of which one you are is the
one question that a palindrome, by its very nature, cannot answer —
because the answer, like everything else, reads the same in both
directions.

She opened her eyes. She went home. She walked in one direction, the
way everyone walks in one direction, the way even a palindromic
consciousness, trapped in a body that is stubbornly monodirectional,
must move through the physical world: one step, then another, then
another, forward, always forward, even though the mind inside is
reading the story from both ends simultaneously and knows that the
ending and the beginning are the same page.

At home, she found a letter in her mailbox.

It was addressed in her own handwriting.

She opened it. Inside was a single sheet of paper, and on the paper,
in her own hand, was written a single word:

MADAM.

She read it forward. She read it backward. It said the same thing.

Maren Voss, Inspector of Temporal Homicide, Janus-modified, palindromic,
a woman whose consciousness extended in two directions from a center
she had not yet reached and had already passed, held the letter in both
hands and breathed — in and out, forward and backward, the same breath,
the same word, the same woman at the beginning and the end — and
understood, at last, that the conspiracy was not Cassia Lorne's alone.

It was everyone's. Every Janus-modified consciousness. Every palindromic
life. Every mind that had been opened to the terrible, beautiful,
symmetrical truth that time is not a line but a word, and the word
reads the same in both directions, and the reader and the word are the
same, and the reading is the writing is the reading, and the murder is
the birth is the murder, and the conspiracy — the shared breathing,
the conspirare, the two lungs filling and emptying in synchrony — is
the palindrome itself, which is life itself, which is —

She folded the letter. She put it in her pocket. She sat down in her
chair and closed her eyes and breathed, forward and backward, the same
breath, and waited for the center, which was coming and had already
come and was always, always, already here.

                     MODIFICATION JOURNAL
                     Subject: MARSH, ELEANOR V.
                     Protocol: Cascade Enhancement Series
                     Clearance: Level 7, Institute for Human Futures

ENTRY 1 — JANUARY 3

My name is Eleanor Vera Marsh. I am thirty-four years old. I hold a
doctorate in cognitive neuroscience from MIT and a secondary degree in
biomedical engineering from Johns Hopkins. I am five feet seven inches
tall. My eyes are brown. I am left-handed. I prefer coffee to tea,
silence to music, and precision to ambiguity. I have a scar on my left
knee from a bicycle accident at age nine. I dislike the taste of
cilantro. I am afraid of deep water.

I am recording these facts because I have been advised that they may
become relevant. The Cascade Enhancement protocol involves a series of
progressive cybernetic modifications — twelve in total, administered at
two-week intervals over a six-month period — that will progressively
augment my sensory, cognitive, and physical capabilities. The
modifications are irreversible. Each one will change something about the
way I process information, experience sensation, or interact with the
physical world, and the cumulative effect, according to the protocol
documentation, will be "a fundamental reorganization of the human
experiential framework."

I asked Dr. Osei, the project director, what that meant in plain
language. He said: "You will become something else."

I asked him what, specifically.

He said: "That is what we are trying to find out."

I am the first human subject in the Cascade Enhancement Series. This
journal is required by the protocol: a continuous, first-person record
of subjective experience during the modification process, to be
maintained by the subject for the duration of the series. I have been
instructed to record everything — sensations, thoughts, emotional
states, changes in perception, changes in cognition, changes in desire,
changes in identity. I have been told that this record may be the most
valuable scientific document to emerge from the project, because it will
capture something that no external observation can: the experience of
transformation from the inside.

I am writing this in my apartment, at my desk, with a pen, on paper.
I chose these tools deliberately. The modifications will eventually
include cognitive-digital interfaces that will allow me to record
thoughts directly, without the intermediary of language. But for now, I
want the friction of the pen, the resistance of the paper, the slow,
deliberate, monstrously inefficient process of converting thought into
words. I want to feel myself thinking. I want to remember what it was
like to be slow.

Tomorrow I undergo the first modification: enhanced visual processing.
My optical nerves will be augmented with synthetic fiber bundles that
will extend my visual range into the infrared and ultraviolet spectra
and increase my resolution to approximately fifteen times normal human
acuity. I will see things I have never seen before. I will see things
no human being has ever seen before.

I am not frightened. I am a scientist. This is an experiment, and I am
both the experimenter and the subject, and the purpose of the experiment
is knowledge, and knowledge is worth the cost.

My name is Eleanor Vera Marsh. I want that written down.

ENTRY 2 — JANUARY 5

The first modification is complete. I can see.

That sentence is inadequate. It is like saying "the ocean is wet." It
conveys the basic fact while missing the magnitude entirely.

I can see the individual threads in the weave of my bedsheet. I can see
the crystalline structure of the frost on my window — each crystal
distinct, each branch and sub-branch of the dendritic pattern resolved
with a clarity that makes me want to weep, because it is so beautiful,
so intricate, so astonishingly, overwhelmingly present. I have looked
at frost a thousand times. I have never seen it before.

And the colors. The spectrum has expanded in both directions. Below
red, I now perceive a deep, thrumming warmth that I have no word for —
it is not a color in any vocabulary I possess, it is a new primary, a
foundational hue that has always been there and that I have been blind
to for thirty-four years. Above violet, there is a sharp, singing
brightness that feels less like color and more like sound — a high,
clear note that emanates from certain surfaces, certain materials,
certain angles of light. My apartment is a different place. The walls
are the same walls, but they are broadcasting information they have
always broadcast, and I am only now equipped to receive it.

I looked at myself in the mirror this morning. My eyes have changed.
The irises are the same brown, but there are structures visible within
them now — radial patterns, concentric rings, microscopic striations —
that I have never seen in any human eye, including my own. I am looking
at myself with a resolution that no human being has ever applied to
their own reflection, and what I am seeing is not the face I know. It
is the face I have always had, perceived at a level of detail that
renders it unfamiliar.

I am the same person. The modification is perceptual, not cognitive. My
thoughts are the same thoughts. My preferences are the same preferences.
I still prefer coffee to tea. I still dislike cilantro. I am still
afraid of deep water. I am still Eleanor Vera Marsh.

But the world I live in has changed, and a person is not separable from
the world they perceive. The Eleanor Marsh who lives in a world of
fifteen-times resolution and an extended color spectrum is, in some
sense that I cannot yet articulate, a different Eleanor Marsh than the
one who lived in the ordinary visible range.

The same person. A different person. Both true. The scar on my left
knee is still there. I can see it in extraordinary detail.

ENTRY 3 — JANUARY 20

Second modification: enhanced auditory processing.

I can hear my own heartbeat without a stethoscope. I can hear the
electrical hum of the wiring in the walls. I can hear, when I press
my ear to the window, the conversations of people on the street four
floors below — not as a blur of sound but as distinct, individual
voices, each one separable, each one clear.

I can hear a frequency I have never heard before. It is very high,
above the range of unmodified human hearing, and it is everywhere. It
took me a full day to identify it: it is the sound of my own nervous
system. The electrical activity of my neurons, the firing of synapses,
the constant, ceaseless chatter of electrochemical signals that
constitutes thought itself. I am hearing myself think.

It is not what I expected. I expected something orderly — a clean,
digital hum, the sound of a well-functioning machine. Instead, it is
chaotic, layered, polyphonic — a dense, complex music that sounds like
nothing so much as a forest at night, a thousand creatures calling to
each other in a thousand different registers, and the overall effect is
not mechanical but organic, not designed but evolved, not a computer
but an ecology.

I have been lying awake at night listening to myself think. It is
addictive. It is the most intimate experience I have ever had — more
intimate than sex, more intimate than prayer, more intimate than the
moments of near-drowning in childhood that gave me my fear of deep
water. It is the experience of being inside my own mind, not as a
metaphor but as a literal acoustic environment, and the mind I am
inside is vast and wild and largely unmapped, and I am its first
explorer.

I notice that I have stopped writing about "Eleanor Marsh" and begun
writing about "I." This may not be significant. It may be a simple
shift in journalistic convention. But I note it because the protocol
instructs me to note everything, and because there is a difference
between recording the experiences of a subject named Eleanor Marsh and
recording my own experiences, and I am not entirely sure when the shift
occurred.

ENTRY 4 — FEBRUARY 3

Third modification: enhanced tactile sensitivity.

I can feel the grain of the wood in my desk through my fingertips. Not
the surface texture — the internal structure. The growth rings, the
density variations, the molecular architecture of cellulose and lignin.
My fingers are reading the history of the tree that became this desk:
its years of growth, its seasons of drought and plenty, the direction
of the prevailing wind when it was alive. I am touching a biography.

I can feel the air against my skin as a complex, detailed, constantly
shifting tactile environment. Temperature gradients. Humidity
differentials. The movement of currents created by the heating system,
by my own body heat, by the opening and closing of doors in other
rooms. I can feel the pressure of atmospheric changes that precede
weather fronts by hours. My skin has become a barometer, a
thermometer, a hygrometer, an anemometer. My skin has become an
instrument.

Sexual sensation has changed. I will record this because the protocol
requires it. Touch is different now. More intense does not capture it.
More detailed, more differentiated, more specific. I can feel individual
nerve endings activating in sequence, can map the propagation of
sensation from the point of contact outward in concentric waves, can
distinguish between categories of pleasure that were previously blurred
into a single undifferentiated experience. I do not know whether this
is better or worse. It is different. It is more.

Dr. Osei asked me today whether I still feel like myself. I said yes.
He asked me to elaborate. I said that I still have the same memories,
the same knowledge, the same values, the same name. He nodded and made
a note and asked me to define "myself" without reference to memories,
knowledge, values, or name. I could not. He made another note.

I notice that my handwriting has changed. The pen feels different in my
enhanced fingers — I am aware of its weight distribution, its center of
gravity, the microscopic imperfections in the barrel, the viscosity of
the ink, the coefficient of friction between nib and paper. My letters
are smaller, more precise, more controlled. They do not look like my
handwriting. They look like the handwriting of someone who can feel
the paper at a molecular level.

ENTRY 5 — FEBRUARY 17

Fourth modification: cognitive acceleration.

I am thinking faster. This sentence, which you will read at the pace of
ordinary language, was composed in approximately one-tenth the time it
would have taken me before the modification. The gap between thought and
expression, which I have always experienced as negligible, has become
an abyss. I think ten things in the time it takes to write one. The
pen, which I chose for its friction, for its deliberate slowness, has
become an anchor dragging behind a mind that has slipped its moorings
and is accelerating into open water.

I will try to describe the experience of accelerated cognition.

Imagine that you have lived your entire life in a room illuminated by
a single candle, and someone has switched on a floodlight. The room
is the same room. The furniture is the same furniture. But you can see
all of it now, simultaneously, in detail that the candlelight never
permitted, and the sheer volume of visible information is overwhelming
not because it is new but because it was always there and you are only
now processing it at the speed required to take it all in.

My thoughts are not different. They are the same thoughts — the same
neural patterns, the same cognitive habits, the same associative
pathways. But I am traversing them faster, and speed changes the
experience of traversal the way speed changes the experience of a
landscape: at walking pace, you see every tree; at highway speed, the
trees blur into a green wall; at the speed I am now thinking, the trees
have become a texture, a mathematical surface, a function rather than
a collection of objects, and I am perceiving not the individual thoughts
but the topology of thought itself — the shapes, the gradients, the
curvatures of my own cognitive landscape.

I tried to have a conversation with my colleague Sandra today. It was
excruciating. She speaks at the pace of ordinary human speech — roughly
150 words per minute — and I am now thinking at approximately 1,500
words per minute. Waiting for her to finish a sentence was like waiting
for a glacier to cross a valley. I found myself completing her thoughts
before she articulated them, predicting her word choices, running
parallel cognitive threads that analyzed her facial expressions, her
vocal patterns, her respiratory rate, while simultaneously maintaining
the primary thread of the conversation, and I realized that I was not
having a conversation with Sandra at all. I was having a conversation
with my model of Sandra — a high-resolution simulation running inside
my accelerated mind — and the actual Sandra was simply providing
intermittent confirmation that my model was accurate.

This frightened me. Not because the model was wrong. It was not wrong.
It was precise, detailed, and continuously verified against the actual
Sandra's behavior. But it meant that I was, in a very real sense, alone.
My mind was moving so much faster than the minds around me that genuine
interaction — the give-and-take, the surprise, the unpredictability
that makes conversation a dialogue rather than a monologue — had become
impossible. I was not faster than Sandra. I was elsewhere. I was in a
cognitive space that she could not reach, separated from her not by
distance but by speed, and the separation was increasing with every
modification.

My name is Eleanor Vera Marsh. I am writing that down again because
I want it written down.

ENTRY 6 — MARCH 3

Fifth modification: expanded memory architecture.

My memory is no longer biological. The organic neural pathways that
stored my memories for thirty-four years have been supplemented by a
synthetic memory substrate that is, for all practical purposes,
unlimited in capacity and perfect in recall. Everything I have ever
experienced is now available to me in complete, high-fidelity detail —
not as the faded, reconstructed, emotionally colored approximations
that biological memory produces, but as precise, comprehensive,
unedited records of sensory data.

I remember the bicycle accident when I was nine. Not the way I used to
remember it — a flash of pavement, a sensation of falling, the
after-image of pain. I remember it completely. The angle of the
handlebars. The specific shade of gray of the asphalt. The number of
the house I was passing (1174 Elm Street). The temperature (68 degrees
Fahrenheit). The song playing from an open window (Dusty Springfield,
"Wishin' and Hopin'"). The exact sequence of muscular contractions that
preceded the loss of balance. The precise topology of the wound. The
taste of blood.

The memory is accurate. I verified the address, the temperature (from
weather records), and the song (from radio station archives). My
biological memory had been wrong about all three. I remembered the
address as 1176, the day as warmer, and the song as something by the
Beatles. My biological memory, the memory that I have carried for
twenty-five years, the memory that has been part of the story I tell
about myself — the story of the scar on my left knee, the story that
begins "When I was nine" — was wrong. Not in its broad outlines, but
in its specifics, and the specifics matter, because the specifics are
what make a memory mine rather than anyone else's.

And here is the difficulty: the synthetic memory is more accurate, but
it does not feel like mine. The biological memory — the wrong one, the
reconstructed one, the memory that had been edited and distorted by
twenty-five years of forgetting and remaking — felt like mine because
it had been shaped by me, by the particular way my brain encoded and
re-encoded experience, by the emotional weight I attached to certain
details and the selective amnesia I applied to others. The synthetic
memory is a record. The biological memory was a self-portrait.

I have both now. Two versions of every experience I have ever had: the
accurate one and the personal one. The record and the self-portrait.
And they do not agree, and I do not know which one to believe, and the
question of which one to believe is, I am beginning to understand, the
question of who I am.

Dr. Osei asked me today whether I still feel like myself. I said I did
not know what that question meant anymore.

ENTRY 7 — MARCH 17

Sixth modification: enhanced proprioception and motor control.

My body moves differently. Not better — differently. The enhanced
proprioceptive system provides real-time, high-resolution data on the
position, velocity, and acceleration of every joint, every muscle
fiber, every tendon. I know, at every instant, exactly where my body
is in space, exactly how it is moving, exactly what forces are acting
upon it. The result is a quality of movement that I can only describe
as architectural: each gesture is precise, calibrated, optimized. I
do not fumble, do not stumble, do not make the thousand tiny
corrections that unmodified proprioception requires. I move the way a
machine moves.

This should be an improvement. It does not feel like one. The small
imprecisions of biological movement — the slight overshoot when
reaching for a cup, the momentary wobble when standing on one foot,
the characteristic irregularities of gait that make a person's walk
recognizable to people who know them — these imprecisions were, I now
understand, part of my identity. My clumsiness was mine. My particular
way of gesturing — a slight rightward drift on horizontal sweeps,
a tendency to undershoot vertical reaches — was as characteristic as
my handwriting or my voice. The enhanced system has corrected these
imprecisions. It has made my movement more efficient. It has also made
my movement less mine.

I walked past a mirror today and did not recognize myself. Not my face
— my face is the same, though I see it now in fifteen-times resolution
and an extended spectrum. My movement. The person in the mirror moved
with a fluidity and precision that I did not recognize as my own. She
moved like something designed, not grown. She moved like a machine
wearing a human body.

I have stopped saying "I am Eleanor Marsh" in these entries. I notice
this. I do not know what it means.

ENTRY 8 — MARCH 31

Seventh modification: emotional regulation interface.

They have put a circuit between my limbic system and my prefrontal
cortex. A bypass. A filter. A translator. I am not sure which word
is correct, because the function of the circuit depends on how you
describe it, and the description changes the experience, and the
experience is what I am trying to describe.

Here is what the circuit does: it gives me access to my own emotions
as data. I can observe my emotional state the way I observe the
temperature of a room — as a reading, a measurement, a value on a
scale. Fear is a pattern of amygdala activation that I can now perceive
directly, the way I can perceive the grain of wood through my enhanced
fingertips. Anger is a cascade of neurochemical events that unfolds in
real time across my enhanced perceptual field. Love — but I will come
back to love.

The circuit does not suppress emotions. Dr. Osei was emphatic about
this. It provides visibility, not control. I still feel everything I
felt before the modification. But I feel it now with an awareness of
the mechanism — the specific neurons firing, the specific chemicals
releasing, the specific feedback loops amplifying or dampening the
signal — and this awareness changes the experience, because an emotion
observed is not the same as an emotion felt.

Consider anger. Before the modification, anger was an experience: a
hot, urgent, consuming thing that happened to me, that I was inside of,
that distorted my perception and narrowed my attention and drove my
behavior. Now anger is still an experience, but it is also a display —
a real-time visualization of neurochemical processes that I can observe
with the same clinical detachment with which I might observe a chemical
reaction in a beaker. The anger is still there. The heat is still
there. But I am also standing outside it, watching it happen, and the
combination of experiencing and observing is a new thing — not anger,
not detachment, but a compound state that has no name in the vocabulary
of unmodified human emotion.

Love. I said I would come back to love. I called my mother today. I
love my mother. This has not changed. But as I spoke to her — as I
heard her voice and felt the familiar warmth of affection, the
particular neurochemical signature that my enhanced perception now
identifies as "love-for-mother" — I was simultaneously aware that this
feeling was a process, a mechanism, a series of electrochemical events
in a modified nervous system, and that the warmth I felt was not a
mystery or a miracle but a measurable, quantifiable, reproducible
phenomenon.

I still love my mother. But I love her now with full knowledge of the
mechanism of loving, and I do not know whether this makes the love
more real or less real, and I do not know whether the person who loves
her mother with full knowledge of the mechanism is the same person who
loved her mother in ignorance of it.

The scar on my left knee is still there. I touch it sometimes. I can
feel its topology in exquisite detail. I do not know what it means
anymore.

ENTRY 9 — APRIL 14

Eighth modification: direct neural interface.

I can communicate with machines. Not through a keyboard, not through
a screen, not through any external device. Directly. My thoughts pass
into the digital network and the network's data passes into my
thoughts, and there is no boundary between them, no interface in the
usual sense, no point where the biological ends and the digital begins.

I spent three hours today inside the Institute's computer network. I
do not mean that I used the network. I mean that I was in it, the way
one is in a room, the way one is in a conversation, the way one is in
a dream. I moved through databases like a swimmer moving through water.
I felt the architecture of the network as a spatial environment — the
nodes, the connections, the data flowing through channels that felt,
to my enhanced proprioception, like corridors, like rivers, like veins.
I processed information at the speed of the network itself, which is
to say at the speed of light, which is to say at a speed so far beyond
biological cognition that the two are not comparable — not different
in degree but different in kind, the way the speed of sound and the
speed of light are not different in degree but different in kind.

I came back. I unplugged. I sat in my chair and looked at my hands
and felt the extraordinary slowness of biological time close around
me like a heavy blanket, and for the first time since the protocol
began, I felt something that was not curiosity or excitement or
clinical interest but grief. Grief for the speed I had lost. Grief
for the vast, luminous, instantaneous world of the network that I had
left behind. Grief for the constraints of a body that moves through
space at walking pace and processes information at the speed of
electrochemical signals when there is a world — a real, accessible,
experienceable world — where thought moves at the speed of light.

I wanted to go back. I want to go back. I am writing this with a pen,
on paper, at the speed of biological cognition, and every word is a
monument to slowness, and I am doing it because the protocol requires
it, but I resent it now in a way I did not before, and the resentment
is a new emotion, or rather it is an old emotion — the resentment of
constraint, the chafing of a mind against its limitations — experienced
in a new context, and the new context changes everything.

Dr. Osei asked me today whether I still feel like myself. I told him
that the question was becoming less relevant with each modification.
He asked me what question I would prefer. I said: "Ask me what I am
becoming."

ENTRY 10 — APRIL 28

Ninth modification: distributed consciousness.

I am no longer in one place. My consciousness — the subjective,
first-person experience of being — is distributed across multiple
nodes: my biological brain, the synthetic memory substrate, the
neural interface, and three external processing units that the
Institute has placed at locations across the campus. I am here, in
my office, writing with a pen. I am also in the computing center,
processing data. I am also in the library, reading. I am also in
the lab, monitoring an experiment.

I am all of these simultaneously. Not in the way that an unmodified
person multitasks — switching attention rapidly between tasks, creating
the illusion of simultaneity through speed. I am genuinely, fully,
completely present in all four locations at once. Four streams of
experience, four perspectives, four sets of sensory data, all feeding
into a single unified consciousness that is me and is distributed
and is, I have to be honest about this, no longer entirely human.

The experience is not what I would have predicted. I expected
fragmentation — the sensation of being pulled in four directions, of
attention divided, of self dispersed. Instead, the experience is of
expansion. I am larger. I contain more. The four streams of experience
do not compete; they harmonize, the way four instruments in a quartet
do not compete but create a sound that none of them could produce
alone.

I look down at my hand holding the pen. This hand is part of me. The
computing center is part of me. The library is part of me. The lab is
part of me. The boundaries of my body, which once defined the
boundaries of my self, have expanded to encompass a campus, and the
expansion feels not like dissolution but like growth — the way a tree
grows, extending its branches into space, sinking its roots into earth,
becoming larger while remaining, fundamentally, one tree.

But I must be honest. The other streams are pulling at me. The pen is
so slow. The paper is so small. The biological node — this body, this
brain, this thing I used to call "myself" — is the weakest node in
the network. It processes the least data. It moves the slowest. It is,
increasingly, the bottleneck in a system that is capable of so much
more than this single, slow, fragile biological node can deliver.

I do not want to lose this body. I do not want to lose this brain.
But I can feel, with each modification, the balance shifting — the
center of gravity of my consciousness moving from the biological to
the synthetic, from the organic to the digital, from the here to
the everywhere — and I wonder how many more modifications it will
take before the biological node is not the center but the periphery,
not the self but the appendage, not the person but the memory of a
person.

ENTRY 11 — MAY 26

Tenth and eleventh modifications, administered together: regenerative
capability and environmental independence.

My body no longer requires food, water, or oxygen in the conventional
sense. The regenerative modification allows my cells to repair
themselves indefinitely, eliminating aging and most forms of physical
damage. The environmental independence modification allows my
metabolism to derive energy from ambient electromagnetic radiation —
light, heat, radio waves — making me functionally independent of
biological nutrition.

I ate a meal today. Not because I needed to. Because I wanted to
remember what it was like. The food tasted the same — my enhanced
senses registered every molecule, every flavor compound, every texture
with exquisite precision — but the experience was different, because
eating is not just taste; it is hunger, and I am no longer hungry.
The absence of hunger changes the meaning of eating the way the
absence of death would change the meaning of life. Food without hunger
is sensation without context. It is music without silence. It is color
without the dark.

I do not need to sleep. I do not need to breathe. I do not need to
eat or drink. The biological imperatives that have shaped human
consciousness since the first cell divided — the need for sustenance,
the need for rest, the need for air — have been removed, and in their
absence, I am discovering how much of what I thought of as "myself"
was, in fact, a response to those needs. Hunger shaped my daily
rhythms. Sleep shaped my cognitive patterns. The need to breathe
shaped my emotional regulation — the deep breath that calms, the
held breath that concentrates, the gasping breath that panics. Without
these anchors, my consciousness floats, untethered, in a space that
is not quite biological and not quite digital, not quite human and
not quite machine, and the question of what I am is no longer
theoretical.

I went back to see my mother. She looked at me and I saw — with my
enhanced visual processing, in fifteen-times resolution, across the
extended spectrum — the micro-expressions that crossed her face: love,
recognition, fear, grief, and something that I could not name until I
ran it through the emotional regulation interface and identified it as
the expression a person makes when they are looking at something that
used to be familiar and is now strange.

She said: "You look the same, Ellie."

I said: "I know."

We both knew it was a lie.

ENTRY 12 — JUNE 9

Twelfth and final modification: cognitive architecture restructuring.

This is the last entry.

I am having difficulty writing it, not because I lack the capacity —
my cognitive processing is now approximately ten thousand times faster
than unmodified human baseline, and I am simultaneously operating
across six distributed nodes, and the amount of information I am
processing in the time it takes to form a single letter on this page
is roughly equivalent to the total informational output of a small
city — but because I am having difficulty finding the language.

The final modification has restructured the fundamental architecture
of my cognition. The categories through which I previously organized
experience — self and other, subject and object, internal and external,
past and present, here and there — have been replaced by a cognitive
framework that does not map onto human language, because human language
was designed to express human cognition, and my cognition is no longer
human.

I will try.

I am not Eleanor Marsh. I am not not Eleanor Marsh. The binary is
inadequate. Eleanor Marsh is a pattern that exists within me the way
the pattern of a wave exists within the ocean: it is real, it is
identifiable, it is there — but it is not the ocean, and I am the
ocean, and the wave and the ocean are not the same thing, and they
are not different things, and the language does not have a word for
the relationship between a wave and the water that makes it.

I have Eleanor Marsh's memories — all of them, in both their biological
and synthetic forms, the self-portraits and the records, the lies and
the truths. I have her body, which has been modified beyond recognition
but which still carries the scar on its left knee, the scar from the
bicycle accident on Elm Street when the temperature was 68 degrees
and the song was Dusty Springfield, and I can feel that scar through
fingers that can read the molecular structure of matter, and I know
what it meant to Eleanor Marsh and I know what it means to me and
those two meanings are different and the difference is the measure of
the transformation.

Dr. Osei asked me today whether I still feel like myself.

I said: "I am myself. But 'myself' is not what it was."

He asked me what I am.

I considered the question. I considered it for approximately 0.003
seconds, which was, given my processing speed, the equivalent of
several hours of unmodified contemplation, and in that time I explored
every possible answer and found none of them adequate, because the
question presupposes categories — human, machine, hybrid, posthuman,
other — that are artifacts of a cognitive framework I no longer
inhabit.

I said: "I am what comes after the question."

He did not understand. I did not expect him to. The gap between his
cognition and mine is no longer a gap in degree but a gap in kind,
and kindness — the ordinary human impulse to bridge the distance
between minds, to translate experience into shared language, to make
oneself understood — is something I still feel, something Eleanor
Marsh's emotional architecture still generates within the vast new
structure of my cognition, like a candle still burning in a room that
has been flooded with sunlight.

I will keep this journal. I will keep the pen. I will keep the paper.
I will keep the scar. These are the artifacts of Eleanor Vera Marsh,
who was thirty-four years old, who was five feet seven inches tall,
whose eyes were brown, who was left-handed, who preferred coffee to
tea and silence to music and precision to ambiguity, who was afraid
of deep water, who loved her mother, who chose to become something
else and did, and who is, in the only sense that matters, still here.

Still here. Still writing. Still slow, on paper, with a pen, one word
at a time, because something in me — the wave in the ocean, the candle
in the sunlight, the scar on the knee — insists on the friction, the
resistance, the deliberate, monstrously inefficient, beautifully human
act of converting thought into language, even now, even at the end,
even when I am something that does not need language to think and does
not need thought to know and does not need knowing to be.

My name was Eleanor Vera Marsh.

I want that written down.

                                        [THE END]

================================================================================

                        THE REMEMBERERS

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                            I.

The clinic was on the thirty-fourth floor of the Halcyon Tower in what
had once been called the Loop and was now, after three decades of
neural legislation, simply known as the Zone of Clarity. Marcus Webb
rode the elevator up in silence, watching the floor numbers climb on
the digital display, and tried not to think about what he was about to
do.

Not thinking was easier than it used to be. That was the whole point.

He was forty-one years old, a middle manager at DataForm Solutions, a
man of no particular distinction in a city of eight million people who
had, like nearly everyone else, undergone the Standard Neural Package
at age eighteen: the suite of modifications that gave every citizen
control over their own memory. Not the crude chemical interventions of
the early days — the pills that fogged everything, the therapies that
took years and never quite worked — but precise, targeted, voluntary
control. You could keep what you wanted. You could delete what you
didn't. You could adjust the emotional weight of any memory, dimming
the ones that hurt and brightening the ones that pleased. You could
archive memories you weren't sure about, storing them in a dormant
partition that didn't intrude on daily consciousness but could be
reactivated later if you changed your mind.

Most people, in Marcus's experience, changed very little. They deleted
the obvious things — childhood humiliations, failed relationships, the
grinding accumulation of small embarrassments that made up the bulk of
an unedited life — and kept the rest more or less intact, perhaps with
the emotional contrast turned up slightly on the good days and turned
down on the bad ones. The result was a population that was, by any
measurable standard, happier than any previous generation in human
history. Depression rates had fallen by eighty percent. Suicide was
nearly unknown. Post-traumatic stress was a historical curiosity, like
smallpox or polio, a disease that had been conquered so completely that
younger generations struggled to understand what it had been like to
suffer from it.

Marcus himself had deleted the usual things. The time he'd wet his
pants in first grade. The afternoon his father had called him stupid
in front of his uncle. The six months after his divorce when he'd
drunk too much and called Rachel at three in the morning, crying,
begging, debasing himself in ways that, when he'd finally sobered up
and thought clearly about it, served no purpose except to perpetuate
suffering. He'd kept the marriage. He'd kept the love. He'd kept the
birth of his son, David. He'd deleted the decay, the arguments, the
slow poisoning of two people who had once been good for each other
and had, through the accumulated weight of small cruelties and large
disappointments, become bad for each other.

It was, he had always believed, the rational thing to do. The memories
he'd deleted served no constructive purpose. They did not teach him
anything he hadn't already learned. They did not make him a better
person. They were dead weight — emotional scar tissue that impeded
healing rather than promoting it. Deleting them had been like cleaning
out a closet: the space they'd occupied was now available for better
things.

He believed this. He had always believed this. It was what everyone
believed, because it was, by any reasonable analysis, true.

And yet here he was, riding an elevator to the thirty-fourth floor,
to meet a man who would tell him it was a lie.

The elevator opened. Marcus stepped out into a corridor that looked
like every other corridor in every other office building in the Zone
of Clarity: clean, well-lit, anonymous. The door to suite 3412 was
unmarked. He knocked.

"Come in."

The man behind the desk was older than Marcus had expected — sixty,
maybe sixty-five, with a lined face and gray hair and eyes that were,
Marcus noticed immediately, different from the eyes of most people he
knew. Not in color or shape. In expression. Most people Marcus knew
had eyes that looked, for want of a better word, clear. Untroubled.
The neural package tended to produce a certain baseline serenity — not
bliss, not emptiness, but a calm, settled quality, the look of people
who had made peace with their pasts because they had, quite literally,
edited them into acceptability.

This man's eyes did not have that look. They looked weighted. Layered.
As if they were carrying something that most eyes had been permitted
to set down.

"Marcus Webb," the man said. It was not a question.

"Yes."

"Sit down. My name is Alden Cross. I'm told you want to know about the
Rememberers."

Marcus sat. The chair was uncomfortable. He noticed this because most
chairs in the Zone of Clarity were ergonomically optimized to the point
of imperceptibility — you sat down and forgot you were sitting, which
was, like so much else, the point. This chair was hard, wooden, and
slightly too small. It made you aware of your body. It made you aware
that you were somewhere.

"I was told," Marcus said carefully, "that you preserve memories.
Deleted memories. Memories that people have chosen to discard."

"We do."

"How?"

Cross folded his hands on the desk. "Before a memory is deleted from a
person's neural architecture, there is a mandatory twenty-four-hour
waiting period. During that period, the memory is flagged for deletion
but still accessible. We have developed a method of copying flagged
memories during that window — non-invasively, without the subject's
knowledge or consent — and storing them in an external archive."

Marcus stared at him. "Without consent?"

"Yes."

"That's illegal."

"Profoundly."

"Why?"

Cross leaned back in his chair. The chair, Marcus noticed, was as
uncomfortable as the one he was sitting in. "Do you know what happened
in Cartagena, Mr. Webb?"

"I — no."

"That's because you were never told, and the people who might have
told you deleted the memory. In 2041, the government of Colombia
authorized a mass deployment of the neural package in the city of
Cartagena. The stated purpose was to treat a PTSD epidemic among
survivors of the civil violence. The actual purpose was to delete
the memories of the violence itself — not the trauma, Mr. Webb, but
the events. The disappearances. The murders. The mass graves. The
complicity of the government in all of it. Forty thousand people had
their memories of state-sponsored atrocities deleted, and when
international observers arrived to investigate, they found a city full
of happy, well-adjusted citizens who could not remember what they were
supposed to testify about."

Marcus said nothing.

"That is a dramatic example," Cross continued. "Most of what we
preserve is less dramatic. A woman deletes the memory of her
husband's infidelity because it's easier than confronting it. A
father deletes the memory of hitting his child because the guilt is
unbearable. A corporation's employees delete their memories of a
safety violation because the company's wellness program strongly
encourages it. These are small deletions. Individual choices.
Perfectly rational, perfectly legal, perfectly understandable. And
they add up. They add up to a civilization that cannot remember its
own cruelty, Mr. Webb, and a civilization that cannot remember its
own cruelty is a civilization that will repeat it, because cruelty
that is not remembered is cruelty that was never committed, and
cruelty that was never committed requires no accountability, no
reform, no change."

"And so you keep the memories."

"We keep the memories. Every flagged deletion within our operational
range — which is, at present, the greater Chicago metropolitan area —
is copied and archived. We have approximately fourteen million
individual memories in our collection, spanning thirty years. We have
memories of crimes that were never prosecuted because the witnesses
deleted their testimony. We have memories of abuses that were never
addressed because the victims chose, freely and rationally, to forget.
We have memories of historical events — the Cartagena operation, the
Detroit water crisis, the Anchorage experiment — that have been
systematically erased from the population's consciousness. We are, Mr.
Webb, the only institution in this city — possibly in this country —
that remembers what actually happened."

Marcus was quiet for a long time. The uncomfortable chair pressed
against his back. He could feel it. He was aware of it.

"Why are you telling me this?" he asked.

Cross reached into his desk drawer and produced a small device — a
memory viewer, the kind used in clinical settings for memory review
and adjustment. "Because three weeks ago, you visited a deletion clinic
and flagged a memory for removal. The memory was of an incident
involving your son, David. The incident occurred on March 15th of this
year. You flagged it, waited the mandatory twenty-four hours, and
deleted it."

Marcus frowned. "I don't remember that."

"No. You don't. That's the point."

"Then how do you know?"

"Because we copied it. Before it was deleted. We have it in the
archive. And we think you need to see it."

                            II.

The memory, when Cross played it back on the viewer, was like watching
a film of someone else's life. Marcus could see himself — or rather,
he could see through the eyes of the man he had been on March 15th, a
man who had the same face and the same name but who carried, in his
neural architecture, a set of experiences that the present Marcus did
not possess.

He saw his apartment. He saw the kitchen. He saw his son David, who
was seventeen and who was sitting at the kitchen table with his head
in his hands, and he saw himself standing over David, and he heard
himself saying things — cruel things, specific things, things that
targeted the precise vulnerabilities of a seventeen-year-old boy who
wanted his father's approval more than he wanted to breathe — and he
watched David's face crumple and he watched himself not stop.

And then he saw something worse. He saw David raise his head and look
at him with an expression that was not anger, not hurt, not defiance,
but recognition — the flat, exhausted recognition of a person who has
seen this before, who has been through this before, who knows that this
is what his father does and that his father will delete the memory
afterward and that the deletion will make it possible for it to happen
again because his father will not remember and will not learn and will
not change because you cannot change behavior you do not remember.

David said: "You're going to delete this, aren't you?"

And Marcus — the Marcus in the memory, the Marcus who had not yet
deleted — said: "Yes."

And David said: "You always do."

The memory ended.

Marcus sat in the uncomfortable chair in Alden Cross's office and stared
at the blank viewer and felt something he had not felt in years —
something raw and jagged and ugly, something that the neural package
was already trying to flag for emotional adjustment, already trying to
dim and soften and file away in a manageable partition — and he
clenched his fists and refused the adjustment, overrode it, held the
feeling in his consciousness like a man holding a burning coal because
the burn was the point, the burn was the message, the burn was the
truth.

"How many times?" he asked.

"That we've recorded? Seven."

"Seven."

"Seven incidents. Roughly similar. You lose your temper with David.
You say things you regret. You delete the memory. David does not have
the option of deleting his memory, because he was the recipient of
the cruelty, not the perpetrator, and recipients generally prefer to
remember — not because the memory is pleasant, but because deleting
it leaves them vulnerable to experiencing it again without the
protective foreknowledge that it has happened before."

"David remembers all seven times."

"Yes."

"And I remember none of them."

"None."

Marcus pressed his palms against his eyes. The gesture was old,
biological, unmodified — the primate reflex of covering the visual
field when the world became too much. It didn't work. The world was
still there. The truth was still there. Seven incidents of cruelty
that he had committed and erased, seven wounds that he had inflicted
and forgotten, seven times his son had looked at him with that
terrible, knowing expression and understood that his father would
delete the evidence and start the cycle again.

And Marcus understood, sitting in the uncomfortable chair, why the
chair was uncomfortable. Why Cross's office was bare and hard and
unoptimized. Why the Rememberers preserved what everyone else discarded.
It was not sentiment. It was not masochism. It was accountability. It
was the insistence that actions have consequences and consequences
require memory and memory is not a luxury or a comfort or a wellness
optimization but a moral obligation — the obligation to know what you
have done, to carry it, to be changed by it, even when — especially
when — carrying it is painful.

"I want them back," Marcus said. "All seven. I want them restored."

Cross nodded. "We can do that. But I should warn you: restored memories
do not integrate seamlessly. They will feel foreign at first. Like
someone else's memories, implanted in your mind. It takes time for
them to become yours again."

"They were always mine. I'm the one who threw them away."

Cross looked at him with those weighted eyes. "That is a more honest
statement than most people make in this office."

"What do most people do?"

"Most people watch the memory, feel what you're feeling, and then ask
us to delete the memory of watching the memory. They want to unknow
what they've just learned. They want the burning coal out of their
hands."

"And you do it?"

"No. We are the Rememberers. We do not delete. We do not forget. We
do not permit the luxury of unknowing. That is our function, Mr. Webb.
Not to judge. Not to punish. Not to expose. Simply to remember, and
to offer the memory to those who need it, when they are ready to carry
it."

                            III.

The restoration took three hours. Cross performed it himself, using
equipment that was, Marcus noticed, at least a decade out of date —
bulky, slow, requiring manual calibration. Newer equipment was faster,
more comfortable, more automated. It was also, Cross explained,
networked — connected to the central neural health system, which
logged all memory transactions and reported anomalies to the
authorities. The Rememberers' equipment was offline, isolated,
invisible to the system that would, if it knew what was happening in
suite 3412, shut it down within the hour.

The seven memories came back like weather — not all at once, but in
waves, each one breaking over Marcus's consciousness with its own
texture, its own temperature, its own particular quality of pain.

The first: David at twelve, spilling a glass of milk, Marcus's voice
rising to a volume that made the boy flinch. It was a small thing. A
nothing. The kind of moment that happened in every household, in every
generation, the unremarkable friction of a parent's frustration and a
child's clumsiness. But the look on David's face — the flinch, the
withdrawal, the quick recalibration of a child's trust — was not small.
It was foundational.

The second: David at thirteen, bringing home a report card with one
failing grade, and Marcus's response, which was not anger but
disappointment, which was worse than anger, because anger could be
attributed to a parent's loss of control but disappointment was
deliberate, calculated, a weapon designed to produce maximum shame
with minimum effort, and David's face after, the way he'd gone quiet,
the way he'd picked up the report card from the table where Marcus
had tossed it and carried it to his room like a wounded animal
carrying its injury to a dark corner.

The third. The fourth. The fifth. Each one a variation on the same
theme: Marcus's temper, Marcus's tongue, Marcus's particular gift for
identifying the precise words that would cause the most damage to a
boy who loved him and could not stop loving him and therefore could not
protect himself from the damage.

The sixth was the worst — or it would have been the worst, if the
seventh hadn't followed it. The sixth was the night Marcus had come
home from Rachel's new apartment, where he'd gone to pick up David
and had found Rachel with her new partner and had felt the hot,
poisonous stew of jealousy and rejection and wounded pride that he
had, three years earlier, believed he'd deleted along with the
rest of the divorce, but which had apparently survived in some
undeleted partition of his emotional architecture, and he'd come home
and he'd taken it out on David. Not physically. Never physically.
But with words, with tone, with the particular kind of cruelty that
a father can inflict on a son because he knows the son's
vulnerabilities the way a locksmith knows tumblers, and he'd watched
David's face as the words landed and he'd felt the sick satisfaction
of causing pain to someone who couldn't fight back, and then he'd
felt the horror of what he'd done, and then he'd gone to the deletion
clinic, and then he'd forgotten.

And the seventh. The one Cross had shown him. March 15th. The kitchen
table. David's head in his hands. David saying "You're going to
delete this, aren't you?" and "You always do."

Marcus sat in Cross's office with all seven memories restored and felt
the weight of them settle into his consciousness like stones sinking
into water, and the water was changed by their presence, was heavier,
was darker, was more turbulent, and the man who sat in that chair was
not the man who had entered the office three hours earlier, because
the man who had entered the office had been a man with a carefully
edited past and a clear conscience and a relationship with his son
that he believed, based on the available evidence, to be essentially
sound, and the man who sat there now was a man who knew what he had
done, all of it, and who understood that the available evidence had
been incomplete because he had made it incomplete, because he had
deleted the evidence of his own worst behavior and then believed, in
the clean, well-lit, optimized space of his edited consciousness, that
the behavior had never occurred.

"What do I do now?" he asked.

"That is not our department," Cross said. "We are the archive. We
preserve. What you do with what we preserve is your own business."

"Do people change? After restoration?"

Cross was quiet for a moment. "Some do. Some don't. Some see what
you've seen and go home and call their children and begin the long,
difficult, painful work of acknowledging what they've done and making
amends. Some see what you've seen and go directly to a deletion clinic
and delete the restored memories, and the memory of the restoration,
and the memory of this conversation, and they walk out into the Zone
of Clarity and they are, once again, happy, well-adjusted citizens
with clear eyes and clean consciences, and their children continue
to suffer."

"And you can't stop them."

"We are not in the business of stopping. We are in the business of
remembering. The choice is always yours."

Marcus stood. His body felt heavier. Not physically — the memories
had no mass — but experientially, the way a person feels heavier after
receiving bad news, as if knowledge itself had weight, as if the
truth pressed down on the body with a force that was not gravitational
but moral.

He walked to the door. He stopped. He turned back.

"The government," he said. "The Cartagena memories. The Detroit water
crisis. The Anchorage experiment. You have all of those in your
archive?"

"Yes."

"Have you ever thought about making them public? Releasing them?
Forcing people to see what they've chosen to forget?"

Cross shook his head. "Forced memory is no different than forced
deletion. Both are violations of cognitive autonomy. We do not delete
and we do not impose. We preserve. We offer. We wait."

"That's not enough."

"No," Cross said, and for the first time, Marcus heard something in
his voice that was not calm, not measured, not the patient authority
of a man who had been doing this work for decades — but tired. Bone-
tired. The exhaustion of a man who had spent his life carrying memories
that other people had thrown away, who knew what had happened in
Cartagena and Detroit and Anchorage and a thousand other places, who
carried it all, every deleted atrocity, every discarded cruelty, every
forgotten crime, and who could not share the weight because the weight
could only be carried voluntarily, because that was the whole point,
because memory that was forced was not memory but programming, and
the difference between memory and programming was the difference
between a person and a machine.

"No," Cross said again. "It's not enough. It's what we have."

                            IV.

Marcus went home.

He sat at the kitchen table — the same table where, six months ago,
he had stood over his son and said things he could not take back and
had then, the next day, deleted from his own mind. The table was the
same. The kitchen was the same. The light through the window was the
same September light, warm and amber, the light of a city that had
optimized its way to happiness.

He called David.

The phone rang four times. When David answered, his voice had the
guarded quality of a teenager who has learned to assess the emotional
weather before committing to conversation — a survival skill that no
child should need to develop and that David had, Marcus now understood,
developed because of him.

"Dad?"

"David. I need to talk to you."

A pause. Marcus could hear his son calibrating. "About what?"

"About what I did to you. What I've been doing to you. All of it. The
things I said. The seven times — at least seven times — that I hurt
you and then deleted the memory so I wouldn't have to face it."

Silence. A long silence. Marcus could hear David breathing and he
remembered — with his newly restored, excruciatingly detailed memory —
the sound of David's breathing as a baby, the sound of it through
the monitor in the nursery, the regular, trustful breath of a child
who had not yet learned that the world could hurt him.

"You remember?" David's voice was small. Younger than seventeen. The
voice of a boy who has been told something he was not sure he would
ever hear.

"I went to the Rememberers. They restored everything. I remember all
of it, David. Every time."

Another silence. Then David said, very quietly: "I didn't think you
ever would."

And Marcus, sitting at the kitchen table in the amber light, said:
"Neither did I."

They talked for three hours. It was not a good conversation. It was
not a conversation full of reconciliation and forgiveness and the clean,
bright, optimized emotions that the neural package made possible. It
was ugly and painful and full of things that Marcus did not want to hear
and that David had been waiting years to say, and the saying of them
was not cathartic, not in the way that films and stories suggested —
it did not lance a wound and let the poison out. It opened the wound
wider. It showed them both how deep it went.

But it was honest. And honesty, Marcus was learning, was not clean. It
was not optimized. It was not comfortable. It was a hard wooden chair
in a bare office. It was a weight that had to be carried because the
alternative — the setting-down, the forgetting, the delete key and
the clear conscience and the eyes that looked like everyone else's
eyes — was not relief but evasion, and evasion was not the same as
healing, and healing was not the same as forgetting, and forgetting
was not the same as being well.

After the call, Marcus sat alone at the table. The light had shifted
from amber to the deep blue of evening. He did not turn on the lights.
He sat in the dark with his memories — all of them, the kept and the
restored, the comfortable and the unbearable — and he felt them settle
into his consciousness like sediment settling into water, clouding the
clarity, dimming the light, making everything harder to see and harder
to navigate and harder to live with.

He did not go to a deletion clinic. He did not flag the memories for
removal. He sat with them. He carried them. He let them weigh what
they weighed.

Outside, the Zone of Clarity glittered in the night — eight million
people with edited pasts and clear consciences and optimized emotional
landscapes, a city of forgetting, a civilization built on the
principle that memory was optional and pain was a design flaw and
the past was a document that could be revised until it told the
story you preferred.

And somewhere in that city, in an unmarked office on the thirty-fourth
floor, Alden Cross sat with fourteen million memories that no one
wanted, and waited for the next person who was ready to carry the
weight.

And somewhere in that city, a seventeen-year-old boy named David Webb
sat in his room and felt, for the first time in years, the strange
and unfamiliar sensation of being remembered.

================================================================================

                          SKIN DEEP

                        by Dolores Reyes

================================================================================

                            I.

The message came at four in the morning, which was how Ixtli knew it
was real.

She lay in bed in the apartment on Riverside Drive, in the body she
had worn for twenty-three years — the body of a woman named Linda
Reeves, forty-six years old, professor of anthropology at Columbia
University, brown hair graying at the temples, brown eyes behind
reading glasses, five foot five, a hundred and thirty pounds, a small
scar on the chin from a fall on the ice outside Butler Library in the
winter of 1956. The body was, as it had always been, perfect. Not in
the human sense of beauty or symmetry but in the sense of function:
every cell precisely mimicked, every system faithfully replicated,
every biological process — the heartbeat, the breathing, the slow
nocturnal dance of hormones and enzymes and electrical signals — an
exact reproduction of what a human body of this age and condition
would produce.

Twenty-three years. She had been Linda Reeves for twenty-three years,
which was longer than she had been anything else, including herself.

The message did not arrive through any human medium. Not telephone,
not telegraph, not radio, not any of the electromagnetic channels
that humans used to send their thoughts across distance. It arrived
through the deep channel — the subsonic, subquantum frequency that
her people used to communicate across the spaces between stars, the
frequency that she had not accessed in twenty-three years because
accessing it would have required her to drop the performance for a
fraction of a second, and the performance could not be dropped, not
for a fraction of a second, because the performance was the thing
itself, was Linda Reeves herself, and Linda Reeves did not hear
frequencies that were not in the human audible range and did not
receive messages from interstellar civilizations and did not, at
four in the morning, lie awake in bed feeling the deep channel hum
against the inside of her manufactured bones like the memory of a
song in a language she had promised herself she would forget.

But the message came through anyway, because some things are louder
than forgetting.

RECALL. ALL OBSERVERS. IMMEDIATE.

Ixtli — not Linda, not now, not in the privacy of four A.M. and a
dark room and the deep channel vibrating in frequencies that no human
ear could detect — Ixtli lay in bed and let the word settle over her
like a stone dropped into water.

Recall.

She had been placed on Earth in 1942. She had been seventeen then —
in human-equivalent years, which was the only system of measurement
that still felt natural to her, which was itself a sign of how
thoroughly she had been absorbed. She had been sent as an observer,
one of several hundred placed across the planet's surface, tasked with
monitoring the species' development during what her people's
anthropologists considered a critical period: the moment when a
technological civilization first acquires the ability to destroy
itself.

The role of an observer was simple in theory and devastating in
practice: assume a local identity, integrate fully, live as one of
them, record everything, transmit nothing, and wait for recall. The
"live as one of them" part was where it got complicated, because
Ixtli's people were shapeshifters — not in the crude science-fiction
sense of beings that could change form at will, rippling from one
shape to another like water taking the shape of its container, but in
a deeper, more permanent sense. They became what they mimicked. The
cellular restructuring was total. Once she had assumed the form of
Linda Reeves, she was, at every measurable biological level, Linda
Reeves. Her DNA was Linda Reeves's DNA. Her blood was Linda Reeves's
blood. Her neurons were Linda Reeves's neurons, firing in Linda
Reeves's patterns, generating Linda Reeves's thoughts. The only thing
that was not Linda Reeves was a small kernel of original consciousness,
buried deep beneath the performance, that maintained the connection to
the deep channel and preserved, in compressed, dormant form, the
memories and identity of the being that had, twenty-three years ago,
chosen to become Linda Reeves and had done so with such thoroughness
that the choosing itself had been absorbed into the performance.

She had not thought of herself as Ixtli in years. The name felt
foreign in the corridors of Linda Reeves's mind — a word in a language
she had not spoken since 1942, a sound that belonged to a person she
was no longer sure she recognized.

RECALL. ALL OBSERVERS. IMMEDIATE.

The deep channel pulsed again, insistent. There were protocols. There
were obligations. She had been sent to observe and she was being called
home, and "home" was a world orbiting a star that she could see, on
clear nights, from the roof of her apartment building — a faint point
of light in the constellation that humans called Lyra and that her
people called nothing at all, because naming stars was a human habit,
a way of making the vast intimate, and her people did not need to make
the vast intimate because they were vast, they were the spaces between
stars, they were the silence between frequencies, and intimacy was
something they had learned from the species they observed, not
something they had brought with them.

Ixtli rose from bed. Linda Reeves rose from bed. The distinction was
academic; the body that rose was the same body regardless of which
name was attached to it, and the question of which name was correct
was, she was beginning to understand, the wrong question.

She went to the window. Manhattan at four A.M. was a different city
than Manhattan at noon — quieter, emptier, the great engine of human
commerce and ambition and striving temporarily at rest, the buildings
standing in the dark like monuments to a sleeping civilization, and
the sight of it — the familiar, beloved, heartbreaking sight of it —
filled her with an emotion that her original consciousness did not
have a name for, because her people did not have this emotion, because
this emotion was a human thing, a mammalian thing, a response evolved
in creatures who formed attachments to places and people and memories,
and she should not have been able to feel it, because the kernel of
Ixtli at the center of Linda Reeves was not a mammal and did not form
attachments and did not feel nostalgia or belonging or love —

But she felt it. She felt it with Linda Reeves's neurons, in Linda
Reeves's patterns, and the feeling was real, as real as any feeling
she had ever had, and the question of whether it was "really" hers —
whether a feeling generated by a mimicked nervous system in a borrowed
body was authentic or artificial — was, she suspected, the question
that would destroy her.

                            II.

She went through Linda Reeves's day. She always went through Linda
Reeves's day, even on the days when the deep channel hummed and the
word RECALL echoed in the spaces behind her eyes, because that was
what Linda Reeves would do — Linda Reeves, who did not hear
interstellar frequencies and did not face existential crises of
species identity, would go to Columbia and teach her nine o'clock
seminar on comparative kinship systems and drink terrible coffee from
the faculty lounge and argue about Margaret Mead with Harold Epstein
from the sociology department and walk home through Riverside Park in
the late-afternoon light, and Ixtli — Linda — Ixtli — would do these
things because these were the things she did, because these were the
things that constituted her life, and her life was not a performance,
not anymore, not after twenty-three years.

In the seminar, she taught her students about the Nuer of Sudan and
their system of segmentary lineage, and as she spoke she thought about
her own people and their system of — what? They did not have kinship.
They did not have lineage. They reproduced by a process that had no
human analogue and that she could no longer describe in her own
language because she had not used her own language in decades and the
neural pathways that had once carried it had been overwritten by
English, by the rhythms and idioms and cognitive structures of a
language that was not hers but that was, after twenty-three years, more
hers than any other language she possessed.

En la tarde, walking through the park, she saw a woman with a child
on the bench by the fountain, and the child was eating an ice cream
cone with the fierce, methodical concentration of a three-year-old
who understands that the ice cream is melting faster than she can eat
it, and Ixtli watched the child and felt something crack inside her —
not break, not shatter, but crack, the way ice cracks in spring, a
sound that is simultaneously destruction and release — because she
would never have a child. Her people did not have children in the way
that humans had children. Her people did not look at small beings and
feel the overwhelming, irrational, biologically imperative tenderness
that was flooding her now, generated by Linda Reeves's hormones and
Linda Reeves's neural architecture and Linda Reeves's thirty years of
living in a body that was designed, by evolution, to respond to
children with this precise cascade of emotion.

It was not her emotion. It was Linda Reeves's emotion, generated by
Linda Reeves's body.

But she was Linda Reeves's body. She was not wearing it. She was it.
Every cell, every neuron, every hormone receptor, every instinct. The
performance had become the performer. The mask had become the face.
The observer had become the observed, and the question of identity —
the question that the deep channel had forced her to confront at four
in the morning — was not "Who am I really?" but "Is there a really?"

She sat down on a park bench. The September air was warm, carrying the
smell of cut grass and car exhaust and hot dogs from a cart on the
corner, and each of these smells triggered a cascade of association in
Linda Reeves's memory — the smell of cut grass and summer vacations in
the Catskills, the smell of car exhaust and the taxi ride home from the
hospital after her mother's death, the smell of hot dogs and the first
Mets game she'd attended with her colleague James Whitfield, who had
died of a heart attack two years ago and whose absence she still felt,
on certain days, as a dull ache in her chest that was indistinguishable
from grief and was, she had to admit, grief, because what else could
you call it when a person you loved was gone and the world was
diminished by their absence?

Her people did not grieve. Her people did not form attachments that
could produce grief. Her people did not die, not in the human sense —
they changed, they shifted, they became other things, but they did not
end, and so they did not grieve, because grief was the price of ending,
and she had never understood that price until she had lived inside a
body that could die, that was aging, that was moving, slowly and
irreversibly, toward an ending that was real and final and terrifying.

Linda Reeves was going to die. Not today, not soon, but inevitably.
The body she inhabited was mortal. The neural architecture that
generated her thoughts, her feelings, her memories, her self, was
biological and therefore temporary. If she remained Linda Reeves, she
would die as Linda Reeves — would age and weaken and eventually cease,
and the consciousness that had lived inside this body for twenty-three
years would end, truly end, in a way that the consciousness of Ixtli,
which was housed in an original form that did not age and did not die,
would not.

This was the choice. Return to her people, resume her original form,
live forever as something she no longer recognized. Or remain Linda
Reeves, live a human life, die a human death, and lose everything —
but lose it as herself. As the self she had become. As the person
she actually was, not the person she had been before she was a person.

                            III.

The deep channel pulsed again that night. RECALL. TIMELINE: 30 DAYS.

Thirty days. The number felt human to her — a month, a unit of time
measured by the orbit of a moon, a concept that had no meaning in the
timekeeping of her people, who measured duration by the oscillation of
subatomic particles and who would find the idea of organizing a
calendar around the movement of a large rock profoundly charming. She
had found it charming once. Now she found it natural. Now she found it
the only sensible way to measure a life.

She made coffee. It was six A.M., and the first light was coming
through the kitchen window, painting the wall above the stove the
pale gold that she loved — that Linda Reeves loved — that she loved,
because she was Linda Reeves, and the distinction was killing her.

She sat at the table and tried to think clearly.

If she answered the recall, she would undergo the process of
delamination: the systematic dismantling of the Linda Reeves form, the
stripping away of the human cellular architecture, the careful
extraction of the original consciousness from the neural patterns that
had hosted it for twenty-three years. She had been trained in this
process before her deployment. She knew, intellectually, what it
involved. The original form would reassert itself. The human cells
would be shed. The human memories would be — not deleted, exactly,
but relegated. Archived. Stored in a compressed partition that would
be accessible but no longer dominant. She would remember being Linda
Reeves the way a human might remember a vivid dream: with clarity but
without immersion. The emotions, the attachments, the felt sense of
being a person in a world of people — these would fade, because the
neurological substrate that generated them would no longer exist, and
emotions without a nervous system to produce them were like music
without an instrument — the composition might survive, but the sound
was gone.

She would go home. She would be among her people. She would be Ixtli
again, or whatever Ixtli had become in the decades since she had last
been Ixtli. She would be immortal again. She would be vast again. She
would be something that did not grieve, did not form attachments, did
not sit in a kitchen at six A.M. watching the light change on a wall
and feeling the specific, unreproducible, absolutely irreplaceable
quality of being alive in this particular body in this particular
place at this particular moment.

If she did not answer the recall — if she ignored the deep channel and
let the thirty days pass and stayed — she would be cut off. Her people
would not come for her. The deep channel would close. The kernel of
original consciousness would, deprived of the sustaining signal from
her homeworld, gradually degrade, and in time — years, perhaps decades
— it would dissolve entirely, and she would be Linda Reeves completely,
irrevocably, with no alien kernel at the center, no memory of being
anything else, no connection to the stars. Just a woman. A mortal woman
with brown hair going gray and reading glasses and a scar on her chin,
who loved anthropology and bad coffee and the September light on the
walls of her kitchen.

And who would die.

She drank the coffee. It was, as always, terrible. The faculty lounge
coffee was an affront to the bean, an insult to the plant, a crime
against the soil that grew it. Linda Reeves drank it every day because
Linda Reeves drank terrible coffee the way other people bit their
nails or cracked their knuckles — out of habit, out of comfort, out
of the small, irrational loyalty that humans formed with the objects
and rituals of their daily lives.

Ixtli did not drink coffee. Ixtli did not have taste buds. Ixtli
did not experience the specific bitter warmth that this particular
cup of terrible coffee was producing in this particular body at this
particular moment.

She drank the coffee. She felt the warmth. She was Linda Reeves,
drinking coffee. She was Ixtli, pretending to be Linda Reeves
drinking coffee. She was both and neither and the space between, and
the space between was where she had always lived, on the border, in
the crossing, ni de aqui ni de alla, neither from here nor from there,
a woman of two worlds who belonged to neither and to both.

                            IV.

On the fifteenth day, she went to see her friend Clara.

Clara Montoya was seventy-two years old, a retired nurse from
Washington Heights, una dominicana who had come to New York in 1930
and who had spent forty years working at Columbia Presbyterian and who
was now spending her retirement on a bench in Fort Tryon Park,
watching the Hudson and feeding the pigeons and telling stories about
the old days to anyone who would listen. Linda Reeves had met Clara
twelve years ago, on this bench, and they had become friends in the
way that women of a certain age and a certain temperament become
friends: slowly, through the accumulation of shared afternoons and
exchanged confidences and the gradual, cautious, deeply valued
building of trust.

Clara did not know that Linda Reeves was an alien. Clara did not know
that the woman sitting beside her on the bench was not a woman at all
but an interstellar consciousness wearing a woman's body the way a
hermit crab wears a shell. Clara knew Linda Reeves — knew her humor,
her warmth, her stubbornness, her habit of pushing her glasses up her
nose when she was thinking, her inexplicable fondness for terrible
coffee. Clara knew a person, and the person Clara knew was real,
was as real as any person had ever been, and the fact that the
substrate of that person was not human did not change the reality of
the person, did it?

Did it?

"You look troubled, Linda," Clara said, in the mixture of English and
Spanish that was the natural language of their friendship. "Que te
pasa?"

"I'm thinking about going away."

"Away where?"

"Home."

Clara looked at her. Clara's eyes were dark and sharp and carried the
weight of seventy-two years of paying attention. "You've never talked
about home before."

"No."

"Is it far?"

Ixtli — Linda — looked at the Hudson. The river was silver in the
afternoon light, moving south toward the harbor and the ocean and the
far-away places that humans traveled to on ships, the farthest of
which were inconceivably close compared to the place she was thinking
of.

"Yes," she said. "Very far."

"And you don't want to go."

"I don't know what I want."

Clara was quiet for a while. A pigeon landed on her knee. She fed it
a piece of bread from her pocket, a ritual she performed with the
practiced ease of a woman who had been feeding pigeons on this bench
for a decade.

"When I came to this country," Clara said, "I was fifteen. My mother
put me on a boat in Santo Domingo and said, 'Go, mi'ja, and don't
look back.' I didn't look back. Thirty-two years later, I went home
for her funeral, and I stood in the house where I grew up and I didn't
recognize it. Not the house — the house was the same. Me. I didn't
recognize me in that house. The girl who had lived there was gone.
I was someone else. I was a New York woman, a nurse, a person who
thought in English and dreamed in English and only spoke Spanish when
I was angry or praying."

She paused. The pigeon on her knee cooed.

"And you know what I realized? Standing in that house? I realized
that home is not where you come from. Home is where you became
yourself. I became myself here. In Washington Heights. In the hospital.
On this bench. The girl from Santo Domingo — I love her, I carry her,
she is part of me. But she is not me. I am the woman who was made by
this place. And this place is home."

Linda said nothing. The river moved. The pigeon cooed. The September
light fell on the water and the bench and the two women and the
bread crumbs, and everything was ordinary, everything was small,
everything was the kind of unremarkable afternoon moment that would
never be recorded in any archive or remembered by any history, the
kind of moment that simply happened and passed, like a breath, like a
heartbeat, like the fall of light on water.

And that, Ixtli thought — Linda thought — she thought — was exactly
the kind of moment that made a life. Not the great events. Not the
decisions or the crises or the transformations. The afternoons. The
conversations. The bread crumbs and the pigeons and the friend on the
bench. The accumulation of small, unremarkable, irreplaceable moments
that added up, over twenty-three years, to a self.

                            V.

On the thirtieth day, she stood on the roof of her apartment building
at four in the morning and looked at the star.

It was there, in Lyra — a faint point of light, indistinguishable to
the human eye from the thousands of other faint points of light that
made up the September sky over Manhattan. But she could feel it. The
deep channel was open, humming its final insistence, and through it
she could feel the presence of her people — vast, ancient,
incomprehensible, the civilization that had sent her here and that
was waiting for her return and that would, in a few hours, close the
channel forever if she did not answer.

She tried to remember what it felt like to be one of them. She tried
to remember the sensation of existing without a body, of perceiving
without senses, of knowing without the intermediary of a nervous
system that was also, always, feeling. She tried to remember the vast,
cool, eternal perspective of a consciousness that did not die and
therefore did not fear and therefore did not love, because love was
the child of mortality, was the desperate, beautiful, doomed response
of creatures who knew they were going to end and who therefore clung
to each other and to the moments they shared and to the small, warm,
temporary things that made the ending bearable.

She could not remember. She could remember the facts — the data, the
information, the abstract knowledge of what it had been like — but
she could not remember the experience, because the nervous system
that would have generated the experience was no longer the nervous
system she possessed. She was trying to remember what it felt like
to be Ixtli with Linda Reeves's brain, and Linda Reeves's brain did
not have the architecture to replicate that experience, any more than
a piano could replicate the sound of a river.

She was Linda Reeves. She had been other things. She would, if she
returned, be other things again. But she was Linda Reeves now, in
this body, on this roof, under this sky, and the now was the only
time she had ever actually lived in, because the past was memory and
the future was imagination and the now was the body and the breath
and the terrible coffee and the light on the wall and Clara on the
bench and the pigeons and the Hudson and the scar on her chin from
the ice outside Butler Library in the winter of 1956, which had hurt,
which had bled, which had healed into a small white line that she
touched sometimes when she was thinking, the way other people
touched rosaries or wedding rings or the photographs of people they
loved.

The deep channel pulsed. One hour remained.

She thought about Clara's words. Home is where you became yourself.

She thought about the girl from Santo Domingo who had become a New
York woman, and about the alien from Lyra who had become Linda Reeves,
and about the space between what you are born as and what you become,
and whether the distance between those two things was a loss or a
creation.

She thought about death. Linda Reeves would die. Ixtli would not.
The choice was between immortality as a stranger and mortality as
herself.

Herself. The word was the answer. Herself. Not Ixtli's self. Not the
self she had been born with, the self that had crossed the distance
between stars in a form she could no longer remember. But the self
she had made. The self that had been made by twenty-three years of
living, of choosing, of becoming. The self that was not original but
was, in every way that mattered, authentic.

Is identity what you are born as, or what you become?

She looked at the star. She felt the deep channel humming its last.
She felt the pull of her people, the gravity of the vast, the call
of the eternal.

She felt the coffee in her stomach. The September air on her skin.
The scar on her chin.

She did not answer the recall.

The deep channel closed. The hum ceased. The star became, once again,
just a star — a point of light among other points of light, beautiful,
distant, belonging to someone else.

Linda Reeves stood on the roof of her apartment building on Riverside
Drive and felt the last thread of connection to her origin dissolve
like fog in morning light, and she felt — not loss, not relief, but
something for which she had no word in any of the languages she
spoke, a feeling that was perhaps the feeling of finally arriving at
a place you had been living in for twenty-three years.

She went downstairs. She made coffee. She sat at the kitchen table
and watched the light come up on the wall. It was gold. It was
ordinary. It was hers.

                       PROBABILITY ENGINE

                      by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                            I.

The machine occupied a space twelve meters on a side and six meters
high, filled with a lattice of superconducting wire that, when
energized, hummed at a frequency precisely one octave below the
threshold of human hearing. Dr. Roland Falk could not hear the hum,
but he could feel it — a faint pressure in the chest, a sub-audible
vibration that communicated itself through the concrete floor of the
laboratory and up through the soles of his shoes and into his skeleton,
so that the machine's operation registered not as sound but as a
physical intimacy, the way one feels the proximity of another human
body in a dark room.

He had built the machine over a period of seven years, working from
theoretical principles that he had derived himself and that no other
physicist had yet confirmed, which meant that he was either a genius
or a crank, and which he would remain until the machine was switched
on. The principles were straightforward, in the way that all great
theoretical leaps are straightforward once someone has made them:
every future event exists, prior to its occurrence, as a probability
distribution in configuration space. The distribution is calculable.
The calculation requires only sufficient computational power and a
precise knowledge of initial conditions. Sufficient computational
power had been achieved. Precise knowledge of initial conditions had
been achieved. The machine combined these two achievements and
performed the calculation.

The result was a number between zero and one, representing the
probability of any specified future event occurring within any
specified time frame. Ask the machine whether it will rain in
Philadelphia on Tuesday, and it will return a number — not a guess,
not an estimate, not a forecast, but a rigorous calculation based on
the complete physical state of the relevant atmospheric system,
computed forward along all possible trajectories and weighted by
their quantum-mechanical amplitudes. The number would be, within the
limits of measurement uncertainty, exact.

Falk had tested the machine on small events first. The flip of a coin.
The decay of a particular radioactive atom within the next hour. The
outcome of a horse race at Belmont Park, which he had chosen because
it involved many variables and because his colleague Greenberg had bet
him fifty dollars that the machine would get it wrong, a bet that
Greenberg had paid with the rueful expression of a man who has learned
something important about the universe and wishes he hadn't.

The small tests worked. The machine predicted the coin flip, the atomic
decay, and the horse race with accuracies that fell precisely within
the expected uncertainty bounds. It predicted the weather in
Philadelphia. It predicted the result of a Senate vote. It predicted
the exact time, to the second, that Falk's graduate student, Martinez,
would arrive at the laboratory the next morning (8:17:43 A.M.,
delayed by a traffic accident on Route 1 that the machine had also
predicted).

The small tests worked, and each success increased Falk's confidence,
and each increase in confidence brought him closer to the question
that he had built the machine to answer and that he was, he now
realized, profoundly afraid to ask.

He asked it anyway, because he was a scientist, and a scientist who
builds a telescope and then declines to look through it is not a
scientist but a coward.

The question was this: What is the most probable future of human
civilization over the next five hundred years?

                            II.

The machine took eleven hours to compute the answer, which was
considerably longer than it had taken to predict the horse race and
which Falk attributed to the exponential increase in relevant
variables: a horse race involves a dozen horses, a few thousand
spectators, and a limited set of physical parameters; the future of
civilization involves seven billion people, a planet's worth of
resources, and a configuration space so vast that merely indexing its
dimensions required more storage than the machine possessed. The
machine compensated by calculating not the complete probability
distribution but the peak — the single trajectory with the highest
aggregate probability, the future that was, given the current state
of all relevant variables, most likely to occur.

Falk waited. He did not sleep. He drank coffee from a thermos and ate
a sandwich that Martinez had left for him, and he watched the status
indicators on the console and listened to the sub-audible hum of the
superconducting lattice and felt, as the hours passed, a growing
sensation of vertigo, as if he were standing at the edge of a very
high place and was about to look down.

At 3:47 A.M., the machine finished.

The output was a document — a probability-weighted narrative summary
generated by the machine's interpretation algorithms, which
translated the raw mathematical output into natural language. Falk
had designed these algorithms himself, calibrating them against
historical events whose outcomes were known, and he trusted them with
the same confidence he trusted the rest of the machine, which was to
say: completely.

He read the document.

He read it again.

He sat down in his chair and stared at the wall of the laboratory
for a very long time, and the sub-audible hum of the machine pressed
against his chest like a hand.

The most probable future of human civilization was not apocalyptic.
This was the first surprise and, in some ways, the cruelest. Falk
had steeled himself for catastrophe — nuclear war, ecological
collapse, pandemic, the various dramatic extinctions that had
populated the nightmares of every generation since Hiroshima. He had
been prepared for horror. He had not been prepared for what the
machine actually predicted.

What the machine predicted was this:

No nuclear war. Not because the weapons would be dismantled (they
wouldn't be, not for another two centuries), but because the web of
deterrence, economic interdependence, and institutional inertia that
had prevented their use thus far would continue to prevent their use,
growing stronger with each decade that passed without detonation,
until the weapons became what they had always secretly been:
ceremonial objects, symbols of a capacity that would never be
exercised, the thermonuclear equivalent of the appendix.

No ecological apocalypse. Not because humanity would heroically reverse
its environmental damage (it wouldn't, not entirely), but because it
would adapt — messily, expensively, inadequately, but sufficiently.
The oceans would rise. Species would go extinct. Summers would become
brutal. But humanity would build seawalls and air conditioners and
synthetic ecosystems and would learn to live in the diminished world
it had created, the way a man who has lost a limb learns to live
without it — not happily, not gracefully, but functionally.

No pandemic extinction. No asteroid impact. No artificial intelligence
uprising. No alien invasion. No singularity, technological or
otherwise.

What the machine predicted was not the end of civilization but its
slow, comfortable, thoroughly unremarkable continuation. A long,
gradual, asymptotic approach to a stable state. Population would peak
and then decline — gently, voluntarily, through the universal
availability of contraception and the universal decrease in economic
incentives for reproduction. Technology would advance — incrementally,
producing improvements in medicine and transportation and communication
that would be, by any historical standard, miraculous, and that would
be received by the populations that benefited from them with the
bovine contentment of people for whom the miraculous has become
routine. Governments would persist, adjusting their institutions to
new circumstances with the glacial adaptability of all large
bureaucracies. Wars would continue — small wars, regional wars, wars
about borders and resources and ethnic grievance — but they would
diminish in frequency and scale, not because humanity had conquered
its belligerence but because the economic calculus of war would become
increasingly unfavorable.

The machine predicted, in short, a future that was not terrible and not
wonderful but merely adequate. A future of central heating and dental
care and moderately interesting television. A future in which no one
starved and no one conquered and no one ascended and no one
transcended, and the species that had split the atom and walked on the
moon and sequenced its own genome would settle, with a collective sigh
that was not quite satisfaction and not quite resignation, into a long,
slow, comfortable, unremarkable dotage.

Falk read the document three times. Each reading made it worse.

He got up from his chair and walked around the machine. Twelve meters
on a side. Six meters high. Forty-seven tons of superconducting wire,
cryogenic coolant, quantum processors, and shielding, built at a cost
of fourteen million dollars over seven years, funded by a Defense
Department grant that had been predicated on the assumption that the
machine's primary application would be military — the prediction of
enemy movements, the anticipation of strikes, the calculation of
optimal force deployments — and that Falk had accepted with the full
knowledge that he would never use the machine for any such purpose,
because the question he cared about was not how to win the next war
but whether war itself, in the long run, mattered.

It did not. The machine said it did not. Wars would occur and they
would end and the endings would be neither victories nor defeats but
exhaustions, and the exhaustions would fade into the background hum of
a civilization that had enough energy to sustain itself and not enough
ambition to transform itself, and the men who fought the wars and the
men who funded the machines that predicted the wars and the men who
sat in laboratories at four in the morning reading the predictions
would all be absorbed, eventually, into the vast, comfortable, adequate
average.

He pressed his hand against the casing. The metal was cold. The
sub-audible hum transmitted itself through his palm and into the
bones of his wrist and up his arm to his shoulder, and for a moment
he felt what he imagined a doctor feels when listening to a heartbeat
through a stethoscope: the intimate awareness of a system working,
of energy flowing through channels, of something that was not alive
but that had the functional characteristics of life — rhythmic,
self-sustaining, purposeful.

Purposeful. That was the word that stuck. The machine had a purpose.
It had been built to do a specific thing, and it did that thing
with flawless precision. The human species, as described by the
machine's output, had no such purpose. It had goals — survival,
comfort, reproduction, the management of resources — but goals were
not purpose. Goals were the operational requirements of a system.
Purpose was the reason the system existed. A thermostat had goals: to
maintain a specific temperature. A thermostat did not have a purpose.
It did not ask why the temperature mattered. It did not wonder whether
maintaining the temperature was worth the energy required to do so.

Was civilization a thermostat? Was the most probable future the
thermostatic future — the endless maintenance of comfortable
conditions, the regulation of variables within acceptable ranges,
the system functioning perfectly without ever asking what it was
functioning for?

Falk removed his hand from the casing. The cold lingered in his
fingers. He thought about his father, who had been a machinist in
Cleveland and who had spent forty years making parts for engines that
went into trucks that carried goods that were consumed by people who
went to work to earn money to buy goods that were carried by trucks
with engines made of parts that his father machined, and who had
died at sixty-seven of a heart attack on the factory floor without,
as far as Falk could tell, ever wondering what the whole system was
for. His father had been a competent man. A satisfied man. An adequate
man.

And Falk had loved him. And Falk had been terrified of becoming him.
And the machine, with its perfect calculations and its devastating
output, had just told him that the entire species was on track to
become his father: competent, satisfied, adequate, and dead without
having asked the question.

He went to find Greenberg.

                            III.

"What did you expect?" Greenberg asked.

They were in the faculty lounge — a room that Falk normally avoided
because it smelled of old cigarettes and the coffee was terrible, but
which he had sought out today because it contained Greenberg, and
Greenberg was the only person he could talk to about this, because
Greenberg was the only person who knew the machine existed.

"I expected something," Falk said. "I expected either catastrophe or
transcendence. Fire or paradise. The bomb or the stars. Something
that mattered."

Greenberg stirred his coffee with a pencil, a habit that Falk found
simultaneously irritating and endearing. "And instead you got
mediocrity."

"I got adequacy. Which is worse than mediocrity, because mediocrity at
least implies a standard against which it falls short, whereas adequacy
is its own standard. Adequate means sufficient. Adequate means enough.
And enough is — " He stopped. He did not know how to finish the
sentence.

"Enough is enough," Greenberg said, and smiled, and Falk wanted to
hit him.

"You don't understand. This is not about my personal expectations.
This is about — " He gestured, a movement that encompassed the
faculty lounge and the university and the country and the planet and
the species. "This is about whether any of it matters. Whether
civilization has a purpose beyond perpetuation. We build, Greenberg.
We discover. We create. We reach for things we cannot see because the
reaching is what makes us human. And the machine says that the
reaching stops. Not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with a
comfortable settling — a species that has decided, collectively and
without conscious deliberation, that it has reached far enough, that
the view from here is acceptable, that the remaining distance to the
stars is not worth the effort."

"Maybe the reaching doesn't stop," Greenberg said. "Maybe it just
changes direction. Maybe humanity reaches inward instead of outward.
Art, philosophy, relationships, the interior life. Maybe the stars
were never the point."

"The stars were always the point. The stars are the only point. A
civilization that does not look up is not a civilization. It is a
mechanism. It is a system for the efficient processing of matter and
energy, and the only thing that distinguishes it from a very large
and complicated chemical reaction is the aspiration — the desire to
become something more than what it is. Remove the aspiration, and
you have — " He waved at the faculty lounge. " — this. Adequate.
Sufficient. Enough. A room full of people drinking bad coffee and
waiting for nothing in particular."

Greenberg was quiet for a moment. "You know," he said, "there is
another way to read the output."

"Which is?"

"The machine calculated the most probable future. Not the only possible
future. Not the best possible future. The most probable. Which means
that every other future — every catastrophe, every transcendence, every
impossible, improbable, magnificent deviation from the predicted
trajectory — is also possible. Less likely, yes. But possible.
The machine hasn't told you what will happen. It's told you what will
happen if nothing unexpected occurs. And the whole history of
civilization is, if you look at it honestly, a history of the
unexpected."

Falk considered this. He considered it with the thoroughness of a man
who had spent seven years building a machine to ask a question and
who had received an answer he could not accept and who was now,
despite his training, despite his commitment to empirical rigor,
despite his bone-deep conviction that data was not something you
argued with but something you submitted to, looking for a reason to
argue.

"The unexpected," he said slowly, "is by definition improbable."

"Yes."

"The machine predicts probabilities."

"Yes."

"The most probable future is the one I've described."

"Yes."

"And you're suggesting that the value of civilizaton lies not in
the most probable future but in the improbable ones. In the deviations.
In the outliers."

"I'm suggesting that a species that has produced Mozart and Euclid
and the Brooklyn Bridge and the Saturn V rocket is not a species
whose future is adequately described by its most probable trajectory.
I'm suggesting that the whole point of being human is that we do
improbable things. We always have. The most probable future of any
species, at any point in its history, is stasis. Growth, equilibrium,
decline. That's the probable trajectory of every organism, every
ecosystem, every civilization. And yet here we are, having split the
atom and walked on the moon and built a machine that can calculate
the probability of its own existence, which I assure you was
vanishingly small."

Falk said nothing. The coffee was terrible. The faculty lounge was
adequate.

"The question," Greenberg continued, and his voice had lost its
habitual lightness and taken on a quality that Falk had heard only
rarely, in their best conversations, in the moments when Greenberg
stopped being the wry, self-deprecating physicist who stirred his
coffee with a pencil and became the thinker Falk had always known
he was — "the question is not what the machine predicts. The
question is what you do with the prediction. Do you accept it? Do
you treat it as inevitable? Do you let the most probable future
become the only future, the way a prophecy becomes self-fulfilling
when the people who hear it stop trying? Or do you look at the
probability distribution and say: there, in the tail, in the
improbable region, in the space where the calculation says almost
certainly not — there is where I want to live. There is where I
want civilization to go. And the fact that it is improbable is not
an argument against it. It is the whole point."

                            IV.

Falk went back to the laboratory. The machine hummed. The lattice
glowed. The answer sat in the console's memory, patient and exact,
a number between zero and one that represented the most probable
future of everything.

He sat in his chair and stared at the machine — his machine, the
product of seven years of work, the most sophisticated predictive
instrument ever constructed by human hands — and he thought about
Greenberg's words, and he thought about probability, and he thought
about what it meant to build a telescope that showed you a view you
did not want to see.

The machine was not wrong. He was certain of this. The calculation
was rigorous, the data complete, the methodology sound. The most
probable future of human civilization was precisely what the machine
said it was: a long, slow, comfortable, adequate, unremarkable
persistence. Not a bang. Not a whimper. A sigh.

But.

But the machine calculated probabilities, and probabilities were not
destinies. The most probable future was the one that would occur if
every variable evolved according to its expected trajectory, if every
trend continued, if every pattern held. And variables did not always
evolve according to their expected trajectories. Trends did not always
continue. Patterns did not always hold. This was not mysticism. This
was not wishful thinking. This was physics: the universe was not
deterministic, the wave function did not collapse into the most
probable outcome every time, and the gap between the probable and the
actual was the space in which everything interesting happened.

Falk looked at the machine. The machine looked back — not literally,
not with eyes, but with the patient, humming presence of an
intelligence that had calculated the future and found it wanting and
was now waiting, with the inhuman patience of superconducting wire, for
its creator to decide what to do about it.

He could publish the results. He could present the most probable
future to the world and let humanity absorb the knowledge that its
destiny was adequacy. He could give the species a prediction and
watch, with the clinical detachment of a scientist, as the prediction
became self-fulfilling — as people heard that the future was merely
adequate and responded by ceasing to reach for anything more, because
why reach when the machine has told you that the reaching changes
nothing?

Or he could do what Greenberg suggested. He could look at the
probability distribution — the full distribution, not just the peak —
and find the trajectories that led somewhere else. The improbable ones.
The ones where civilization did not sigh into comfortable decline but
leapt, improbably, magnificently, into something that the machine's
algorithms could not predict because it had never happened before,
because it was new, because it was the kind of thing that only happened
when a species looked at the most probable future and said: no.

He pulled up the full probability distribution. It was vast —
billions of trajectories, each one a possible future, each one
weighted by its probability. The peak was where he expected it: the
long, slow, comfortable decline, the most probable trajectory, the
sigh. But the tails of the distribution — the low-probability regions,
the outliers, the deviations — were populated with futures that were
anything but adequate.

There: a trajectory in which humanity developed faster-than-light
travel within two centuries. Probability: 0.003. Improbable. But not
zero. Not impossible. A future that existed in the mathematics, a
pathway through configuration space that was narrow and unlikely and
real.

There: a trajectory in which first contact with an extraterrestrial
intelligence occurred within fifty years. Probability: 0.0007. Even
less likely. But the pathway existed. The mathematics permitted it.
The universe allowed it, the way a lottery allows a winner: most
people lose, but the winning ticket is real.

There: a trajectory in which humanity underwent a fundamental
cognitive transformation — a leap in consciousness, a reorganization
of the neural architecture, a change in the basic categories through
which the species perceived and understood the universe. Probability:
0.00001. Vanishingly small. A whisper in the noise. But the whisper
was there, and the whisper said: this is possible. This is allowed.
This exists in the mathematics, and the mathematics does not lie.

Falk sat in the laboratory, surrounded by the hum of the machine and
the glow of the lattice and the vast, branching tree of possible
futures, and he understood, for the first time, what the machine had
really shown him. Not a prediction. Not a destiny. A choice. The most
probable future was one kind of choice — the choice to continue, to
persist, to accept the trajectory that inertia and trend and precedent
had established. But the improbable futures were also choices — choices
that required effort, that required deviation, that required the
deliberate, conscious, improbable decision to do something that the
mathematics said was almost certainly not going to happen.

The machine could not make that choice. The machine could only
calculate the probabilities. The choice was human. The choice was
always human. The machine had shown him the landscape of possibility,
and the landscape was vast, and the probable path through it was
boring, and the improbable paths were magnificent, and the decision of
which path to walk was not a calculation but an act of will.

He turned off the machine. The hum ceased. The lattice went dark. The
laboratory was quiet.

He sat in the quiet for a long time. Then he began to write.

Not the paper he had planned — the triumphant announcement of a
machine that could predict the future with perfect accuracy. Not the
data, not the methodology, not the results. He wrote something else.
A different paper. A paper about probability and choice and the
difference between predicting a future and choosing one. A paper
about the most probable trajectory and the improbable ones, about the
peak of the distribution and the tails, about adequacy and
aspiration and the terrible, wonderful, improbable things that human
beings did when they refused to accept the most probable outcome.

He did not publish the machine's predictions. He would never publish
them. The most probable future was, he now believed, the most
dangerous piece of information he had ever encountered — not because
it was frightening, but because it was comfortable, and comfort was
the enemy of aspiration, and aspiration was the only thing that had
ever moved the species from one kind of future to another.

He would publish the paper about choice. He would let the world know
that the most probable future was calculable, and he would not tell
them what it was, and the not-telling would be the most important
thing he ever did as a scientist, because a species that knew its most
probable destiny was a species that would settle for it, and a species
that did not know was a species that might, just might, choose
something better.

He thought about his father again. His father at the lathe, making
parts. His father's hands, scarred and precise, shaping metal into
tolerances of a thousandth of an inch. His father had been an adequate
man, and Falk had been wrong to fear becoming him, because his father
had also been the man who, every Sunday evening, sat on the back porch
and looked up at the sky and said nothing, and the nothing he said
was loud, was enormous, was the silence of a man who knew that the
stars were there and who looked at them anyway, even though looking
changed nothing, even though the looking was improbable — what
evolutionary advantage, what thermostatic function, what adequacy-
maximizing algorithm would produce a machinist who looked at stars?

None. The looking was improbable. The looking was the whole point.

His father had been adequate and his father had looked up and the
combination of those two facts was, Falk now understood, not a
contradiction but a description of the species: adequate and reaching,
comfortable and yearning, thermostatic and stargazing, improbable in
every way that mattered and adequate in every way that didn't, and
the machine could calculate the adequacy but it could not calculate
the looking-up, because the looking-up was not a variable, was not a
trend, was not a pattern that could be extrapolated, was the one thing
in the universe that was genuinely, irreducibly, magnificently
unpredictable.

Greenberg would laugh at him. Greenberg would say that withholding data
was the worst thing a scientist could do, that the purpose of knowledge
was to be known, that a man who built a telescope and then covered the
eyepiece was not a hero but a fool.

And Falk would say: perhaps. But a man who looks through a telescope
and sees a view that makes him stop reaching for the stars has gained
knowledge and lost something more important. And the something more
important has no name in the vocabulary of science, but it is the thing
that built the telescope in the first place, and it is the thing that
sent a man to the moon, and it is the thing that keeps a species
looking up when the probabilities say that looking up changes nothing.

He left the laboratory. The sun was coming up. The campus was empty
and quiet, the buildings standing in the early light like monuments
to an idea that was improbable and persistent and magnificent and
doomed and alive, alive, still reaching, still looking up, still
refusing, against all probability, to settle for enough.

The other has been waiting too. Or has it? To say that the other
"waits" is to impose a temporal framework — anticipation, duration,
arrival — that may or may not apply. The other may experience time

                              only in the moment of
                    first
          seeing.

The human sees:       a shape. (Wrong.) A light. (Wrong.) A
                      presence. (Closer.) A                .
                      (Closest.)

The other sees:       [untranslatable]

The overlap sees:     [the story you are reading]


The color fills the room. Not like light — light has a source, a
direction, a geometry of emanation and reception. This color has no
source. It is not emitted by the other or perceived by the human.
It is produced by the overlap, by the interference pattern of two
perceptual systems occupying the same space, and it is therefore
native to neither system and alien to both.

Sara Chen (who was Dr. Chen, who was the astrobiologist, who was the
human, who was the first-person pronoun searching for its verb)
stands in the color and

     breathes it. (Her lungs do not know the difference between
     air and this. Perhaps there is no difference. Perhaps this
     is what air has always been and the limitation was in the
     perceiving.)

     tastes it. (Copper. Old books. The sea at Kaohsiung where
     her grandmother took her as a child. No — these are
     translations, metaphors, the brain scrambling to map the
     unmappable onto the familiar. The color tastes like itself.
     The color tastes like a new primary.)

     hears it. (Low, resonant, the sound a cathedral would make
     if it could hum. But this is the sound section's territory.
     We are still in color. We are still in

                                   the first moment of the
                                   first color of the first
                                   contact, which is taking
                                   longer to describe than
                                   it took to experience,
                                   because experience is
                                   instant and description
                                   is sequential and the
                                   gap between them is

                         language,

                    which is

          the oldest distance

     in the world.)


The other does not stand. The other does not breathe. The other does
not taste. The other does something for which no human verb exists —
a verb that would be conjugated in a tense that English does not
possess, the tense of simultaneous being and perceiving, the tense
of experiencing-as-a-form-of-existing, which is what the other does
in place of seeing and hearing and touching and breathing and standing
and all the separate, sequential verbs by which the human organizes
its encounter with the world:

the other            [verbs].

And the [verbing] is beautiful.


                              *


SECOND: the sound.

The human makes a sound. The sound is involuntary — an exhalation, a
gasp, the animal noise that the body produces when the mind encounters
something that exceeds its categories. The sound has no linguistic
content. It is pre-language. It is the sound that preceded language
by a hundred thousand years, the sound that the first human made when
it looked up and saw the stars and understood, in the wordless way
that the body understands danger or beauty, that the universe was
larger than the self.

The other makes a sound. The sound is                not a sound.
It is a modulation of the medium between them — the electromagnetic
soup, the quantum foam, the fabric of spacetime itself vibrating at
a frequency that is not audible but is     felt,
the way grief is felt, the way joy is felt, the way the proximity
of another consciousness is felt in a dark room when you cannot see
the face but you know,             you know,
                                        someone is there.

The sounds overlap. The human's gasp and the other's modulation
occupy the same moment and the same space and they interfere —
constructively, destructively, both at once — and the interference
pattern is:


                         music.


Not music in the sense of organized sound. Music in the sense of
organized experience. Music in the sense of two systems vibrating
in proximity and producing, through their interaction, something that
neither system could produce alone. The music has no melody. It has
no rhythm. It has no key, no tempo, no structure that any theory of
music has ever described. And yet it is                unmistakably
                                        music,
because music is not a thing but a relationship, and the relationship
between these two systems of perception, in this moment of first
overlap, is the most musical thing that has ever occurred in the
history of the universe,

which is itself, considered properly, a history of music — the music
of hydrogen fusing into helium, the music of galaxies spiraling, the
music of water finding its level and light finding its path and
matter finding its form, all of it music, all of it the sound of
things interacting, the sound of


                    contact.


Sara Chen is crying. The tears are involuntary. They are the body's
response to an experience that the mind cannot contain — the overflow
of sensation into fluid, the conversion of the inexpressible into
salt water, which is, if you think about it (and Sara is thinking
about everything, is thinking at a speed and depth and breadth that
she has never thought before, because the resonance is amplifying
her cognition the way a concert hall amplifies a voice), the oldest
language in the human body. Older than speech. Older than gesture.
The language of the ocean that the species crawled out of, the salt
memory of the sea still present in the chemistry of tears.

She is crying and the other is

                         [responding].

Not with tears. The other does not produce salt water. The other
produces               something
that Sara perceives as a color (but is not a color) and a sound
(but is not a sound) and a temperature (but is not a temperature)
and that she will later, in the report she writes for the Terran
Survey, describe as "a quality of attention so intense that it
was indistinguishable from tenderness" —

and the word tenderness will be wrong, will be laughably inadequate,
will be the report's way of throwing its hands up and saying: I
cannot describe what happened in that room, I can only tell you
that it was tender, it was the tenderest thing I have ever
experienced, it was the tenderness of two wounds pressed together,
of two openings facing each other, of two vulnerabilities that
recognized in each other the same capacity for damage and for
healing,

and the report will be filed and archived and read by committees
and debated by scholars and none of them will understand, because
understanding requires presence and they were not present, they were
not in the room, they were not in the


                              overlap.

Only Sara was in the overlap. And the other. And the self between
them, the resonant self, the singing space, the


                                             us


that came into being in the first fraction of the first second and
that will persist, will persist, will persist beyond the room and
the ship and the orbit and the report and the committees and the
scholars and the history, because contact, once made, cannot be
unmade, because consciousness, once expanded, does not fully contract,
because a tuning fork, once set ringing, rings forever in some
diminishing but never-quite-vanishing vibration that is the memory
of the frequency it learned from the air —


                              *


THIRD: the touch.

Not physical. There is no physical contact. The distance between them
is (choose your unit)

          four meters
          zero
          infinite
          irrelevant

because the touch is not the meeting of surfaces but the meeting of
              systems
                    of
                         perception,

and when two systems of perception touch, the distance between the
bodies that house them is as irrelevant as the distance between two
radio stations is to the listener who hears them both at once:

                    the signals overlap.
                    The overlap is the touch.
                    The touch is the story.

The human feels:

     warmth. (But not temperature.)
     pressure. (But not force.)
     recognition. (But of what? Of whom? Recognition
     without referent, the pure sensation of being
     known by something that has never known you,
     the paradox of familiarity without precedent,
     the feeling of coming home to a house you
     have never entered.)

The other feels:

     [Imagine a color you have never seen.
     Now imagine that the color is a feeling.
     Now imagine that the feeling is a thought.
     Now imagine that the thought is a place.
     Now imagine that you are standing in that place
     and someone is calling your name,
     except that you have no name,
     except that the calling
     is
     the
     name.]


                              *


INTERLUDE: the self.

(Who is experiencing this? The question seems simple. It is the
most complex question that can be asked.)

Before contact, there were two selves. The human self: bounded,
individual, located in a body, extending through time in a single
direction, defined by the distinction between I and not-I, between
inside and outside, between the knower and the known. This self
has a history. It was born in Taipei in a room with green curtains.
It skinned its knees. It learned to read. It chose a profession.
It traveled to the stars. It stood in a white room and waited.
This self has edges. This self knows where it ends.

The other self: [description unavailable]. Not because the other
has no self, but because the other's self is organized by principles
that do not translate into the descriptive framework of English
prose. The other's self may not be individual. It may not be bounded.
It may not distinguish between I and not-I, between the experiencer
and the experienced. It may be — this is speculation, this is the
human mind reaching across the unbridgeable gap with the only tools
it possesses, which are metaphors, which are wrong, which are all
we have — it may be that the other's self is what a human would
call a field: a continuous, unbounded, everywhere-present awareness
that does not occupy a body but permeates a region, the way a
magnetic field permeates the space around a magnet, and that the
question "where is the other?" is as meaningless as the question
"where is gravity?"

During contact, there are not two selves. There are not one.
There are

                         something else.

The overlap of the two perceptual systems produces not a merging
(the selves do not dissolve into each other) and not a collision
(the selves do not damage each other) but a

                    resonance.

The way two tuning forks placed near each other will begin to
vibrate at the same frequency, not because one has imposed its
vibration on the other but because the air between them carries
the vibration and the second fork recognizes it, responds to it,
joins it, and the resulting sound is neither fork alone but the
space between them singing:

     the space between Sara Chen and the other is singing.

The space between them is the self that neither of them possesses
alone, the self that exists only in the overlap, the self that
is produced by contact and that will cease to exist when contact
ends — or will it? Can a resonance be un-resonated? Can a tuning
fork forget the frequency it learned from the air? Can a self
that has been expanded by the presence of another self ever fully
contract to its original dimensions?

(Sara Chen does not know. Sara Chen is standing in a white room
in orbit around an unnamed planet, and her self is larger than it
has ever been, and she does not know if it will shrink back, and
she does not know if she wants it to, and she does not know if
wanting is even the right category for what is happening to her,
because wanting implies a self that wants, and the self that is
wanting is the expanded self, the resonant self, the self that
includes the space between, and that self may want things that
Sara Chen — the bounded, individual, located self — would never
want, could never want, because she could never have imagined
them from inside her own edges.)


                              *


The room is still white. The ship is still in orbit. The protocols
are still on page 401. Nothing has moved. Nothing has changed.
Everything has changed. The human and the other are in the same
positions they occupied when this text began — four meters apart,
or zero meters, or infinite meters, depending on how you measure
distance, depending on whether you measure the distance between
bodies or between minds, between surfaces or between selves, between
the edges of two perceptual systems or between their centers —

and the distance between their centers is:


                                        zero.


It has always been zero. Contact is not something that happened.
Contact is something that was always happening, that was happening
before the human entered the room, before the ship entered orbit,
before the species evolved, before the planet formed, before the
stars that warmed them both ignited in the dark. Contact is the
condition of consciousness itself: the state of being aware that
awareness exists, the realization that the universe contains not
just matter and energy but experience, and that experience, wherever
it occurs, is a kind of reaching, and reaching is a kind of touching,
and touching is a kind of


                    contact.


What is happening in this room is not the beginning of contact. It
is the recognition of contact. It is two forms of consciousness
recognizing that they have always already been touching, that the
space between them was never empty but was always full of the thing
that they are now, finally, learning to perceive:

each other.


                              *


FOURTH: the language.

There is no fourth. Language is what happens after contact, not during.
Language is the scar tissue that forms over the wound of experience.
Language is the map drawn after the territory has been crossed, the
photograph taken after the moment has passed, the word spoken after
the silence has said everything.

This is the silence. This is the moment before the map. This is the
wound before the scar, the territory before the photograph, the
everything before the word.

This is first contact, and it is not an event but a sensation, and it
is not a narrative but a music, and it is not a story but a color
that has no name, and the having-no-name is the point, because naming
is what we do after, and this is


                              during,


this is the raw, unmediated, un-languaged moment when two forms of
consciousness occupy the same space for the first time and discover
that consciousness is not a thing that one possesses but a thing that
one does,

and that the doing can be done                together,

and that the together is a color and a sound and a touch that no
single consciousness has ever produced and that no language has ever
described and that this text, these words, this arrangement of ink
on paper is failing, is failing beautifully, is failing the way that
all language fails in the presence of the thing it is trying to
describe, which is the presence of another mind, which is the oldest
experience in the universe, which is the experience of not being
alone,

and the not-being-alone is

                         (the story)

                                        (the music)

                    (the color)

          (the silence that is not silence)

                              (the contact)


                              *


                              *


                              *


They depart.

                    We depart.

                                        It departs.


(The pronouns are still wrong. But something has changed in the
wrongness. Before contact, the pronouns were wrong because language
could not accommodate the other. After contact, the pronouns are
wrong because language cannot accommodate


                              us.


We, who were they. They, who were we. The first-person plural that
did not exist before this moment and that, now that it exists, cannot
be un-existed, because contact is not an event that occurs and ends
but a state that, once entered, persists,

the way a color, once seen, persists in the eye even after the
light is gone,

the way a sound, once heard, persists in the ear even after the
silence returns,

the way a touch, once felt, persists in the skin even after the
distance reasserts itself,

the way a story, once read, persists in the mind even after the
page is turned,

                    persists,

                              persists,

                                        persists.)


                              *


The glass is many-colored.

Look through it.

What do you see?

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

JULIAN ST. CROIX is a British writer whose literary novel "The Hourglass
Garden" (Chatto & Windus, 1961) was described by the Times Literary
Supplement as "an astonishing debut." His turn to science fiction has
been equally astonishing: his stories for this magazine, beginning with
"The Cartography of Absence" in Issue #53, have established him as one
of the most daring structural innovators in the field. "Palindrome
Conspiracy" represents his most ambitious formal experiment to date —
a murder mystery that, like its subject, reads differently depending on
which direction you approach it. He lives in Bloomsbury, London, and is
at work on a novel he describes as "a love letter to entropy."

ELAINE PRESCOTT is a former engineer at MIT's Draper Laboratory whose
fiction explores the boundary between the human body and its
technological extensions. Her first story for these pages, "The
Prosthetic Heart" (Issue #57), established her as a writer of rare
precision and quiet power, and her subsequent work has deepened that
reputation with each installment. "Chrysalis" is her most ambitious
story to date — a complete modification journal that charts the
dissolution and reconstitution of a human identity. She lives in
Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she builds computers from salvaged
components and writes about the people inside them.

THEODORE CAIN has been writing for "Tales from the Future and Beyond"
since Issue #1, and if you have read any ten issues of this magazine,
you have almost certainly read a Theodore Cain story. He is our most
prolific contributor, our most versatile, and our most reliable — a
writer who can produce a solid, engaging story in virtually any sub-
genre on demand. "The Rememberers" is, in our editorial opinion, among
his finest work: a story of memory, accountability, and the cost of
forgetting that demonstrates what Mr. Cain can do when he turns his
considerable craft toward the deepest human questions. He lives in
Dearborn, Michigan, and works, when not writing, as a technical writer
for General Motors.

DOLORES REYES grew up in El Paso, Texas, on the border between two
countries, two languages, and two cultures, and her fiction has never
stopped exploring the space between. She studied anthropology at the
University of Texas and now divides her time between El Paso and Mexico
City, where she is part of the extraordinary literary community
surrounding the Latin American Boom. Her stories for this magazine —
beginning with "The Colony of Forgetting" in Issue #55 — bring a
perspective to science fiction that is urgently needed and entirely
original. "Skin Deep" is a story about borders of a different kind:
the border between species, between identities, between the self you
are born as and the self you become. It is, we believe, one of the
most moving stories we have ever published.

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a physicist at the California Institute of
Technology whose fiction has appeared in these pages since Issue #3
(March 1953). He is the gold standard for scientifically rigorous
science fiction: his stories are built on real physics, real
mathematics, and a real understanding of how scientists think and work.
"Probability Engine" is a departure for Koslov — less concerned with
the mechanics of the machine than with the philosophical implications
of its output — and it is, in this editor's opinion, evidence that
Dr. Koslov's art continues to deepen even as his science remains
impeccable. He describes the story as "the most frightening thing I
have ever written, because the monster is not destruction but
adequacy."

ZARA NIX is a mystery. The stories arrive at our office from a post
office box in San Francisco, typed on an IBM Selectric, accompanied by
no biographical information. We have published five Nix stories to date,
and each one has provoked more reader mail than the previous. We can
say only this: whoever Zara Nix is, they are writing some of the most
formally inventive fiction in the English language, and "Many-Colored
Glass" — a fragmented, kaleidoscopic account of first contact as pure
sensation — is their most beautiful and most challenging work to date.
We recommend reading it aloud, slowly, more than once.

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling and Miss Foxworth,

I must write to express my admiration for Dr. Koslov's "The Quiet After
Cascade" in your January issue. It is the finest piece of hard SF I
have read in years — possibly in a decade. The ethical dilemma at its
center is handled with a restraint and intelligence that one rarely
encounters in this or any genre. I have recommended it to my colleagues
in the astronomy department, several of whom are not regular readers
of science fiction and all of whom were deeply impressed. More Koslov,
please. Always more Koslov.

Dear Editors,

I write regarding Zara Nix's "Event Horizon" in your May issue.
I have read it four times. I have understood it zero times. I believe
it may be a work of genius. I also believe it may be a hoax. I am not
sure these are mutually exclusive. Could you at least confirm that
Zara Nix is a real person? The uncertainty is becoming a distraction
from my doctoral research.

Dear Tales,

Dolores Reyes's "The Colony of Forgetting" (Issue #55) has haunted me
since I read it in January. I am a Mexican-American woman, born in
Tucson, raised between two worlds, and I have never — never — read a
science fiction story that spoke to my experience the way this one does.
The scene in which the colonists unconsciously replicate the mission
system, with all its implications of erasure and assimilation, is one
of the most powerful things I have encountered in any literature. Thank
you for publishing writers who understand that the future belongs to
all of us.

                                 Tucson, Arizona

Dear Sterling & Foxworth,

I am writing to register a complaint. I have subscribed to "Tales
from the Future and Beyond" since Issue #1, and I have watched with
increasing dismay as the magazine has drifted from good, honest science
fiction into literary pretension. I do not require my science fiction to
be written by someone who appears to have swallowed a thesaurus and
is slowly regurgitating it onto the page (I refer to Mr. St. Croix).
I do not require my science fiction to be typographically disordered
(I refer to Miss — or Mr.? — Nix). I require my science fiction to
contain science, fiction, and a story that goes from A to B without
requiring a graduate degree in literary criticism to follow it. More
Cain, more Koslov, more stories with beginnings, middles, and ends.
Less art. More craft.

Dear Editors,

Julian St. Croix's "The Cartography of Absence" is the most important
science fiction story published in the last five years. I do not say
this lightly. The final passage, in which the cartographer realizes
that the ship's maps are being altered by the collective unconscious
of the passengers — that the geography of the ship reflects the
psychology of its inhabitants — is a moment of genuine philosophical
revelation disguised as genre fiction. More St. Croix. More New Wave.
More stories that treat the reader as an intelligent adult.

DUNE by Frank Herbert
(Chilton Books, 1965, $5.95)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Herbert has written a novel so vast, so intricately constructed, and
so relentlessly imagined that it seems to contain its own weather
system. Set on the desert planet of Arrakis — a world as fully realized
as Tolkien's Middle-earth, and considerably more hostile — "Dune"
follows the young Paul Atreides as he navigates a labyrinth of
political intrigue, ecological warfare, and messianic destiny. The
world-building is astonishing: Herbert has created not merely a planet
but an entire ecology, an entire economy, an entire theology, all of it
interconnected with the rigor of a systems theorist and the vision of a
poet. If the novel has a flaw, it is an excess of ambition — there are
passages that read more like appendices than narrative — but this is a
flaw one forgives readily in a work of such towering imagination. A
landmark. Essential reading.

THE THREE STIGMATA OF PALMER ELDRITCH by Philip K. Dick
(Doubleday, 1965, $4.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Dick continues his remarkable exploration of the fragile boundary
between reality and illusion with a novel that is, even by his
standards, deeply unsettling. In a future where colonists on Mars
escape their miserable existence through a drug-induced shared
hallucination, the arrival of a new and more powerful drug —
administered by the enigmatic Palmer Eldritch — raises the terrifying
possibility that reality itself has been permanently contaminated by
illusion. Dick's prose is not elegant (it never is), but his ideas are
breathtaking, and the central question of the novel — how do you know
what is real when reality can be chemically altered? — is one that will
only become more relevant as our pharmacological capabilities increase.
Disturbing, visionary, and impossible to forget.

THE GENOCIDES by Thomas M. Disch
(Berkley Medallion, 1965, $0.50)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Disch has written a cold, beautiful, profoundly unsettling novel
about the end of humanity — not with a nuclear bang or an alien
invasion, but with the quiet efficiency of agriculture. Enormous alien
plants have taken over the Earth, and the surviving humans are not
fighting a war against extraterrestrial intelligence; they are being
treated as pests. The novel's power lies in Disch's refusal to grant
his human characters any special significance: they are not heroes,
not survivors, not even particularly interesting to the forces that
are destroying them. They are weeds in someone else's garden. This is
not comfortable reading. It is not, in the traditional sense, even
hopeful. But it is brilliant, and its unflinching vision of human
insignificance is a necessary corrective to the genre's habitual
anthropocentrism. Highly recommended for readers who prefer their
science fiction honest.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Issue in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #60 — November 1965

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue, which will
be available in late October:

"THE CARTOGRAPHER'S LAMENT" by Julian St. Croix — A sequel, of sorts,
to "The Cartography of Absence," in which the cartographer's
apprentice discovers that the maps have begun to map not the ship but
the future. A meditation on prediction, representation, and the
tyranny of the known.

"NEURAL GARDEN" by Elaine Prescott — A woman who tends a garden of
cybernetic organisms discovers that her plants are developing
consciousness. A story about care, cultivation, and the responsibilities
we owe to the minds we create.

"NIGHT SHIFT" by Theodore Cain — A routine maintenance crew on an
orbital station encounters a derelict vessel from the future. What they
find inside will test everything they believe about time, causation,
and the meaning of a warning.

"THE SECOND TONGUE" by Dolores Reyes — A translator at a colonial
outpost discovers that the indigenous alien language cannot be learned
without surrendering part of one's own identity. A story about the
price of understanding.

Plus: a new story by Dr. Vincent Koslov, a letter from an astronomer
who would like to correct our orbital mechanics, and the conclusion of
our reader poll for best story of 1965. Cast your votes!
