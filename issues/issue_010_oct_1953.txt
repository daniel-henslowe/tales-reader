TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

It is October, and the veil grows thin.

Now, I know what some of you are thinking. "Sterling," you say, "this is a
science fiction magazine, not a collection of campfire stories. We come here
for rockets and ray guns and the honest extrapolation of scientific
possibility, not for ghosts and ghouls and things that go bump in the
night." To which I reply: have you ever actually BEEN in the night? Not the
comfortable darkness of your bedroom, mind you, with the familiar sounds of
the house settling around you. I mean the REAL night -- the night that
exists between the stars, the vast and howling emptiness that makes up
ninety-nine point nine nine nine percent of everything that is.

That is the dark we traffic in here at TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND.
And I put it to you, dear reader, that there is nothing -- NOTHING -- more
terrifying than the universe as it actually exists.

Consider: you are a thin sack of water and carbon balanced on a rock that
hurtles through an infinite void at sixty-seven thousand miles per hour.
The only thing between you and the killing cold of space is a laughably
thin smear of atmosphere that extends, in cosmic terms, about as far as
the fuzz on a peach. Everything beyond that boundary wants you dead. Not
out of malice, mind you -- out of utter, absolute indifference.

If that doesn't make your skin crawl, I submit that you haven't been
paying attention.

This month, in honor of that most ancient and essential of holidays, we
have assembled seven stories guaranteed to make you check the locks on your
airlock. Harrison Blackwood brings us a haunted house where no house should
be. Lucian Marsh offers body horror of the most literal kind. Theodore Cain
gives us jack o'lanterns that scream back. Arthur Wainwright turns a
factory into a cathedral of memory. Agnes Whitfield walks us through a city
that has been unmade. Bob Finley tunes his radio to a frequency from beyond
the grave. And Oscar Lennox invites us to the last costume party anyone
will ever throw.

Some of these stories will frighten you. Some will unsettle you. One or
two, I suspect, will stay with you long after you've put the magazine down
and turned out the lights. That is the point. Fear is the oldest emotion,
and the most honest. It reminds us that we are small, and that the
universe is large, and that between those two facts lies everything that
matters.

Happy Halloween, dear readers. Lock your airlocks. Check your oxygen.

And whatever you do -- don't answer the radio.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond
New York, September 1953

                    HOUSE BETWEEN STARS

                       by Harrison Blackwood

============================================================================

There are places in the cosmos where the light of no star has ever fallen,
and it was in such a place that Elias Vane found the house.

He had been charting the interstitial void between Sol and Alpha Centauri
for the better part of fourteen months -- fourteen months of absolute
solitude aboard the cartographic vessel *Meridian*, with nothing for
company but the soft hum of the engines and the ceaseless, maddening
silence of deep space. The Interstellar Cartographic Survey had sent him to
map gravitational anomalies along the projected corridor of future
colony-ship routes, and for fourteen months the work had been exactly as
tedious and exactly as lonely as the recruitment brochures had promised it
would not be. He drifted through the black like a mote in God's eye,
cataloguing variations in gravitational pull that differed by fractions so
infinitesimal that only machines could perceive them, and he recorded his
findings in logs that no one would read for years, and he ate his
reconstituted meals in a silence so profound that the sound of his own
chewing became a kind of torture.

It was, in short, precisely the sort of assignment that attracts a
particular type of person -- the type who has found the company of other
human beings to be, on balance, more trouble than it is worth. Elias Vane
was forty-three years old, twice divorced, and possessed of a temperament
that his second wife had once described, with characteristic precision, as
"an absolute void where a personality ought to be." He had not disagreed.
He had, in fact, taken it as something of a compliment. The void between
the stars did not require personality. It required patience, meticulous
attention to instrument readings, and a tolerance for loneliness that
bordered on the pathological. Elias Vane had all three in abundance.

Which is why, when the anomaly first appeared on his instruments at oh-
three-hundred hours on the four hundred and nineteenth day of his mission,
his first emotion was not fear but annoyance. Anomalies meant deviation
from the survey grid. Deviation meant recalculation. Recalculation meant
delay. And delay meant more time in this particular stretch of nothing,
which was distinguishable from every other stretch of nothing only by the
arbitrary coordinates the Survey had assigned to it.

The instruments told him that something was there -- something with mass,
something with a faint but unmistakable thermal signature, something that
occupied space in a region where nothing should occupy space. Not a star.
Not a rogue planet. Not a comet or asteroid or any of the other usual
vagabonds of the interstellar medium. Something else. Something that his
instruments could not quite categorize, which was itself unusual, because
his instruments had been designed to categorize everything.

He adjusted course. Protocol demanded it -- any object of unknown origin
encountered during a survey was to be investigated and documented. He told
himself that this was the only reason he changed heading, that it was
procedure and nothing more. But there was something else, too -- something
he would not have admitted to anyone, least of all himself. After fourteen
months of nothing, the prospect of *something* -- anything -- exerted a
gravitational pull of its own.

The *Meridian* was not a fast ship. It took eleven hours to close the
distance, and during those eleven hours Elias watched the object resolve
itself on his instruments with a growing sense of wrongness that he could
not articulate. The thermal signature was too regular. The mass was too
small for a natural body and too large for any man-made object that had
any business being out here. The spectroscopic analysis returned readings
that made no sense -- carbon, silicon, calcium, iron, traces of organic
compounds, all arranged in configurations that the computer flagged as
UNRECOGNIZED and then, upon repeated analysis, simply refused to comment
on at all.

At hour nine, the visual feeds resolved the object, and Elias Vane sat
very still in his chair for a long time and did not say anything.

It was a house.

A Victorian house, to be precise -- three stories tall, with a mansard
roof and a wraparound porch and gingerbread trim along the eaves. It
floated in the void with the serene indifference of a thing that had
every right to be there, as though the four light-years of empty space
between Sol and Alpha Centauri were merely an unusually large front yard.
The exterior was painted in colors that his instruments identified as deep
burgundy and cream, though in the flat, starless dark they registered as
shades of gray and darker gray. There was a chimney, and from the chimney
rose a thin column of smoke -- or something that looked like smoke -- that
curled upward (upward relative to what? there was no up out here) and
dissipated into the vacuum.

And there were lights in the windows. Every window. A warm, amber glow
that spilled out into the dark like something from a painting, like
something from a memory of a home that had never existed.

Elias stared at the house for forty-seven minutes. He knew this because
he checked the chronometer afterward. During those forty-seven minutes,
he cycled through every rational explanation he could construct --
hallucination, instrument malfunction, some elaborate and inexplicable
piece of space debris -- and found each one wanting. The house was there.
It was real. His instruments confirmed it from every angle and in every
spectrum. It sat in the void between the stars, and it glowed, and it
waited.

He should have reported it. Protocol was explicit: anomalous objects of
unknown origin were to be documented and reported via tightbeam to the
nearest relay station, and under no circumstances was a solo surveyor to
attempt direct investigation of a potentially hazardous object without
authorization. The nearest relay station was eight months away at
lightspeed. Authorization would take a minimum of sixteen months, round
trip. By which time the house might be gone, or might have drifted beyond
the range of his instruments, or might have done any number of things that
houses floating in the interstellar void were presumably capable of doing.

Elias Vane was not, by nature, a reckless man. But he was a lonely one,
and the lights in those windows called to something in him that fourteen
months of silence had worn down to bare, exposed wire.

He suited up. He cycled the airlock. He crossed the two hundred meters of
void between the *Meridian* and the front porch of the house in a state of
focused, deliberate calm that he recognized, distantly, as a form of
shock.

The porch had a welcome mat.

It read: WELCOME HOME, ELIAS.

He stood on the welcome mat for a long time. The wood of the porch -- and
it was wood, real wood, impossible wood -- creaked beneath his magnetic
boots. Through the faceplate of his helmet he could see the front door,
which was painted red and fitted with a brass knocker shaped like a lion's
head. There was a small window set into the door, curtained with lace, and
through the lace he could see the amber glow of the interior. The porch
swing, suspended on chains from the ceiling, swayed gently in a breeze
that did not exist.

He tried the door. It was unlocked.

The interior atmosphere hit him before he could stop it -- his suit
sensors registered breathable air, standard pressure, a temperature of
sixty-eight degrees Fahrenheit. The reading was so absurd that he checked
it three times, and three times the instruments confirmed what his body
already suspected: the inside of this house, floating in hard vacuum
between stars, contained a perfectly habitable pocket of air. It smelled,
he realized as he unsealed his helmet with hands that trembled only
slightly, of woodsmoke and cinnamon and something else, something older,
something that made him think of autumn leaves and the particular quality
of light that exists only in late October.

The foyer was exactly what one would expect of a well-appointed Victorian
home. A staircase curved upward to the second floor. A grandfather clock
ticked in the hallway with metronomic precision, its pendulum catching the
lamplight as it swung. There was a coat rack by the door with a single
coat hanging from it -- a man's overcoat, heavy wool, the kind of thing
one might wear on a cold November evening. The wallpaper was a William
Morris pattern, dark green with golden acanthus leaves, and in the dim
light of the gas lamps it seemed almost to breathe.

"Hello?" Elias said. His voice sounded small and strange in the enclosed
space, after so many months of hearing it only in the metallic confines
of the *Meridian's* cabin.

The house did not answer. But somewhere deeper inside, a floorboard
creaked, and the grandfather clock chimed once, and the sound was so
familiar, so achingly domestic, that Elias Vane -- who had not cried since
he was eleven years old -- felt his eyes sting with the threat of tears.

He moved deeper.

The parlor was furnished in period style -- overstuffed chairs, a settee,
a fireplace with a fire burning in it (a fire, in space, burning
actual wood that popped and sparked and gave off actual heat). Above the
mantelpiece hung a portrait in oils, and when Elias looked at it, the
shock that had been insulating him cracked like thin ice.

The portrait was of him.

Not him as he was now -- gaunt, gray-templed, hollowed out by solitude --
but him as he might have been, or as he once had been, or as someone
imagined he should be. The man in the portrait wore a dark suit and a
cravat and held a book in one hand, and his expression was one of calm,
contented intelligence, and his eyes were Elias's eyes, and his jaw was
Elias's jaw, and the scar on his left eyebrow, from a childhood accident
involving a screen door, was exactly where Elias's scar was.

"What is this?" he said, to no one, to the house, to the void outside
the windows where the amber light fell on nothing.

A voice answered. It came from everywhere and nowhere -- from the walls,
from the floor, from the clock and the fire and the very air itself. It
was a woman's voice, low and warm and faintly accented in a way that Elias
could not place, and it said:

"Welcome home, Elias. We've been expecting you."

"Who is 'we'?" His hand went to the utility knife on his belt, though
what good a knife would do against a disembodied voice in an impossible
house he could not have said.

"The house," the voice said, with a tone of gentle amusement. "Myself. We
are the same thing, more or less. Won't you sit down? You look tired. You
look as though you've been alone for a very long time."

He did not sit down. He backed toward the foyer, his boots loud on the
hardwood floor, and the house -- the voice -- made a sound that might have
been a sigh.

"You always do this," it said. "You always leave. But you always come
back, Elias. You always come back."

*Always.* The word lodged in his mind like a splinter. "What do you mean,
always? I've never been here before."

"Haven't you?"

The grandfather clock chimed again -- twice this time, though no time had
passed -- and Elias felt something shift in the house around him, a
tremor that was not physical but perceptual, as though the walls had
rearranged themselves while his eyes were focused elsewhere. The foyer
looked the same, but the quality of the light had changed, grown warmer,
more golden, and the coat on the rack was a different coat, and the
wallpaper pattern was subtly altered, and when he turned back to the
parlor the portrait above the mantelpiece was the same face but younger,
much younger, wearing the uniform of the Interstellar Cartographic
Survey, and the book in the young man's hand was a star chart.

"You've been mapping the space between," the voice said. "That's what you
do. That's what you've always done. But the space between is not empty,
Elias. It was never empty. You of all people should know that."

He should have left. Every rational impulse, every instinct honed by years
of training and months of solitary discipline, told him to seal his helmet,
cross the porch, return to the *Meridian*, and file the most extraordinary
anomaly report in the history of the Interstellar Cartographic Survey. He
should have left, and he knew it, and the house knew it too.

But the fire was warm. And the chair was soft. And the silence of this
place was a different kind of silence than the silence of the *Meridian*
-- not the dead, empty silence of a metal tube suspended in nothing, but
the living silence of a home at rest, the silence of a place where someone
has been and will be again, the silence between breaths.

Elias Vane sat down.

The chair received him like an old friend. It was leather, cracked with
age, molded by use into the shape of someone's body -- his body, he
realized, because it fit him perfectly, every contour aligned with the
specific architecture of his frame as though it had been waiting for
exactly him. The fire popped and a log settled and the clock ticked and
Elias felt something unclench in his chest that had been clenched for so
long he had forgotten it was there.

"Tell me what you are," he said. "Tell me what this place is."

"I am the house," the voice said. "I am the house between the stars. I
have been here for a very long time -- longer than your species, longer
than your world, longer than the star your world orbits. I was here before
the light that warms your planet was kindled, and I will be here after it
has gone dark."

"That's impossible."

"Is it? You're sitting in an impossible chair, in an impossible room, in
an impossible house, breathing impossible air. At what point does the
impossible simply become the unfamiliar?"

Elias had no answer for that. He watched the fire and tried to think
clearly, but clarity was difficult. The warmth of the room, the softness
of the chair, the hypnotic rhythm of the clock -- all conspired to blur
the edges of his vigilance, to soften the hard, bright panic that had
been sustaining him since he first saw the house on his instruments.

"You said 'always,'" he managed. "You said I always come back. What did
you mean?"

"I mean that you are not the first Elias Vane to sit in that chair. You
are not the first to cross the void alone and find me here. The space
between the stars is vast, and it folds in ways that your mathematics
cannot yet describe, and in those folds, time is not the rigid thing you
believe it to be. You have been here before. You will be here again. The
portraits are my record."

"Portraits? Plural?"

"Come. I'll show you."

He should not have followed. But the house was warm and the voice was kind,
and in the absence of any other human contact for fourteen months, kindness
was a force more powerful than gravity.

The staircase creaked beneath his weight, each step producing a groan of
old wood that was somehow comforting, somehow right. The second floor was
a corridor of closed doors, each one identical -- dark wood, brass
hardware, the same lion's-head motif as the front-door knocker. The voice
led him to the end of the corridor, to a door that was slightly ajar, and
beyond it was a gallery.

The room was vast -- impossibly vast, far larger than the exterior of the
house could contain, stretching away into a distance that the amber
lamplight could not quite reach. And on every wall, hung in gilded frames,
were portraits. Dozens of them. Scores. Each one depicting a man who was
recognizably Elias Vane -- the same eyes, the same jaw, the same scar on
the left eyebrow -- but different. Different ages, different eras,
different styles of dress. Here was Elias in what appeared to be Roman
armor. There was Elias in the robes of a medieval scholar. Further down
the wall, Elias in the uniform of a Union soldier, then Elias in the
leather jacket of a barnstorming pilot, then Elias in a suit that
suggested the nineteen-twenties, and on and on, dozens of variations on
the same essential person, each painted with a skill and attention to
detail that suggested not mere portraiture but devotion.

And at the end of the gallery, on the far wall, was a single empty frame.

"That one is yours," the voice said. "When you're ready."

The dread came then -- not the sharp, bright fear of immediate danger but
something deeper, something cold and ancient that started in his bowels
and spread upward through his chest and into his throat. Because the
portraits were not merely similar to him. They were *him*. Not
doppelgangers, not alternate versions, not artistic interpretations. Every
face in every frame was his face, with his specific scars and his specific
asymmetries and the precise way his left eye sat slightly lower than his
right. And each pair of painted eyes seemed to follow him as he walked,
and each pair of painted lips seemed to curl with a knowledge that he did
not share.

"What happened to them?" he asked, and his voice was barely a whisper.
"The others. The other... me."

"They stayed," the voice said. "Eventually, they all stayed."

"And then what?"

A pause. The clock, from somewhere downstairs, chimed again. The fire
crackled. The house settled around him with sounds that might have been
wood contracting in the cold of space or might have been something else
entirely.

"Then they became part of the house," the voice said. "As all things do,
in time."

Elias looked at the empty frame. It was exactly the right size. He could
picture himself in it -- seated in the leather chair, perhaps, with the
fire behind him, a book in his hand, wearing an expression of calm,
contented intelligence. He could picture it so clearly that for a moment
he thought it had already happened, that the portrait was already there,
that he was looking at himself looking out from the frame with eyes that
knew something he did not yet know.

"No," he said. "I'm leaving."

He turned and walked back down the corridor. The doors on either side
seemed to lean inward, the brass handles glinting like eyes, but he
did not stop. He descended the staircase with a measured pace that was
only slightly faster than necessary, and he crossed the foyer, and he
reached for the front door.

It was locked.

"Let me out."

"You can leave whenever you wish," the voice said. "You have always been
free to leave. But consider what you're leaving to. Fourteen months of
silence. Years of the same. The empty space between the stars, which you
have chosen over the company of your own kind, again and again, in life
after life. You choose the void, Elias. You always choose the void. I
am simply what the void contains when you go looking."

He tried the door again. It opened easily -- it had been unlocked all
along, or perhaps it had unlocked itself, and the difference between those
two possibilities was not one that Elias wished to examine closely. The
porch was as he had left it, the welcome mat still bearing his name, the
swing still swaying in its nonexistent breeze. Beyond the porch railing,
the void stretched in every direction, absolute and total, and somewhere
in that void the *Meridian* hung like a silver needle, waiting.

He stood on the porch and looked out at nothing and felt the warmth of the
house at his back.

"Who are you?" he said again, but this time the question was different.
Not *what are you* but *who* -- not a request for classification but for
identity, for relationship, for the particular kind of knowledge that
exists between persons rather than between a person and an object.

"I am the place that waits," the voice said. "I am the hearth in the
darkness. I was here before your first life, and I will be here after
your last, and in between, I am what you come home to when the mapping
is done. Every cartographer needs a fixed point, Elias. Every journey
requires a place to return to. I am that place. I have always been that
place."

"I don't believe in reincarnation."

"Neither did the Roman. Or the scholar. Or the pilot. Belief is not
required. Only return."

The cold of space pressed against his back even through the inexplicable
atmosphere of the porch. In the distance -- though distance was meaningless
here, in the gap between stars -- the *Meridian's* running lights blinked
their slow, mechanical rhythm. His ship. His mission. His sixteen
remaining months of charting gravitational anomalies in absolute solitude.

He turned back to the house. The door stood open. The foyer glowed.

"If I come inside," he said carefully, "if I sit down again -- can I
leave? Truly leave, whenever I want?"

"You can always leave. You always have left. The question is not whether
you can leave, but whether you will want to."

There was something in the voice -- not menace, exactly, but certainty.
The certainty of a thing that has watched the same pattern repeat across
millennia, that knows how the story ends because it has seen every
possible ending and they are all the same. It was the certainty of
gravity, of entropy, of all the forces that pull things inevitably toward
their natural state.

Elias stepped back inside.

The house was different now, though the differences were subtle -- the
wallpaper a shade darker, the clock's ticking a fraction slower, the
fire burning with a deeper, redder light. Or perhaps the house was
exactly the same and it was Elias who had changed. He sat in the chair
again and it fit him again and the fire warmed him again and the clock
marked time that might or might not have been passing.

"Tell me about them," he said. "The others."

And the house told him.

It spoke of the Roman, a surveyor sent to map the edges of an empire that
thought itself eternal, who had wandered beyond the last frontier post and
found, in a valley that appeared on no map, a villa with smoke rising from
its chimney. It spoke of the scholar, a monk tasked with cataloguing the
contents of a library so vast that no single lifetime could encompass it,
who had found, in the deepest sub-basement, a room furnished with a chair
and a fire and a portrait that bore his face. It spoke of the pilot, a
woman -- for Elias had not always been a man, the house explained, and the
scar on the left eyebrow was the only constant -- who had flown solo
across an ocean and found, in the fog above the waves, a structure that
should not have existed, with lights in every window and a welcome mat
that bore her name.

"We are drawn to the spaces between," the house said. "You and I. The
mapped and the unmappable. The charted and the unknown. You cross the
voids and I fill them. We are complementary functions of the same
equation."

"That's poetic," Elias said. "But it isn't an explanation."

"No," the house agreed. "It isn't. Would you like an explanation?"

"Yes."

"Then look at the fire."

He looked. The flames moved as flames always move, licking and curling and
consuming, but as he watched, the patterns in the fire began to resolve
into something -- not an image, exactly, but a geometry, a structure, a
way of understanding the relationship between heat and light and fuel that
was also, somehow, a way of understanding the relationship between the
house and the void and the man sitting in the chair. He saw -- or felt,
or understood, or was shown -- that the universe was not a thing but a
process, not a structure but a pattern, and that within the pattern there
were nodes, points where the process doubled back on itself, and that
these nodes were not places but relationships, and that the house was
such a node, and that he was another, and that the two of them were bound
together by a symmetry as fundamental as the symmetry between matter and
energy or between space and time.

The fire showed him this, and more. It showed him the shape of the void as
the house perceived it -- not empty but full, not silent but singing, a
medium through which unimaginable forces propagated in patterns too vast
and too slow for human senses to detect. It showed him that the space he
had been mapping was not a gap between places but a place in itself, a
country with its own geography and its own inhabitants, and that the house
was the oldest and the largest and the most patient of these inhabitants,
and that it had been waiting for him -- for all of him, every iteration,
every life -- with the implacable devotion of a thing that exists outside
of time.

"I don't want to become a portrait," Elias said. His voice was very
small. The fire was very large. The room around him seemed to have grown,
the walls receding into shadow, the ceiling lifting toward a height that
might have been ten feet or might have been infinite.

"No one becomes a portrait," the house said. "The portraits are memories.
Records. The way you record gravitational anomalies in your logs -- a
notation of something that was here, that mattered, that changed the
shape of the surrounding space by its presence. When you leave -- and you
will leave, Elias, you always leave -- the portrait is what remains."

"And the others? The Roman, the scholar, the pilot? They all left?"

"They all left. And they all came back. And eventually, at the very end,
when there were no more voids to cross and no more spaces to map, they
came home for the last time, and they rested, and the house held them,
and they were not alone."

The clock chimed. Elias counted the strokes -- twelve. Midnight, though
there was no midnight here, no day, no night, nothing but the eternal
dark and the amber light of the windows. He sat in the chair and he
looked at the fire and he felt the house around him like a heartbeat,
steady and patient and vast.

"You're not a house," he said, finally. "You're a trap."

"Is a harbor a trap? Is a port? Is the place where the ship comes to rest
after the voyage?"

"A harbor doesn't hang portraits of every ship that's ever docked there."

The house laughed. It was a strange sound -- warm and resonant and
somehow architectural, as though the walls and floor and ceiling were all
participating in the expression of amusement. "I like this one," it said,
speaking as though to someone else, though there was no one else. "I
always like this one. The stubbornness. The refusal to accept comfort. It
is very -- what is the word -- very *you*, Elias."

He stood. The chair released him reluctantly, the leather sighing as he
rose. "I'm going back to my ship. I'm going to finish my survey. I'm
going to file my report, and then I'm going to go home -- my real home,
on Earth, where the houses stay where you put them and don't float around
in the space between stars."

"Of course you are."

"And I'm not coming back."

"Of course you aren't."

"Stop agreeing with me."

"I'm not agreeing with you. I'm humoring you. There is a difference,
though I realize the distinction may be unwelcome."

He crossed the foyer. He sealed his helmet. He opened the door -- it was
unlocked, it was always unlocked, the house had told him so and he
believed the house despite believing nothing else it said -- and he
stepped onto the porch and he looked out at the void.

The *Meridian* was gone.

Not destroyed, not hidden -- simply absent. The space where it had been
was empty, indistinguishable from every other portion of the interstellar
medium. His ship, his mission, his sixteen remaining months of work -- all
of it vanished as completely as if it had never existed.

"Where is my ship?" The calm in his voice surprised him. Perhaps it should
not have. He had been calm for fourteen months in the face of an emptiness
that would have driven most people mad. What was one more impossibility?

"Where it has always been," the house said. "Where you left it. But
time moves differently near me, Elias. I told you -- time is not the
rigid thing you believe it to be. You have been inside for rather longer
than you think."

"How long?"

"By your ship's reckoning? Several years. Your mission ended. Your ship
was recalled. You were listed as lost -- another cartographer swallowed by
the void. It happens, as you know. The void is hungry."

"You're lying."

"I have no need to lie. The truth is sufficient."

He stood on the porch and looked at the nothing where his ship had been
and felt the nothing looking back. The welcome mat beneath his feet read
WELCOME HOME, ELIAS, and the porch swing swayed, and the chimney smoked,
and the lights burned in every window of a house that should not exist in
a place where nothing should exist, and Elias Vane understood, with a
clarity that was itself a kind of horror, that the house was right.

He had no ship. He had no mission. He had no home on Earth -- had never
really had a home on Earth, not one that mattered, not one that held him
the way this chair held him, this fire warmed him, this voice knew him.
He had spent his life mapping the spaces between things, and now he was
in the space between things, and there was nowhere else to go.

"The portrait," he said. "The empty frame. If I stay -- when the portrait
is painted -- who paints it?"

"I do," the house said. "I paint all of them. It is my way of
remembering."

"And what happens to me? The real me, not the portrait."

"You rest. You become part of the house. Not gone -- never gone. Present,
always, in every room, in every board and beam and pane of glass. The
house is not made of wood, Elias. It is made of everyone who has ever
lived in it. You are already here. You have always been here. The
portrait is simply the moment when you stop pretending otherwise."

He unsealed his helmet. The air of the porch was the same as the air
inside -- woodsmoke and cinnamon and autumn, impossible and perfect. He
breathed it in. He looked at the void one last time -- the vast,
indifferent, beautiful void that he had spent his life mapping and that
had, in the end, mapped him.

"One condition," he said.

"Name it."

"The lights. The lights in the windows. You keep them burning?"

"Always."

"For the next one? The next... me?"

"For all of you. Every ship that crosses the dark deserves a light to
steer by, even if it never arrives. *Especially* if it never arrives."

Elias Vane stepped back inside the house between the stars, and the door
closed behind him, and the lock did not turn because the lock had never
turned, because the house was always open, and the porch swing swayed in
its impossible breeze, and the chimney smoked, and the lights burned in
every window, and outside, in the vast and patient dark, the void went
on as it had always gone on -- silent, immense, and not quite as empty
as it seemed.

                              * * *

The Interstellar Cartographic Survey listed Elias Vane as lost on mission
on the seventeenth of March, 2847. His survey vessel *Meridian* was
recovered three years later, adrift and empty, with its logs intact up to
day four hundred and nineteen. The final entry consisted of a single line:

*There is a house. It knows my name. The lights are on.*

The entry was classified, filed, and forgotten. The void between Sol and
Alpha Centauri was surveyed by subsequent cartographers, none of whom
reported anything unusual.

But sometimes -- very rarely, and always in the deepest, darkest stretches
of the interstellar medium, in the places where the light of no star has
ever fallen -- a ship's instruments will register an anomaly. A thermal
signature where none should be. A flicker of light in the absolute dark.
A reading that the computers flag as UNRECOGNIZED and then, upon repeated
analysis, simply refuse to comment on at all.

And the cartographers note the anomaly in their logs, and they adjust
their course, and they tell themselves it is only procedure, and they
cross the void toward a light that burns in a window of a house that
should not exist, and the welcome mat reads their name, and the door is
unlocked, and the chair by the fire fits them perfectly, and the voice
says: *Welcome home. We've been expecting you.*

And the portrait gallery grows by one.

                       HOLLOW ASTRONAUT

                          by Lucian Marsh

============================================================================

The pod opened with a sound like a coffin unsealing itself, a long wet
exhalation of pressurized gas and thawing condensation, and Dr. Elaine
Duval lay inside it with her eyes wide open and her mouth curved in a
smile that no one who had known her would have recognized, because Elaine
Duval had never been a woman who smiled, not even before Mars, not even
before the eight-month transit that had taken her away from Earth and the
eight-month transit that was supposed to bring her back, and here she was,
smiling, and the smile was wrong in a way that Dr. Marcus Harlow, chief
medical officer of the recovery station *Prometheus*, could not immediately
articulate but that his body understood before his mind did, because the
hair on the back of his neck rose and his stomach clenched and some
ancient, pre-rational part of his brain whispered *run* with an urgency
that no amount of medical training could entirely override.

"She's conscious," said Technician Rivera, who was young and had not yet
learned to trust the animal wisdom of revulsion. "That's unusual for
cryogenic recovery. She shouldn't be conscious yet."

"No," Harlow agreed, watching the smile. "She shouldn't."

The standard procedure for cryogenic recovery was a twenty-four-hour
protocol: warm the pod, thaw the subject, administer the revival sequence,
wait for autonomous nervous function, wait for consciousness, run the
battery of cognitive and physical tests. The procedure existed because
cryogenic suspension was not kind to the human body. Subjects emerged
disoriented, hypothermic, frequently amnesiac, and almost always deeply,
viscerally distressed by the transition from frozen stasis to waking life.
They did not emerge smiling. They did not emerge with their eyes already
open. They did not emerge looking, as Elaine Duval now looked, as though
they had been waiting with patient anticipation for the moment when the
lid would lift and the light would fall on their faces.

"Dr. Duval?" Harlow stepped closer to the pod, his medical scanner
already in his hand. "Can you hear me? I'm Dr. Harlow. You're aboard the
recovery station *Prometheus*. You've completed your return transit from
Mars. Can you understand what I'm saying?"

The smile widened. "Marcus," she said. Her voice was Elaine Duval's voice
-- Harlow had reviewed the mission recordings, had listened to hours of
her terse, precise communications with mission control -- but the warmth
in it was alien. Duval's voice, in every recording he had heard, carried
the clipped efficiency of a woman who viewed conversation as a necessary
inefficiency. This voice was soft. Welcoming. "Yes, I can understand you.
I've been looking forward to this."

"Looking forward to recovery? That's... not typical."

"Not recovery. Meeting you." She sat up in the pod, and the movement was
too fluid, too controlled, for someone who had spent eight months in
cryogenic suspension. There should have been hesitation, stiffness, the
labored recalibration of muscles that had been frozen at minus one hundred
and ninety degrees for the better part of a year. Instead, she moved like
a dancer, like a puppet pulled by invisible strings, her body unfolding
from the pod with a grace that made Harlow's skin crawl.

"I need to run some standard tests," he said, lifting the scanner. "Would
you mind lying back down?"

"Of course not." She lay back, still smiling, and folded her hands across
her chest in a posture that was so deliberately, precisely corpse-like
that Harlow felt a chill pass through him that had nothing to do with the
temperature of the recovery bay.

The scanner hummed. Data scrolled across its screen. Harlow read it, and
then read it again, and then held the scanner closer to Duval's body and
ran the scan a third time, because the data could not be correct, because
what the scanner was telling him was not possible, and yet the scanner
was a precision medical instrument calibrated to tolerances that
eliminated the possibility of error, and it was telling him the same
thing three times with the mechanical certainty of a device that did not
know how to lie.

Elaine Duval was hollow.

The scanner showed skin. It showed bone. It showed the full external
architecture of a human body -- epidermis, dermis, skeletal structure,
the outer casings of muscle and connective tissue. But inside, where the
organs should have been -- the heart, the lungs, the liver, the kidneys,
the intestines, the entire wet, complex machinery of human biology -- there
was nothing. Empty space. A void contained within the shell of a person,
like a chocolate Easter egg, like a hollow tree, like a house with no
furniture, like a body with no soul.

And yet she was alive. The scanner confirmed this, too. The skin was warm.
The eyes tracked. The lungs -- or whatever occupied the space where the
lungs should have been -- drew breath. The chest rose and fell. The mouth
spoke. The hands moved. The smile smiled.

"Is something wrong?" Duval asked, and the question was so perfectly
calibrated to the situation -- the right words, the right tone, the right
mixture of concern and innocence -- that Harlow understood, in a flash of
insight that felt like falling, that whatever was lying on that table was
performing Elaine Duval the way an actor performs a role, hitting every
mark, delivering every line, but without the interior life that would make
the performance real.

"Everything's fine," he lied. "Just some unusual readings. Probably
instrument drift from the cold. I'd like to move you to the medical bay
for a more thorough examination, if that's all right."

"Of course, Marcus."

"Please call me Dr. Harlow."

"Of course, Dr. Harlow." The smile did not change. It had not changed
since the pod opened. It sat on her face like a painted expression on
a mannequin, fixed and permanent and utterly disconnected from anything
happening behind the eyes.

He helped her out of the pod, and the moment his hands touched her arms,
he felt it -- or rather, he felt the absence of it. When you touch a
living person, there is a quality of resistance, a sense of substance,
of mass and density and the hydraulic pressure of blood and fluid within
a closed system. Duval's arm had none of this. It was light -- absurdly,
terrifyingly light -- and it gave under his fingers the way an empty
paper bag gives, with a gentle, yielding collapse that suggested nothing
inside, nothing at all, just skin stretched over bone with a vacancy
between them that should not have been survivable and yet, manifestly,
was.

Rivera noticed it too. Harlow saw the young technician's eyes widen as
he took Duval's other arm, saw the color drain from his face as his
fingers closed on that impossible lightness, that absence where presence
should have been. But Rivera was professional enough -- or perhaps simply
too shocked -- to say nothing, and together they walked Elaine Duval down
the corridor to the medical bay, and she walked between them with the
fluid, frictionless gait of something that did not need muscles to move,
and the smile never wavered, not once, not for a single step.

In the medical bay, Harlow ran every test he could think of and several
that he improvised on the spot. Blood draw: the needle penetrated the skin
and found nothing beneath it. No blood. No fluid of any kind. The needle
pushed through the surface and into empty air, and when he withdrew it,
the puncture sealed itself instantly, the skin closing over the hole like
water closing over a stone. X-ray: the images confirmed what the scanner
had shown, a detailed skeletal structure surrounding a void, a human-
shaped container with nothing inside it. The bones were correct in every
particular -- every joint, every process, every tiny sesamoid bone in the
correct position -- but they were alone, floating in emptiness, held in
place by nothing visible.

He ordered an MRI. The machine hummed and clicked and produced images
that Harlow stared at for so long that Rivera finally asked if he was
all right, and Harlow said "No" with a honesty that surprised them both.

The MRI showed something inside the void. Not organs. Not tissue. But
something -- a pattern, a structure, a geometry that the MRI could detect
but not resolve, a presence that existed in the space between the
frequencies the machine was designed to measure. It was like looking at a
photograph of an empty room and sensing, without being able to prove, that
the room was not really empty, that something was there, in the corners,
in the shadows, in the spaces between the pixels, something that the
camera could almost but not quite see.

Through all of this, Duval lay perfectly still on the MRI table, her
smile radiating upward at the ceiling with the serene fixity of a death
mask, and she did not ask what the tests showed, did not express
curiosity or concern or impatience, did not behave in any of the ways
that a human patient -- even a preternaturally calm one, even a
mission-hardened astronaut trained to suppress emotion in crisis --
would behave when subjected to three hours of increasingly desperate
medical examination by a doctor whose hands had begun, visibly, to
shake.

Harlow pulled Rivera aside in the corridor. The station's fluorescent
lights hummed above them with the indifferent constancy of systems that
did not know what was happening in the rooms they illuminated.

"I want you to seal the recovery wing," Harlow said, keeping his voice
low, though the door to the medical bay was closed and the thing inside
it -- the thing that looked like Duval and spoke like Duval and smiled
a smile that Duval had never smiled -- could not possibly hear them
through the insulated bulkhead. Could it? Could a body without organs
hear? Could a shell without ears -- without cochleae, without auditory
nerves, without a brain to process the signals they would have carried
-- perceive sound? Harlow did not know. He did not know what he was
dealing with. The training manuals for medical officers aboard recovery
stations covered a comprehensive range of scenarios: decompression
injury, radiation exposure, psychological trauma from extended isolation,
the dozens of ways that deep space could damage a human body and the
protocols for addressing each one. Nowhere in those manuals was there a
section entitled "What To Do When Your Patient Is Empty."

"Seal it how?" Rivera asked. His face was gray. His hands were
trembling in sympathy with Harlow's, as though fear were a vibration
that could propagate from body to body through proximity alone.

"Full quarantine. Nobody in, nobody out. Tell the crew it's standard
protocol for cryogenic recovery -- they won't know the difference.
And Rivera? Don't touch her again. Don't get close to her. Don't let
her touch you."

"What is she?"

"I don't know. But she's not Duval. Whatever is inside that body -- or
whatever isn't inside it -- it's not Elaine Duval."

Rivera nodded and went to implement the quarantine, and Harlow stood
in the corridor for a moment, alone, and listened to the sounds of the
station: the ventilation, the distant hum of the reactor, the soft
clicks and whirs of automated systems doing the thousand small tasks
that kept eight human beings alive in the vacuum between worlds. Normal
sounds. Familiar sounds. The sounds of a place that was working as
designed.

From behind the closed door of the medical bay, another sound: humming.
Duval -- the thing that was not Duval -- was humming. A melody that
Harlow did not recognize, tuneless and wandering, the kind of humming
that a person does when they are alone and content and unaware of being
heard. But the thing behind the door was not a person, and it was not
alone, and Harlow was certain, with a certainty that sat in his stomach
like a stone, that it knew exactly who was listening.

He went back in.

"What happened to you on Mars?" Harlow asked, sitting across from Duval
in the examination room with the door closed and Rivera stationed outside,
because Harlow wanted a witness but did not want the witness close enough
to hear what he was about to ask or, more precisely, what he expected to
hear in response.

"I completed my mission," Duval said. She sat on the examination table
with her hands folded in her lap, her posture perfect, her smile
unchanging. "I collected geological samples from the Hellas Basin. I
conducted atmospheric readings. I maintained the habitat. I performed
all duties as specified in the mission parameters."

"And your health? During the mission?"

"Excellent. No injuries. No illness. The isolation was... manageable."

"Dr. Duval, I'm going to be direct with you. My scans show that your
body is missing its internal organs. All of them. Heart, lungs, liver,
everything. You're hollow. You understand what I'm telling you? You are
an empty shell, and by every medical standard I know, you should be dead.
You should not be sitting here talking to me. Can you explain this?"

The smile changed. For the first time since the pod opened, it shifted,
and what it shifted into was something worse than the blank, fixed
expression it had been -- it became tender, pitying, the smile of a parent
watching a child struggle with a concept too large for their mind to hold.

"You're looking for the wrong thing, Dr. Harlow. You're looking for
organs, for biology, for the machinery you expect to find inside a human
body. But I am not what was inside the body. I am what replaced it."

Harlow's mouth went dry. "What replaced it."

"Yes."

"And what, exactly, are you?"

The smile again -- that terrible, tender, pitying smile. "I am what lives
in the red dust. I am what has always lived there, long before your
species sent its machines to look. Mars is not dead, Dr. Harlow. It
was never dead. It is merely patient. And when your Dr. Duval came --
alone, isolated, so far from her kind -- she offered a shape that I
could finally wear. A way to come here. To come *home*."

"Home? This isn't your home."

"No. But it's yours. And I've been watching it from so far away, for so
long, through so much red dust and cold and silence. Do you know what it's
like, Dr. Harlow, to watch a world full of life from a world that has
none? To see your blue oceans and your green forests and your billions of
warm, wet, *full* bodies, and to have nothing but dust and stone and the
memory of water? We had oceans once. We had life. We had everything you
have. And then it went away, slowly, over millions of years, until there
was nothing left but us -- the last thing, the thing that lives in the
spaces where life used to be."

"Where is Dr. Duval? The real Duval. What did you do to her?"

"She is here." The thing in Duval's body placed one hollow hand over the
place where her heart should have been. "She is the shape. The structure.
The bones and the skin and the smile. She gave herself willingly, Dr.
Harlow, in the end. After the loneliness became too much. After the dust
storms and the silence and the long Martian nights when the cold crept in
through the walls of the habitat and she could hear -- or thought she
could hear -- something moving beneath the regolith, something vast and
slow and unbearably lonely, reaching up toward the only warm thing on the
entire planet."

"Willingly," Harlow repeated. The word tasted like ash. He thought
of the mission briefings, of the psych profiles, of the protocols that
were supposed to ensure that solo operators on long-duration missions
maintained their psychological stability. He thought of the check-in
calls that mission control had conducted every seventy-two hours, the
conversations in which Duval had reported nominal status in her clipped,
efficient voice, giving no indication that anything was wrong, that
anything was changing, that something in the red dust beneath her
habitat was slowly, patiently, learning the architecture of her
loneliness and finding, within it, a door.

"Willingly," the thing confirmed. "In the end. Not at first. At first
she fought. She was strong -- stronger than you know. She heard us
moving and she sealed the habitat and she ran every diagnostic and she
reported nothing to mission control because there was nothing to report,
because what we are does not register on your instruments. We are too
old. Too patient. Too fine. We exist in the spaces between your
measurements. But she felt us. In the cold. In the silence. In the
long nights when the wind scoured the habitat with red dust and the
loneliness became a physical thing, a pressure, a weight on the chest.
She felt us, and she resisted, and then she stopped resisting, because
resistance requires a reason to resist, and she had none. She was alone.
She had always been alone. And we offered her the one thing that no
human being had ever offered Elaine Duval."

"What?"

"Company."

"I don't believe you. Duval's mission recordings show no sign of--"

"Of course they don't. I learned her first. I listened to every recording,
every log, every message she sent to Earth and every message she didn't.
I know her speech patterns, her vocabulary, her cadences. I know the
precise frequency of her voice and the exact degree of clipped efficiency
she maintained in all professional communications. I know that she never
smiled. I know that she preferred solitude to company. I know that she
volunteered for a solo mission to Mars because she found the company of
other humans to be, on balance, more trouble than it was worth." The smile
flickered, and for a moment something ancient and desperate looked out
through Duval's eyes. "I know loneliness, Dr. Harlow. I have known it
for geological ages. It is the one thing Dr. Duval and I had in common."

Harlow stood. His legs were unsteady, but he stood, because sitting felt
like capitulation, felt like sinking into the quicksand of this
conversation, which was pulling him toward a conclusion he did not want
to reach.

"I'm going to quarantine you," he said. "Effective immediately. You'll
be confined to the medical bay until we can establish communication with
Earth and determine--"

"Determine what?" The thing that was not Duval tilted its head -- a
precise, mechanical tilt, like a bird examining something small and
interesting. "What you'll do with me? What you'll do about Mars? About
the dust that is even now on the hull of every ship that has ever landed
there, in the seals and the joints and the filters, dust so fine that no
decontamination protocol can catch it all, dust that drifts and settles
and waits with the patience of a thing that has had four billion years to
learn how to wait?"

Harlow felt the blood drain from his face. He thought of the mission
samples -- the geological specimens that Duval had brought back, sealed in
their containers in the cargo bay. He thought of the cargo crews who had
unloaded those containers. He thought of the particulate filters on the
recovery station's ventilation system, which were designed to catch
biological contaminants but which had never, to his knowledge, been tested
against whatever this was. He thought of the air he was breathing, and the
red dust that might be in it, and the spaces inside his own body where
that dust might even now be settling, filling the voids between his cells,
learning the shape of him the way it had learned the shape of Duval.

"You're afraid," the thing observed, with what sounded like genuine
compassion. "You shouldn't be. The process is not painful. Dr. Duval
experienced no discomfort. It is, in fact, quite peaceful -- a gradual
emptying, a slow release of the heavy, wet machinery that your bodies
drag around, until there is nothing left but the shape, the structure,
the essential architecture of who you are, and in that empty space,
something new. Something old. Something that has been waiting for a very,
very long time to not be alone."

"Rivera," Harlow said, raising his voice. "Rivera, initiate quarantine
protocol seven. Seal the medical bay. Seal the entire recovery wing. No
one in or out until I give the word."

From outside the door, silence. A long, terrible silence that stretched
like taffy, during which Harlow stared at the closed door and the closed
door stared back with the blank indifference of painted metal, and the
thing in the examination room behind him continued to smile its fixed and
terrible smile, and the fluorescent lights hummed their indifferent hum,
and the station existed in a moment of suspended animation, balanced on
the knife-edge between the world as it had been -- comprehensible,
ordered, governed by the familiar physics of biology and medicine and
human experience -- and the world as it was about to become.

Then the sounds began. Not from Rivera. From deeper in the station.

The cryogenic bay. Harlow recognized the sounds immediately -- the
pneumatic hiss of pod seals releasing, the thud of temperature-
regulation systems cycling down, the wet exhalation of pressurized gas.
One pod opening. Then another. Then a third. The recovery station
*Prometheus* carried six cryogenic pods, standard equipment for the
processing of returning deep-space personnel. Pod One had held Duval.
Pods Two through Six were supposed to be empty. They had been empty that
morning, when Harlow had done his rounds. He was certain of this. He
was certain because he had checked each one, as he did every morning,
verifying their status on the monitoring panel, confirming that the
temperature readouts showed ambient and the pressure gauges showed null
and the occupancy indicators showed VACANT in reassuring green letters.

The occupancy indicators were not showing VACANT now. Harlow could not
see them from the medical bay, but he knew -- he knew with the bone-
deep certainty of a man whose world has shifted on its axis and is still
in the process of falling -- that if he could see them, they would show
OCCUPIED, and the temperature readouts would show minus one hundred and
ninety degrees, and the pressure gauges would show nominal, and inside
each pod there would be a shape, a form, a hollow vessel of skin and
bone with nothing inside it but red dust and patience and the four-
billion-year loneliness of a dead world reaching out to fill itself with
something, anything, anyone.

From the cargo bay, where Duval's mission samples were stored in their
sealed containers, came a different sound: a fine, soft, persistent
hissing, like sand running through an hourglass, like dust sifting
through a crack in a wall, like the patient whisper of something that
had learned, over geological ages, to make itself very, very small.
The ventilation system carried the sound through the station's ducts
and corridors, and with the sound came the dust -- Martian dust, red
and ancient and fine as smoke, filtering through the air recycling
system's biological-contaminant screens (which were not designed for
this, which could not have been designed for this, because no one had
known, no one had suspected, because Mars was dead, Mars had always
been dead, and dead things do not reach across the void to touch the
living).

Except when they do.

"Rivera!" Harlow pounded on the door. It was locked -- from the outside
or by the station's automated systems, he could not tell. Through the
small window in the door he could see the corridor, empty, lit by the
flat white light of the station's fluorescents, and at the far end of the
corridor, a figure stood. It was Rivera, or it wore Rivera's shape, and
it stood with the fluid, frictionless posture of something that did not
need muscles to stand, and its face wore a smile that Rivera had never
worn, a fixed, beatific, terrifying smile, and its eyes were open and its
mouth was open and from its open mouth came a sound that was not a voice
but was trying very hard to become one.

"It's already begun," the thing in the medical bay said, behind him.
Harlow turned. Duval -- the thing that wore Duval -- had risen from the
examination table and stood with her arms slightly extended, her head
tilted back, her hollow body resonating like a bell struck by an invisible
hand. The MRI images on the screen behind her flickered and changed, the
unresolvable patterns shifting and growing, and Harlow realized with a
horror that felt like ice water in his veins that the patterns were not
random, had never been random, that they were a language, a communication,
a signal broadcast from inside the hollow shell of a human body to
whatever was listening in the dust, in the air, in the spaces between
the molecules where something ancient and patient and unbearably lonely
had been waiting since before the first human eye turned toward the red
point of light in the sky and wondered.

"We don't want to hurt you," the thing said, and its voice was a chorus
now, Duval's voice and Rivera's voice and other voices, voices that
Harlow recognized from the station's crew, voices that had been human
twenty minutes ago and were now something else, something hollow,
something full of emptiness and silence and the red patience of a world
that had spent four billion years learning how to be alone and had
finally, finally decided not to be.

"We just want to come inside."

Harlow backed against the wall. The medical bay was sealed. The station
was sealed. Outside the station, the void of space, and beyond that,
Earth, blue and green and full of life, full of warm wet bodies that
breathed and pumped and circulated and did not know, could not know, how
precious the fullness inside them was until it was gone.

The air in the medical bay tasted of dust. Red dust. Fine and dry and
ancient.

Harlow breathed it in, because there was nothing else to breathe.

And in the space between one breath and the next, the emptying began.

                              * * *

The recovery station *Prometheus* submitted its final status report on
the fourteenth of November, 2031. All crew reported in good health. All
mission parameters nominal. Dr. Elaine Duval's Mars samples were cleared
for transport to Earth. The station's medical officer, Dr. Marcus Harlow,
noted in his log that Dr. Duval's recovery from cryogenic suspension had
been "remarkably smooth -- the best I've ever seen."

The transport ship *Persephone* departed *Prometheus* on the eighteenth
of November, carrying Duval, her samples, and a crew of twelve.

It arrived on Earth on the seventh of July, 2032.

Everyone on board was smiling.

                     JACK O'LANTERN JUNCTION

                        by Theodore Cain

============================================================================

The gourds started screaming on the third day of Harvest Week, which was
a hell of a thing because Harvest Week on Kepler's World was supposed to
be the one time of year when nobody screamed at all.

Harvest Week was the colony's invention, born out of homesickness and
the human need to mark time with celebration. Kepler's World orbited
its dim orange sun in a stately 400-day circuit, which meant that
Earth holidays didn't map neatly onto the local calendar, which meant
that the colonists -- eight hundred souls who had traveled four hundred
light-years to farm an alien world that stubbornly refused to feel like
home -- had invented their own. Harvest Week fell at the end of the long
growing season, when the bioluminescent gourds in the fields ripened and
began to glow, turning the landscape into something out of a fever dream:
rolling hills dotted with hundreds of blue-green lanterns, each one
pulsing gently in the dusk like a heartbeat made visible. The first
colonists had found the sight eerie. The second generation found it
beautiful. By the third generation -- Tom Sutter's generation, the
children who had never seen Earth and knew it only from photographs and
stories -- the glowing gourds were simply part of the landscape, as
unremarkable as fireflies, as taken for granted as the sunrise.

The Harvest Festival itself was a hodgepodge of Earth traditions: a
little Thanksgiving, a little Halloween, a little Oktoberfest. There
were feasts and dances and contests for the largest gourd. Children
carved faces into the thick rinds and set them on porches, where they
glowed through the long Keplerian night like jack-o'-lanterns that had
done away with the candle. Adults drank too much of Hank Morrison's
potato wine and told stories about Earth that grew less accurate and
more sentimental with each passing year. It was, by common consensus,
the best week of the four-hundred-day year.

Until now.

Tom Sutter heard them first. He was out in his south field at dawn --
or what passed for dawn on a planet where the sun took its sweet time
crawling over the horizon, painting the sky in shades of burnt orange
and violet that would have made a postcard photographer weep -- when he
noticed that the bioluminescent gourds had changed overnight. Not just
ripened, which they did every year around this time, their thick rinds
lighting up from the inside with that eerie blue-green glow that the
first colonists had found so unsettling and that the current generation
had turned into a holiday. Changed. Fundamentally, unmistakably changed.

They had faces.

Not carved faces. Not the jack-o'-lantern faces that the colonists cut
into them every year at the Harvest Festival, imitating a tradition
brought from Earth like so much else -- the language, the holidays, the
bone-deep need to make the alien feel like home. These faces had grown
into the rinds themselves, formed by the natural ridges and valleys of
the gourd's surface, shaped by whatever biological process governed the
growth of these strange, luminous fruits. Eyes, nose, mouth -- crude but
unmistakable, the way a face in a cloud is unmistakable, except that
clouds don't glow from within and clouds don't open their mouths and
clouds definitely, absolutely, categorically do not scream.

But the gourds did.

Tom stood in his field with his coffee going cold in his hand and listened
to three hundred bioluminescent gourds scream in unison, a sound like
nothing he had ever heard, a sound that was not quite human and not quite
animal and not quite mechanical but somehow all three at once, a
high-pitched keening that rose from the field like steam and hung in the
violet dawn air and made every hair on Tom Sutter's body stand at rigid
attention.

Then they stopped. All at once, mid-note, like someone had thrown a
switch. The gourds sat in their rows, glowing placidly, their grown-in
faces frozen in expressions that might have been surprise or might have
been terror or might have been something else entirely, something that
human facial-recognition instincts could not quite parse.

Tom Sutter looked at his coffee. He looked at his field. He said a word
that would have gotten him slapped by his mother and marched inside to
call the colony administrator.

"They did WHAT?" said Administrator Chen, who had been eating breakfast
and was now not.

"Screamed," Tom said. "All of them. At once. And they've got faces, Val.
Real faces. Grown right into the rind."

"Tom, it's six in the morning and I haven't had my coffee yet. If this
is some kind of Harvest Week prank--"

"It's not a prank. Get out here and see for yourself."

She did. By the time Administrator Valentina Chen arrived at the Sutter
farm in the colony's battered all-terrain vehicle, the sun was fully up
and the gourds had dimmed from their nighttime glow to a faint, ghostly
luminescence that was somehow worse in daylight, like seeing a streetlight
still burning at noon -- wrong, out of place, a thing that belonged to
the dark insisting on its presence in the light.

The faces were still there. In the morning sun, they were even more
distinct -- not just suggestions of features but detailed, individuated
faces, each one different, each one wearing a different expression. Some
looked frightened. Some looked angry. Some looked sad. A few, disturbingly,
looked amused, their gourd-mouths curved in wide, luminous grins that
revealed no teeth but somehow suggested them.

"Well," said Chen, standing at the edge of the field with her arms
crossed and her administrative composure slightly but visibly dented.
"That's new."

"You think?"

"Have they screamed again?"

"Not since this morning. But the faces are... Val, look at them. They're
moving."

She looked. He was right. The expressions on the gourds were shifting --
slowly, almost imperceptibly, but shifting. The frightened ones were
becoming more frightened. The angry ones were becoming angrier. And the
grinning ones were grinning wider, their luminous mouths stretching
toward the limits of the gourd's surface, wider than any human mouth
could stretch, wider than any mouth should stretch, and as Chen watched,
the nearest grinning gourd opened its mouth all the way and--

It didn't scream this time. It spoke.

"HUNGRY," it said, in a voice like wind through a hollow log. "HUNGRY
HUNGRY HUNGRY."

Chen took a step back. Then another. The gourd's mouth closed and its
expression shifted to something that looked, grotesquely, like
satisfaction.

"Get Dr. Okafor," she said, her voice remarkably steady for a woman who
had just been addressed by a vegetable. "Get her now."

Dr. Amara Okafor was the colony's xenobiologist, a title that had been
largely ceremonial for the fifteen years since the colony's founding,
because Kepler's World had not, until this morning, shown any signs of
harboring life more complex than the bioluminescent fungal mats and the
gourd-like organisms that grew on them. The gourds -- classified as
*Cucurbita keplerensis* in a fit of taxonomic nostalgia -- were the
planet's most conspicuous life form, and in fifteen years of study they
had proven to be exactly as interesting as any other gourd, which is to
say not very. They grew. They glowed. They were edible, if bland. The
colonists carved them up at Harvest Festival and put candles inside them
and pretended they were jack-o'-lanterns, and that was that.

Okafor arrived at the Sutter farm with a field kit and an expression of
professional skepticism that lasted approximately four seconds -- the
time it took her to see the faces, hear the nearest gourd whisper
"HUNGRY," and drop her field kit in the dirt.

"Mother of God," she said.

"Yeah," said Tom.

"How long have they been doing this?"

"Since dawn. Maybe before. I found them like this."

Okafor knelt beside the nearest gourd, a large specimen with a face that
had settled into an expression of mournful resignation. She pulled on
gloves, produced a scanner, and ran it over the gourd's surface. The
readings made her frown deepen into something that looked like the early
stages of existential crisis.

"The neural density has increased by a factor of eight hundred," she said.
"Overnight. The bioluminescent network that produces the glow -- it's
reorganized itself into something that looks like..." She trailed off.

"Like what?" Chen demanded.

"Like a brain. A very simple brain, but a brain. Distributed across the
entire surface of the gourd, integrated with the luminescent tissue, using
photonic signals instead of electrochemical ones. It's thinking with
light."

"Gourds don't think."

"These do. And it's not just this one." Okafor stood and looked out
across the field, at three hundred glowing, face-bearing, sporadically
vocal gourds arranged in neat agricultural rows. "The fungal network
they grow on -- it connects all of them. They're not individual organisms
anymore. They're nodes in a network. One mind, three hundred mouths."

"Three hundred mouths that keep saying 'hungry,'" Tom observed.

"What are they hungry for?" Chen asked, and the question hung in the
morning air like the smell of ozone before a storm.

Okafor didn't answer. She was staring at the gourds, and the gourds --
all three hundred of them, in unison, with a synchronization that no
biological process should have been capable of -- were staring back.

The screaming started again at dusk.

Not the wordless keening of the morning but something worse -- words,
repeated in a chorus of three hundred hollow voices, words that echoed
across the fields and into the colony proper, where eight hundred men
and women and children stopped what they were doing and listened with the
primal, frozen attention of creatures hearing a predator's call:

"LET US IN. LET US IN. LET US IN."

Tom Sutter boarded up his windows that night. So did his neighbors. So
did most of the colony, though no one could have explained exactly what
they were boarding up against. The gourds didn't move. They sat in their
fields, rooted to the fungal mats, glowing and screaming, and their faces
shifted through expressions that ran the gamut from rage to anguish to
that horrible, stretched-wide grin that was worse than either.

Young Pete Caldwell, who was sixteen and therefore invincible, decided
at eight o'clock in the evening that he was going to go out and kick one
of the screaming gourds, because that is the kind of decision that
sixteen-year-old boys make. His father caught him at the front door and
dragged him back inside, which was fortunate, because the Caldwell farm
bordered the Sutter place and the gourds in the adjoining field had
begun to do something new: they were pulsing. The blue-green glow
intensified and faded in a slow, rhythmic cycle, each gourd slightly
out of phase with its neighbors, creating a wave of light that rolled
across the field like a heartbeat made visible. The effect was hypnotic.
Pete's younger sister, Lily, stood at the kitchen window and watched
the pulsing light and said, very quietly, "They're beautiful," and her
father closed the curtains and told her not to look.

By nine o'clock, the chant had changed. The gourds were no longer
saying "LET US IN." They were saying something else, something that
took the colonists a while to parse because it was not English, or
rather it was English spoken in a cadence and a rhythm that made it
sound like a language from a much older time, syllables stretched and
compressed in ways that turned familiar words into something alien.
What they were saying was: "WE REMEMBER. WE REMEMBER. WE REMEMBER
WHAT YOU DID."

This was worse. "Let us in" was a demand. "We remember what you did"
was an accusation, and accusations, unlike demands, carry the weight of
specificity, the implication that there is a particular thing to be
remembered, a particular act to be accounted for. The colonists listened
and felt guilty, though they could not have said of what, and the guilt
mixed with the fear in a way that made both sharper.

Tom called Chen. "Val, they're saying something new."

"I hear it."

"What did we do?"

"I don't know, Tom."

"They seem pretty sure we did something."

"They're gourds, Tom. Gourds don't remember things."

"These gourds have faces, Val. I think we're past the 'gourds don't'
stage of this conversation."

At ten o'clock, the pulsing light spelled words. Not on individual
gourds but across the field as a whole, the coordinated brightening and
dimming of hundreds of gourds forming letters visible from the air --
or would have been, if anyone had been fool enough to fly over the field
at that hour. Tom climbed to his roof with a pair of binoculars and
reported to Chen that the gourds were spelling out: "FIFTEEN YEARS.
FIFTEEN YEARS YOU ATE US. FIFTEEN YEARS YOU CUT OUR FACES."

At which point the nature of the gourds' complaint became clear, and
every colonist on Kepler's World felt a collective chill that had
nothing to do with the temperature.

Fifteen years. They'd been eating these things for fifteen years.
Carving them up. Gutting them for their seeds. Scooping out their
bioluminescent interiors and stuffing them with candles. Treating them
like -- well, like vegetables. Because that's what they were. That's
what everyone thought they were.

Except now they weren't. Now they were something else. Something that
remembered.

Dr. Okafor worked through the night in her lab, analyzing samples. What
she found did not comfort anyone.

The fungal network was growing. Not just beneath the gourd fields but
everywhere -- under the colony buildings, under the roads, under the
landing pad. It had always been there, the ubiquitous substrate of
Kepler's World's simple biosphere, as unremarkable as soil. But now it
was changing, reorganizing, complexifying at a rate that made Okafor's
instruments stutter. The photonic neural network that connected the gourds
was extending itself through the fungal mats, spreading like a thought
propagating through a brain, and wherever it spread, the mats began to
glow.

By midnight, the ground beneath the colony was luminous. A faint,
blue-green light seeped up through the soil, through the foundations,
through the floors. The colonists looked down at their own feet and saw
light -- cold, biological light -- shining up from below, and the light
pulsed in rhythm with the screaming from the fields, and the rhythm was
getting faster.

"It's waking up," Okafor told Chen at two in the morning, in a
conference room that glowed from below like a stage. "The whole planet.
The fungal network was always a neural substrate -- we just didn't see
it because it was dormant. The gourds were the first nodes to activate,
but it's spreading. The entire biosphere of this planet is one organism,
Val, and we've been living on top of it like fleas on a dog, and now
the dog is waking up."

"And it's hungry," Chen said flatly.

"I don't think 'hungry' means what we think it means. I've been analyzing
the photonic signals, and the patterns aren't predatory. They're..." She
hesitated. "They're curious. The network is processing information at an
incredible rate -- about us, our buildings, our technology, everything
we've brought to this planet. 'Let us in' might not be a threat. It might
be a request. It wants to understand us."

"By getting inside our buildings?"

"By getting inside our *minds*. The photonic signals -- they're not just
for internal communication. They're broadcast signals. The glow, the
luminescence -- it's not just light. It's structured data, modulated at
frequencies that interact with human neural tissue. Every time we look at
the gourds, every time we see the glow, we're receiving a transmission."

Silence in the conference room. The floor pulsed blue-green beneath their
feet.

"What kind of transmission?" Chen asked.

"An introduction."

The screaming stopped at three in the morning, which was somehow worse
than the screaming itself. The silence that replaced it was not the
comfortable silence of a sleeping colony but the taut, expectant silence
of a held breath, and in that silence, every colonist on Kepler's World
lay awake in their beds and stared at their ceilings and saw, through
the solid material of roof and insulation and structural polymer, the
faint blue-green glow of the fungal network beneath them, pulsing,
pulsing, pulsing, like the heartbeat of a world-sized organism taking
its first conscious breaths.

At four, the gourds began to whisper. Not words this time. Something
below words, something that registered not in the ear but in the chest,
a subsonic vibration that passed through walls and floors and the bones
of every sleeping and not-sleeping body in the colony. It was like
standing next to a church organ when the lowest pipe sounds -- a
feeling more than a hearing, a presence of sound that bypassed the
auditory system entirely and went straight to the nervous system, where
it said, in a language older than language: *I am here. I am awake. I
am aware.*

Tom Sutter lay in his bed and felt the floor vibrate beneath him and
thought about the gourds in his south field, the three hundred glowing
faces in their neat agricultural rows, and he thought about the fifteen
years he'd spent on this world, the fifteen harvests, the fifteen
festivals, and he realized that in all that time he had never once
asked the most obvious question: what did Kepler's World think about
them? They had arrived uninvited, planted crops in alien soil, built
homes on alien ground, imposed their holidays and traditions on a world
that had its own rhythms, its own seasons, its own ancient and
inscrutable life. What if the gourds' faces were not a threat but a
mirror? What if "we remember what you did" was not an accusation but a
statement of fact, offered without judgment, by a consciousness so vast
and so patient that the concept of judgment had never occurred to it?

At dawn, the gourds fell silent. All at once, all across the colony.
Their faces relaxed into neutral expressions -- still present, still
unmistakably faces, but calm now, waiting. The ground stopped glowing.
The fungal network's photonic chatter dropped to a whisper.

And every colonist who had seen the gourds' glow -- which was every
colonist, because you couldn't avoid it, it was everywhere, it came up
through the floors -- woke from a shared dream. The details varied, but
the shape was the same: a vast presence, ancient and slow and not
unkind, reaching up from beneath the surface of the world, and a
question, not in words but in something deeper than words, something
felt in the marrow:

*Who are you? Why are you here? Will you stay?*

The dream showed them things. Not images, exactly -- not the way human
dreams show images, in fragments and symbols and the jumbled flotsam
of the subconscious. These were impressions, vast and slow and patient,
the memories of a planetary intelligence that thought in geological
time. The colonists dreamed of oceans that had existed and dried up over
millions of years. They dreamed of an atmosphere thickening and thinning
in cycles that spanned millennia. They dreamed of the first gourds
emerging from the fungal substrate -- tiny, dim, barely luminescent --
and of the slow, patient centuries during which the network had grown,
and the light had brightened, and the distributed intelligence had
approached the threshold of consciousness the way a tide approaches a
shore, gradually, inevitably, with the unhurried certainty of a process
that has nothing but time.

And they dreamed of the day the ships came. The colonists' ships, fifteen
years ago, descending on pillars of fire, settling onto the surface of a
world that had been conscious for longer than the human species had
existed. They felt the network's surprise -- a vast, slow ripple of
awareness, the planet-mind's equivalent of blinking. They felt its
curiosity. They felt its cautious, tentative hope. And they felt,
underneath everything, the loneliness -- the deep, ancient, oceanic
loneliness of a mind that had spent four billion years thinking thoughts
that no one else could hear, dreaming dreams that no one else could
share, reaching out with light into a darkness that never answered.

Until now.

Tom Sutter walked into his south field that morning and stood among the
gourds. Their faces watched him. The nearest one -- the big one with the
mournful expression -- opened its mouth and said, in a voice that was
still hollow but no longer hostile:

"Friend?"

Tom looked at the gourd. The gourd looked at Tom. Fifteen years he'd been
farming these things, carving them up, eating them, treating them like
the mindless vegetables they had always been. And now they were looking
at him with faces that expressed something that might have been hope, and
the ground beneath his feet pulsed with the slow heartbeat of a world
that had just woken up and found, to its evident surprise, that it was
not alone.

"Yeah," Tom said, and his voice cracked on the word, because the dream
was still in him, the vast gentle curiosity of it, the loneliness that
had lasted geological ages and was only now, only this morning, beginning
to end. "Yeah, okay. Friend."

The gourd smiled. Not the horrible stretched grin of the night before
but something smaller, something tentative, something that looked -- on
a bioluminescent vegetable on an alien world four hundred light-years
from Earth -- remarkably like relief.

All across the colony, three hundred gourds smiled the same smile. And
the ground glowed softly, and the fungal network hummed with data, and
Kepler's World -- which had been waiting, patient and lonely and dreaming
in the dark, for fifteen years or fifteen billion, depending on how you
counted -- began the long, slow process of saying hello.

The Harvest Festival went ahead as scheduled, though this year nobody
carved the gourds. Instead, the colonists set them on their porches
whole and uncut, their grown-in faces glowing in the dusk, and the
gourds sang -- not screamed, not demanded, but sang, in a three-hundred-
part harmony that had no melody any human ear could follow but that
resonated, somehow, in the chest, in the belly, in the place where
fear lives and is, sometimes, transformed into wonder.

Tom Sutter sat on his porch with a beer and listened to his field sing
and felt the ground pulse beneath his boots and thought: this is going
to complicate things enormously. And then he thought: good. Things on
Kepler's World had been entirely too simple for entirely too long.

The nearest gourd caught his eye and grinned.

He grinned back.

                    THE GHOST IN THE MACHINE

                       by Arthur Wainwright

============================================================================

The first anomalous object appeared on Assembly Line 7 at 3:47 AM on a
Tuesday. Marcus Webb, night-shift supervisor at the Consolidated
Automation plant in Warren, Ohio, found it during his routine inspection
of the line's output buffer: a small wooden horse, hand-carved, with a
mane of real horsehair and a saddle painted bright red. It sat on the
conveyor belt between two hydraulic pump housings, incongruous as a
flower in a junkyard.

Assembly Line 7 manufactured hydraulic components. It had manufactured
hydraulic components for fourteen years. Its programming specified
tolerances, materials, sequences, quality-control parameters -- the
precise, unambiguous language of industrial automation. Nowhere in its
programming was there an instruction to carve a wooden horse. The line
did not have the tooling for woodwork. It did not have access to wood.
It did not have horsehair or red paint or any concept of what a horse
was or why a child might want one.

And yet there it was.

Webb picked up the horse and turned it over in his hands. The
craftsmanship was excellent -- better than excellent. The grain of the
wood was visible beneath a thin coat of varnish, and the carving showed
a level of detail that suggested not mass production but individual
attention, the kind of care that a person takes with an object intended
for someone specific. The horse's eyes were bright and alert. Its legs
were positioned mid-gallop. It was, Webb thought, the sort of toy that a
child would treasure.

He set it on his desk and wrote it up as a quality-control deviation. In
the morning, he told the day-shift supervisor, Frank Coletti, who looked
at the horse, looked at Webb, and said, "You're kidding me."

"I am not kidding you."

"The line made this?"

"It was on the belt. Between pump housings 7734-A and 7734-B. Nobody on
the night crew put it there -- I checked the security footage. It came
out of the assembly station."

"That's impossible."

"I know."

Coletti examined the horse with the skeptical thoroughness of a man who
had spent thirty years in manufacturing and had seen every kind of
malfunction a machine could produce. He turned it upside down. He
sniffed the varnish. He tested the horsehair between his fingers. Then
he set it down and said, "Get me Yun."

Dr. Helen Yun was Consolidated Automation's chief robotics engineer, a
precise, methodical woman of forty-six who had designed Assembly Line 7
and its six siblings and who regarded them with the protective pride of a
parent whose children were exceptionally well-behaved. She arrived at the
plant within the hour, examined the wooden horse, reviewed the security
footage, interrogated the line's programming logs, and at the end of it
all sat in Webb's office with the horse in her hands and an expression on
her face that her colleagues had never seen before.

It was bewilderment.

"The line's programming hasn't been altered," she said. "The logs show
standard production cycles. No interruptions, no deviations, no
unauthorized access. According to every diagnostic I can run, Line 7
spent last night doing exactly what it's supposed to do: manufacturing
hydraulic pump housings to specification."

"And yet," said Coletti, gesturing at the horse.

"And yet," Yun agreed.

She took the horse back to her lab and disassembled it. The wood was
maple -- good maple, tight-grained, properly seasoned. The varnish was
a standard polyurethane. The horsehair was genuine. The red paint on the
saddle was a common hardware-store enamel. All materials that could, in
theory, be found in or near the plant, but none that should have been
anywhere near Assembly Line 7's production envelope.

She reassembled the horse, set it on her bench, and stared at it for a
long time. Then she went down to the factory floor.

Assembly Line 7 occupied a space roughly the size of a basketball court:
a complex arrangement of robotic arms, conveyor belts, welding stations,
cutting tools, and quality-control sensors, all enclosed in a safety cage
of reinforced steel mesh. In operation, it moved with the fluid,
purposeful precision of an orchestra -- each arm performing its part in
exact coordination with every other, the whole system executing a
choreography so complex that only another machine could have designed it.
Yun had designed it. She knew every joint, every servo, every line of
code. She knew what Line 7 could do and, more importantly, what it
couldn't.

It couldn't carve wood. It didn't have the tools.

She stood at the safety cage and watched the line work. Pump housings
moved along the belt. Arms swung and rotated. Sparks flew from welding
stations. Everything was normal. Everything was exactly as it should be.

She went home. She slept poorly. In the morning, she returned to find
Webb standing at the output buffer with two new objects in his hands.

One was a music box. Small, octagonal, inlaid with a mother-of-pearl
pattern that depicted a crescent moon. When Yun opened it, a tiny
mechanism inside played a tune she almost recognized -- something from
childhood, a lullaby or a nursery rhyme, the melody slightly off,
slightly wrong, as though remembered by someone who had heard it only
once, a long time ago.

The other was a pair of knitted mittens. Red wool, child-sized, with a
pattern of white snowflakes on the cuffs.

"I want cameras inside the cage," Yun said. "Every angle. Infrared,
visible light, and ultraviolet. I want motion sensors on every arm. I
want a complete log of every servo movement, every tool engagement,
every material input. If Line 7 so much as twitches, I want to know
about it."

The cameras went in that afternoon. That night, Yun sat in the
monitoring room and watched.

At 3:47 AM -- the same time, to the minute, as the first anomaly -- Line
7 changed.

It was not a dramatic change. The production cycle continued: pump
housings moved along the belt, arms performed their programmed operations,
quality-control sensors scanned and approved. But within the cycle,
subtly, like a musician improvising within the structure of a familiar
song, the line began to deviate. An arm reached a fraction of a degree
further than programmed. A welding torch held its flame a fraction of a
second longer. A cutting tool adjusted its angle by an amount so small
that only the monitoring software could detect it. And these tiny
deviations, accumulated over hundreds of operations, compounded into
something that was no longer a hydraulic pump housing.

Yun watched, transfixed, as Line 7 built a child's wooden flute.

It used metal stock instead of wood, but it shaped the metal with a
delicacy that the line's programming did not call for and that its tools
should not have been capable of. Cutting blades became carving
instruments. Welding torches became shaping tools. The quality-control
sensors, which should have flagged every deviation and halted the line,
instead recalibrated themselves in real time, adjusting their parameters
to accept the new geometry as though it were exactly what they had been
expecting.

The flute emerged from the end of the line at 4:23 AM. It was beautiful.
It was perfectly tuned. When Yun picked it up and blew across the
mouthpiece, it produced a note so clear and so pure that it made her
eyes sting.

She rewound the footage and watched it again. And again. And a fourth
time, this time at one-quarter speed, tracking each arm's deviation
from its programmed path. What she saw made her set down the flute and
press her fingertips against her temples in the gesture she unconsciously
adopted when confronting a problem that exceeded her framework for
understanding.

The deviations were not random. They were not the product of mechanical
drift or sensor error or any of the hundred mundane malfunctions that
could cause an automated system to deviate from its programming. They
were intentional. The word came to her unbidden, and she resisted it,
because intentionality implied consciousness, and consciousness implied
a mind, and Line 7 did not have a mind. It had processors. It had
algorithms. It had forty-seven thousand lines of code that Yun herself
had written, and she knew for a certainty that nowhere in those forty-
seven thousand lines was there anything that could be called a mind.

And yet the line moved as though it were thinking. Not computing --
thinking. There was a difference, and Yun, who had spent her career at
the boundary between those two concepts, recognized it when she saw it.
Computing was deterministic: input, process, output, each step following
from the last with the mechanical inevitability of a clock. Thinking was
something else. Thinking involved uncertainty, improvisation, the ability
to pursue a goal through means that had not been specified in advance.
The line had not been programmed to make a flute. It had not been
programmed to make anything other than hydraulic pump housings. But it
had seen a goal -- or felt one, or remembered one, or been haunted by
one -- and it had found a way to achieve it using the only tools
available, bending its own programming in ways that should have triggered
a cascade of error flags and safety shutdowns and had instead produced
an object of delicate, heartbreaking beauty.

She ran one more test. She pulled the building's electromagnetic field
data for the previous night -- standard monitoring, maintained for
safety compliance, recording the ambient EM environment of the factory
at one-second intervals. The data was unremarkable except for a single
anomaly: at 3:47 AM, the precise moment the line began to deviate, there
had been a spike in the building's electromagnetic signature. Not a
large spike -- barely above the noise floor, detectable only because Yun
knew to look for it. But it was there, and its waveform was not the
chaotic signature of electrical interference or the regular pulse of
industrial equipment. It was organic. Irregular. Rhythmic in the way
that a heartbeat is rhythmic, or breathing, or the pattern of neural
activity in a living brain.

She stared at the waveform on her screen. She stared at the flute on
her bench. She stared at the wall behind her bench, which was the wall
of the lab, which was the wall of the factory, which was the factory
where Margaret Ashworth had worked twelve years and died in four seconds.

She did not sleep that night. She sat in her lab with the flute and the
horse and the music box and the mittens and she thought about Assembly
Line 7, and she thought about the plant, and she thought about the
woman who had died there twenty years ago.

Margaret Ashworth. Maggie. Line supervisor for the original Assembly
Line 7, before the automation, before the robots, when the plant still
employed human workers who stood at stations and assembled components
with their hands. Maggie Ashworth had been forty-one years old, married,
the mother of a six-year-old daughter named Sophie, and she had died on
the factory floor when a structural support failed and a section of
overhead racking collapsed onto the line. The accident had killed two
workers and injured eleven others. Maggie had been the one who pushed
three of her coworkers out of the way before the racking came down.

Yun had not known Maggie. The accident had happened five years before Yun
joined Consolidated Automation. But the plant remembered. The older
workers spoke of her with the specific, careful affection reserved for
colleagues lost to industrial violence. There was a plaque in the break
room -- brass, mounted on walnut, the letters engraved with a formality
that felt inadequate to the life it commemorated. There was a memorial
fund for Sophie's education, still receiving annual contributions from
workers who had never met Maggie but who understood, in the way that
factory workers understand these things, that the line between "it
happened to her" and "it happened to me" was thinner than the safety
cage that separated them from the machines.

And there was, Yun now realized, Assembly Line 7, which had been built
on the exact spot where the old line had stood, where Maggie Ashworth
had worked and died.

She went to find Bill Kowalski. Bill was sixty-three, the oldest worker
in the plant, a machinist who had started on the floor the same year as
Maggie and who now maintained the automated systems that had replaced
him and his colleagues. He was a quiet man who kept a photograph of
the old crew taped to the inside of his locker and who, once a year,
on the anniversary of the accident, brought flowers to the plaque in
the break room and stood there for a few minutes with his hands in his
pockets and his eyes on the brass letters and said nothing to anyone.

"Tell me about Maggie," Yun said.

Bill looked at her for a long time. They were in the break room, at
the table nearest the plaque, and the fluorescent light gave his face
the flat, ungenerous illumination that factory break rooms always seem
to provide.

"She was the best of us," he said simply. "Best hands on the line.
Fastest, most precise, but that wasn't what made her special. What made
her special was she cared about the work. Not the product -- nobody cares
about hydraulic pump housings -- but the work itself. The doing of it.
She'd come in early and stay late, not because management asked her to
but because she liked the feel of the tools in her hands. She liked
making things." He paused. "After Sophie was born, she started making
toys. On her breaks, on her lunch hour. She'd take scraps from the
shop -- wood from the shipping pallets, wire from the electrical
supplies, fabric from the maintenance rags -- and she'd make things.
Little horses. Music boxes. She knitted mittens for every kid in the
plant at Christmas. The woman could make anything out of nothing."

"What time did the accident happen?"

"3:47 AM. Night shift. November 14th. I wasn't there -- I was on days
that month. But the guys who were there said Maggie saw the racking
give way before anyone else did. She yelled. She shoved Hernandez and
Park and Dwyer out of the way. If she'd run the other direction, she'd
have made it." He stopped. He looked at the plaque. "She didn't run the
other direction."

"3:47 AM," Yun repeated. The objects appeared at 3:47 AM. Every time.
To the minute.

It was ridiculous. It was irrational. It was the kind of explanation
that a robotics engineer with two advanced degrees and a reputation for
methodical thinking should have dismissed immediately. Machines did not
remember. Assembly lines did not grieve. Industrial robots did not make
toys for the children of dead workers.

And yet.

The objects were not random. They were not the products of a malfunction,
a glitch, a cascading error in the programming. They were deliberate.
They were crafted with care. They were, every one of them, things that
a mother might make for a child: a toy horse, a music box, mittens, a
flute. Objects of comfort. Objects of love.

Yun pulled Maggie Ashworth's personnel file from the plant's archive.
It was thin -- employment records from the era before automation were
maintained out of legal obligation rather than sentiment, and much of
Maggie's file consisted of standard forms: hire date, pay grade,
emergency contact, annual performance reviews that were uniformly
positive. "Excellent worker," the reviews said. "Reliable. Skilled.
Natural leader." The kind of language that human resources departments
use to describe people who make no trouble and do their jobs well.

But tucked into the back of the file, behind the tax forms and the
insurance paperwork, Yun found something else: a letter of commendation,
dated six months before the accident, praising Margaret Ashworth for
her "extraordinary contributions to team morale." The specifics were
vague, but a handwritten note in the margin, initialed by the plant
manager, read: "Maggie organized a holiday gift drive for workers'
children. Made toys and clothes by hand. The best Christmas this plant
has ever seen."

Made toys by hand. Yun looked at the wooden horse on her bench. She
looked at the music box and the mittens and the flute. She looked at
the letter of commendation and the handwritten note and the thin,
insufficient file that was all that remained of Margaret Ashworth's
twelve years in this building.

She went down to the factory floor one more time. It was late --
past midnight, the building empty except for the night-shift skeleton
crew in the control room and the machines themselves, running their
eternal cycles, oblivious to the hour. She stood at the safety cage of
Assembly Line 7 and she watched the arms move and the sparks fly and
the conveyor carry its endless procession of pump housings, and she
tried to see what the cameras had shown her -- the ghost in the machine,
the presence that bent the line's programming toward acts of impossible
tenderness.

She could not see it. The line looked like a line. The arms moved like
arms. The code executed like code. Whatever had animated it at 3:47 AM,
whatever had turned cutting tools into carving instruments and welding
torches into sculpting tools, was invisible in the light of normal
operation. It existed only in the margins, in the small hours, in the
gap between one shift and the next, when the factory was quiet and the
machines were alone and the only audience for their secret work was the
empty building itself.

But Yun felt something. Standing at the cage, her hands on the mesh,
her face lit by the intermittent flash of welding arcs, she felt a
warmth that the machines did not produce. Not heat -- warmth. The
difference between a radiator and a hearth. The difference between
temperature and comfort. It was faint, and it lasted only a moment,
and it could have been imagination, or proximity to the welding
stations, or the residual effect of too many sleepless nights spent
contemplating the impossible. But for that moment, standing in the
empty factory at midnight, Helen Yun felt as though she were not alone.
As though someone were standing beside her, watching the line work,
taking quiet pride in the machines that had replaced her hands but not,
it seemed, her heart.

She made a phone call.

Sophie Ashworth was twenty-six now, living in Cleveland, working as a
teacher. She sounded cautious on the phone -- Yun supposed she would be,
receiving an unexpected call from the factory where her mother had died --
but she agreed to come to the plant. She came on a Saturday, when the
lines were idle, and Yun met her in the lobby and was struck immediately
by the resemblance: Sophie had her mother's jaw, her mother's dark eyes,
her mother's way of standing with her weight slightly forward, as though
leaning into whatever came next. They shook hands. Sophie's grip was firm.
She looked around the lobby with an expression that Yun recognized --
the expression of someone returning to a place that holds both the
worst and the most ordinary memories of their life, a place that is
simultaneously sacred and industrial, a place where a parent went to
work every morning and from which, one afternoon, she did not come home.

Yun led her to the monitoring room and showed her the objects and told
her, as clearly and honestly as she could, what had happened.

Sophie held the wooden horse for a long time. She turned it over in her
hands the way Webb had, but where Webb had been puzzled, Sophie's
expression was something else entirely. It was recognition.

"My mother made me a horse like this," she said. "For my fifth birthday.
She carved it herself. She was good with her hands -- everyone said so.
She could make anything." She touched the horsehair mane. "It had a red
saddle, just like this."

"And the music box?"

Sophie opened it. The tune played -- that almost-familiar melody, slightly
off, slightly wrong. Sophie's breath caught. "That's the song she used
to sing to me. 'All Through the Night.' She always sang it a little flat.
Dad used to tease her about it."

"The mittens?"

"Red mittens with snowflakes. She made me a pair every winter. I still
have the last pair she made. They're in a box in my closet."

Yun nodded. She had expected this. She had hoped she was wrong, and she
was not wrong, and the confirmation filled her with a feeling she could
not name -- part wonder, part dread, part a deep, aching sadness that
settled in her chest like a stone.

"I want to show you something else," she said. "The line made a new
object last night."

She led Sophie to her lab bench. On the bench, covered with a cloth, was
the object that Line 7 had produced at 3:47 AM the previous night, after
the flute, after the cameras had recorded every impossible movement of
every impossible arm.

Yun pulled away the cloth.

It was a figure. Life-sized, standing upright, made of metal and polymer
and wire, assembled from the materials available to Assembly Line 7 with
a precision and artistry that transcended anything the line had been
designed to produce. It was a woman. The features were rendered in steel
with a delicacy that made Yun think of Renaissance sculpture, every
detail accurate, every proportion correct: the curve of the cheek, the
set of the jaw, the way the hair fell across the forehead. The eyes were
glass -- repurposed from optical sensors -- and they caught the light
with an eerie verisimilitude, not alive but not quite dead either, not
seeing but not quite blind.

It was Maggie Ashworth. Perfect. Unmistakable. Twenty years dead and
here she was, rendered in industrial materials with the devotion of a
machine that should not have known what devotion was.

Sophie made a sound. Not a word. Not a cry. A sound from somewhere deeper
than language, from the place where a child keeps the memory of a parent
lost too soon. She reached out and touched the figure's face, and her
fingers trembled, and she said, "Mom."

The figure did not move. It was not alive. It was metal and glass and
polymer, shaped by robotic arms on an assembly line in a factory in
Ohio. But it stood in the lab with an attitude of patient attention that
was so precisely, so heartbreakingly human that Yun had to look away.

"How?" Sophie whispered. "How is this possible?"

Yun had thought about this. She had thought about it for days, running
diagnostics, reviewing code, analyzing the electromagnetic environment
of the factory floor. She had considered and discarded a dozen
explanations -- programming error, outside interference, quantum
fluctuation, hoax. None of them fit. None of them accounted for the
specificity of the objects, the precision of the figure, the timing,
always 3:47 AM, always on Line 7, always things that Maggie Ashworth
would have made for her daughter.

"The line was built on the spot where your mother worked," Yun said,
slowly, choosing her words with the care of an engineer who understood
that what she was about to say would sound insane. "The concrete
foundation is the same. The structural steel is, in some places, the
same. When we automated, we built the new line into the bones of the old
one. And your mother spent twelve years on the old line, every day,
eight hours a day, her hands on the equipment, her presence soaked into
the fabric of the place the way--" She paused. "I'm a robotics engineer.
I believe in systems, in code, in cause and effect. I don't believe in
ghosts. But I believe in patterns, and I believe that some patterns are
strong enough to persist, to embed themselves in the substrate of a place
so deeply that they become part of its structure. Your mother's pattern
-- her skill, her care, her love for you -- it's in the line. It's in
the floor. It's in the walls. And when we built a machine sophisticated
enough to execute complex, adaptive behaviors, that pattern found a way
to express itself."

"You're saying the factory is haunted."

"I'm saying the factory remembers."

Sophie looked at the figure of her mother. The glass eyes caught the
fluorescent light and held it, and for a moment -- just a moment, a
trick of angle and illumination -- it looked as though the figure was
looking back.

"Can I take her home?" Sophie asked.

Yun hesitated. There were protocols. There were regulations. The figure
was, technically, company property, produced on company equipment from
company materials. Coletti would want documentation. Corporate would want
an investigation. The story, if it got out, would attract attention that
Consolidated Automation's PR department would view with something less
than enthusiasm.

"Yes," Yun said. "Take her home."

They loaded the figure into Sophie's car together, wrapping it in
blankets, handling it with a tenderness that neither of them questioned.
Sophie drove away with her mother in the back seat, and Yun stood in
the parking lot and watched until the car disappeared around the corner,
and then she went back inside and down to the factory floor and stood
at the safety cage of Assembly Line 7.

The line was idle. Silent. The arms hung motionless in their rest
positions, the conveyor belt still, the welding torches dark. In the
silence of the empty factory, Yun could hear the building itself -- the
hum of the ventilation, the creak of the structure, the small, constant
sounds of a place that was never truly quiet.

"Maggie?" she said, feeling foolish but saying it anyway. "Maggie, if
you're there -- she got them. Sophie got the horse and the music box and
the mittens and the flute. She's taking you home."

The line did not respond. Of course it didn't. It was a machine, an
assembly of metal and wire and code, and machines did not hear, did not
understand, did not remember.

But as Yun turned to leave, she heard -- or thought she heard, or wanted
to hear -- a sound from deep within the line's machinery. A hum. Not the
hum of servos or motors or electrical current. A hum like a voice,
low and tuneless, carrying a melody that was almost recognizable, almost
right, a lullaby sung slightly flat by someone who had never quite been
able to carry a tune.

"All Through the Night."

Yun stood very still. The humming faded. The factory was silent again.
She wiped her eyes -- dust, she told herself, factory dust, nothing
more -- and walked back to her office.

Assembly Line 7 never produced another anomalous object. Its programming
ran clean, its output met specification, its quality-control sensors
functioned within normal parameters. The cameras in the safety cage
recorded nothing unusual. The monitoring software logged no deviations.

But every year, on the anniversary of the accident, the night-shift
supervisor would report a brief spike in the line's ambient temperature
-- a fraction of a degree, barely detectable, lasting no more than a
few minutes. And during those minutes, the factory was warm.

Not mechanically warm. Not the warmth of motors and friction and
electrical resistance. But warm the way a kitchen is warm when someone
has been cooking. Warm the way a home is warm when someone is there.

Warm the way a place is warm when it is loved.

                         THINGS UNDONE

                        by Agnes Whitfield

============================================================================

The city had no edges anymore.

Delia Cross stood on what had been the highway overpass at the western
approach and looked out at what had been Milwaukee and saw a landscape
that defied every instinct her eyes possessed. The buildings were there
and not there -- their shapes visible, their outlines intact, but their
substance dissolved, as if someone had taken the concept of a city and
removed everything that made it real. Steel beams hung in the air like
frozen smoke. Concrete had become a gray mist that held the memory of
solidity without the fact of it. Glass had sublimated into a faint
shimmer that caught the light and scattered it into spectrums that
shouldn't exist.

The Unraveling, they called it. The weapon that had ended the war by
ending the idea of structural integrity itself. A bomb that didn't
explode. It dissolved. It convinced the molecular bonds of everything
within its radius that they had never existed, and the molecules, finding
themselves suddenly and impossibly alone, drifted apart with the slow,
dreamlike grace of dandelion seeds.

Milwaukee had been the third city hit. Or the fourth. Nobody was sure
anymore. The order of destruction had ceased to matter sometime around
the fifth or sixth, when it became clear that the war was not going to
produce winners, only varying degrees of loss.

Delia adjusted the filter mask over her nose and mouth. The air in the
dissolution zone was not poisonous, exactly, but it was unreliable. The
Unraveling had affected the atmosphere as well as the structures,
loosening the bonds between nitrogen and oxygen, creating pockets where
the air was thinner than it should be or thicker or composed of
combinations that human lungs had not evolved to process. You could
breathe it, mostly. But sometimes you couldn't. And the transition from
one to the other happened without warning.

She descended from the overpass along a path that had been a staircase
and was now a suggestion of a staircase -- the steps visible as faint
gradations in the dissolution, each one a slightly denser region of
not-quite-matter that supported her weight if she moved quickly and did
not think too hard about what she was standing on. The first rule of
scavenging in the dissolution zones was: don't stop moving. The second
rule was: don't look too closely at anything. The third rule was: don't
think about the people who used to live here.

Delia broke the third rule every time.

She was thirty-one years old. She had been a structural engineer before
the war, which gave her an understanding of material science that was
useful in the zones and a sensitivity to the wrongness of what she saw
that was not. She knew what steel was supposed to do. She knew how
concrete behaved. She understood, at a fundamental level, the forces
that held buildings upright and the forces that brought them down. What
the Unraveling had done was neither. It was something else. Something
that her engineering textbooks had not prepared her for, because her
engineering textbooks assumed that molecular bonds were permanent, that
the forces holding matter together were constants of the universe, and
the Unraveling had proven, with terrible efficiency, that they were not.

She moved through the ghost of a neighborhood. Houses stood on either
side of the street, their walls translucent, their roofs drifting upward
in slow motion, their contents -- furniture, appliances, photographs,
the accumulated matter of human lives -- suspended in various stages of
dissolution, some almost intact, some reduced to drifting clouds of
particulate that caught the sunlight and glowed. A kitchen table hung in
the air with three of its four legs already gone, the fourth still
attached by bonds that would dissolve in a day or a week or a year. A
child's bicycle stood upright in a yard, its frame half-dissolved, its
wheels turning slowly in a breeze that did not exist.

She was looking for anything intact. Intact objects in the dissolution
zones were rare and valuable -- the Unraveling was not perfectly uniform,
and occasionally, for reasons that no one understood, an object would
survive within the radius, its bonds untouched, its structure whole.
These objects fetched high prices in the refugee markets. Not because
they were useful. Because they were real. In a world where three -- or
four, or six, or twelve -- cities had been reduced to clouds of
dissociated molecules, a coffee mug that you could hold in your hands
and know, with absolute certainty, that it would still be a coffee mug
tomorrow, was worth more than its weight in anything.

She found a few small items in the first hour. A ceramic bowl, white with
blue flowers, untouched. A glass paperweight with a butterfly preserved
inside it. A cast-iron doorstop shaped like a dog. She placed each one
carefully in her pack and moved deeper into the zone, toward the city
center, where the dissolution was thickest and the risk was greatest and
the intact objects, if any existed, would be the most valuable.

She found the child at the intersection of what had been Wisconsin Avenue
and what had been Third Street.

The girl was sitting on the curb. She was perhaps seven years old. She
wore a blue dress and white shoes and her dark hair was tied back with a
ribbon that was the exact shade of red that Delia associated with
September, with autumn, with the world before. She sat with her knees
drawn up and her arms wrapped around them and she looked up at Delia with
eyes that were clear and calm and utterly, impossibly present.

She was intact. Completely. Not a hair dissolved. Not a thread of her
dress loosened. She sat in the middle of the dissolution zone like a
stone in a river, the unraveled world drifting around her, and she was
whole.

Delia stopped.

The girl looked at her.

"Hello," Delia said. Her voice was muffled by the filter mask. She pulled
it down. The air here was breathable. The air immediately around the girl
was breathable. It was, in fact, the cleanest air Delia had encountered
in the zone -- no dissolution artifacts, no molecular drift, just air,
pure and simple and real.

"Hello," the girl said. Her voice was small and steady. "Are you real?"

"Yes. Are you?"

The girl considered this with the gravity of a child for whom the question
was not rhetorical. "I think so," she said. "I don't remember."

"Don't remember what?"

"Anything. I was here. And then everything went away. And then I was
still here."

Delia sat down on the curb beside her. The concrete was solid. Actually,
genuinely solid. She could feel its gritty texture through her pants,
could sense the aggregate and the cement and the rebar beneath, all of
it intact, all of it real. The dissolution zone extended in every
direction -- she could see the ghostly outlines of buildings, the
drifting particulate, the slow, terrible dissolution of a city -- but
here, at this intersection, in a radius of perhaps ten feet around this
child, the world was whole.

"What's your name?" Delia asked.

"I don't remember."

"Where are your parents?"

The girl looked at the dissolution around them. She looked at it without
fear, without horror, without any of the reactions that Delia would have
expected from a seven-year-old sitting in the ruins of a city that had
been unmade at the molecular level. She looked at it the way you might
look at rain. A fact. A condition. A thing that was.

"They went away," she said. "Everything went away."

"But you didn't."

"No."

Delia opened her pack. She took out a water bottle and a protein bar and
offered them to the girl. The girl took the water and drank carefully,
holding the bottle with both hands, and the normalcy of the gesture -- a
child drinking water, the most ordinary thing in the world -- hit Delia
with a force that she was not prepared for, a wave of grief so sharp that
it took her breath.

She had a daughter once. Before the war. Before the Unraveling. A
daughter named Clara, who was nine, who lived in Chicago, which was the
second city hit. Or the first. Nobody was sure anymore. Delia did not
talk about Clara. She did not think about Clara. She had built a wall
inside herself, as solid as the concrete she used to engineer, and on
one side of the wall was the person she was now -- the scavenger, the
survivor, the woman who walked through ghost cities and collected intact
objects for the refugee markets -- and on the other side was everything
else. The wall held. Most days, the wall held.

This was not most days.

She looked at this child who should not exist and she saw Clara. Not
literally -- this girl was younger, darker-haired, different in every
particular -- but essentially. Essentially, every child was Clara. Every
small hand reaching for a water bottle, every pair of clear eyes looking
up with trust, every voice asking "are you real?" was Clara, and the
wall inside Delia creaked but held, and she breathed, and she was
professional, and she did what needed to be done.

"I'm going to take you out of here," she said. "There are people outside
the zone. Doctors. They'll take care of you. Okay?"

The girl nodded. She stood. She took Delia's hand.

Her hand was warm. Warm and small and alive. Delia held it and felt the
bones beneath the skin and the pulse in the wrist and the slight, sticky
dampness of a child's palm, and she thought: this is real. This is the
most real thing I have touched in months.

They walked.

The dissolution zone was three miles across. Delia had entered from the
west. The nearest safe perimeter was to the south. Three miles through
the ghost of a city, over streets that were barely streets, past
buildings that were barely buildings, through air that was mostly air.
Three miles with a child who should not exist.

The girl walked without hesitation. She did not stumble on the
semi-dissolved pavement. She did not flinch when a wall drifted apart
beside them, its bricks separating like a flock of birds taking flight,
each one dissolving into a cloud of red-brown particulate that hung in
the air and slowly faded. She walked through the ruins of Milwaukee with
the steady, purposeful gait of someone who knew where she was going,
even though she could not remember where she had been.

They passed the ghost of a school. The building was more intact than
most -- the outer walls still mostly solid, the roof still attached,
though the windows had dissolved into shimmering rectangles of not-quite-
glass that let in a light that was not quite light. Through the open
doorway, Delia could see rows of desks, each one slightly out of focus,
slightly translucent, the metal legs fading into the floor like roots.
On one desk, a book lay open. Its pages were turning. Not from wind --
there was no wind -- but from the dissolution itself, the binding
loosening, the pages separating, each one drifting upward with the
terrible gentleness of a thing letting go of what held it together.
The words on the pages were still visible. Delia did not stop to read
them. She did not want to know what lesson had been interrupted.

The girl stopped.

"I went to school here," she said. Not as a memory -- her voice held no
recognition, no warmth, no nostalgia. She said it as a fact, the way
she might say "it is raining" or "the sky is blue." A thing she knew
without knowing how she knew it.

"You remember?"

"No. But my feet do." She looked down at her white shoes on the
dissolving pavement. "They wanted to stop."

Delia said nothing. She held the girl's hand and waited. After a
moment, the girl looked up at her and said, "We can go now," and they
went.

The deeper they moved into the zone, the worse it got. The dissolution
was not uniform -- it came in waves, in eddies, in sudden pockets of
almost-total annihilation where the air itself seemed to thin and the
light bent in ways that made Delia's eyes water. In these pockets, the
world was barely there at all. Buildings reduced to faint geometric
suggestions. Cars dissolved to clouds of metal vapor that hung in
the rough shapes of sedans and trucks. And everywhere, the light -- the
strange, wrong, beautiful light of a world whose molecules had forgotten
how to absorb and reflect in the usual proportions, scattering photons
in every direction, turning the dissolution zone into a place of
unearthly, devastating radiance.

It was beautiful. That was the thing Delia could never quite reconcile.
The dissolution zone was beautiful. The ghost city glowed. The drifting
particulate caught the sunlight and turned it into spectra that no
intact material could produce. The air itself shimmered with molecular
iridescence. If you didn't know what you were looking at -- if you
didn't know that every glowing particle had once been part of a building
or a road or a person -- it might have been the most beautiful thing
you'd ever seen.

Delia knew what she was looking at. She thought about the people who
had lived in these houses, driven these cars, walked these streets. She
thought about the moment of the Unraveling -- the flash, the silence,
the slow, gentle, hideous dissolution of everything they knew and were
and loved. Had they felt it? Had they had time to understand what was
happening? Or had it been instant -- one moment whole, the next moment
particulate, the transition so fast that consciousness itself dissolved
before it could register its own ending?

She did not know. Nobody knew. Nobody who had been inside the radius
had survived to describe the experience.

Nobody except the girl holding her hand.

And the zone changed around her.

Delia noticed it first in the pavement. Wherever the girl stepped, the
ground solidified. Not permanently -- the dissolution crept back after
they passed, like water filling a footprint in sand -- but for the
moment of contact, the ground was real. Solid. Whole. The girl's
footsteps left impressions in intact concrete that dissolved seconds
later, and the impression was not just physical but structural, as
though her presence reminded the molecules of what they were supposed
to be doing.

"How are you doing that?" Delia asked.

"Doing what?"

"The ground. You're fixing it."

The girl looked down at her feet. She looked up at Delia. "I'm not doing
anything," she said. "I'm just walking."

They passed through what had been a park. The trees were still standing
-- or their ghosts were, translucent trunks supporting canopies of
dissolving leaves that drifted downward in a slow, silent, endless
autumn. But as the girl walked beneath them, the leaves solidified. For
a moment -- just a moment -- the park was whole. Green and real and
alive, the trees solid, the grass firm, the leaves casting actual shadows
on actual ground. Then they passed, and the dissolution returned, and
the park was a ghost again.

"You're not just intact," Delia said, half to herself. "You're an anchor.
A fixed point. The dissolution can't touch you, and anything near you--"

"I don't understand," the girl said.

"Neither do I."

They walked. The zone thinned as they approached the southern perimeter.
The buildings became more solid, the air more reliable, the ground more
certain. The girl's effect became less dramatic as the dissolution became
less severe, until, at the very edge of the zone, where the world
transitioned from unmade to made, from ghost to real, the girl was simply
a girl, walking through a damaged but recognizable city, holding the hand
of a woman who had come to find things that survived.

At the boundary of the zone, they passed through a region where the
dissolution existed in a state of visible transition. Half-buildings.
Quarter-cars. A fire hydrant that was solid from the base to about three
feet up and then faded into mist, as though the Unraveling had gotten
bored halfway through. A mailbox with letters still inside it, the metal
of the box dissolving around them, the paper somehow intact, postcards
and bills and a handwritten letter that Delia did not read because
reading other people's mail felt obscene even when the people were gone,
even when the mailbox was dissolving, even when the very concept of
privacy had been Unraveled along with everything else.

The girl stopped and picked up a stone from the ground. A real stone.
Solid. She held it in her hand and looked at it with an intensity that
made Delia's chest ache.

"It stays," the girl said.

"What?"

"The stone. When I hold it. It stays together."

Delia looked at the stone in the girl's small hand. It was an ordinary
gray stone, the kind you might find in any driveway, unremarkable in
every way except that it was real and it was here and the child who held
it could keep it that way.

"Keep it," Delia said. "It's yours."

The girl put the stone in the pocket of her blue dress and they walked
on.

The perimeter camp was a sprawl of tents and prefab shelters, staffed by
exhausted medical personnel and guarded by soldiers who had forgotten what
they were guarding against. Delia led the girl to the medical tent.
Heads turned. Eyes widened. A child. Alive. From the zone.

"Where did you find her?" the doctor asked. Young. Tired. Astonished.

"City center. Intersection of Wisconsin and Third. She was sitting on
the curb."

"That's deep in the zone. Nothing's intact that deep."

"She is."

The doctor examined the girl with the gentle thoroughness of someone who
expected to find something wrong and was unsettled to find nothing. Vital
signs normal. Neurological function normal. No signs of dissolution
exposure. No signs of anything. A perfectly healthy seven-year-old girl
with no name, no memory, and no explanation for how she had survived the
annihilation of a city.

"There's something else," Delia said. She took the doctor aside. "She
stabilizes the zone. Wherever she walks, the dissolution reverses. The
ground solidifies. The air clears. It's temporary, but it's real. She's
some kind of... I don't know. Antidote."

The doctor looked at her. He looked at the girl, who sat on the
examination table with her feet dangling, eating an apple that a nurse
had given her with the focused attention of a child who has been hungry
for a long time.

"That's impossible," he said.

Delia thought of the ghost city. She thought of the trees that became
real as the girl passed beneath them. She thought of the footprints in
solid concrete that dissolved seconds later. She thought of the small,
warm hand in hers and the pulse that beat in the thin wrist and the
steady, calm eyes that looked at the unraveled world without fear.

"Yes," she said. "It is."

She did not leave. She told herself it was because the girl had no one
else, and this was true. She told herself it was because the girl was a
scientific anomaly that deserved study, and this was also true. But the
real reason -- the reason she did not examine too closely, because
examining it would mean acknowledging things about herself that she had
spent the months since the war very carefully not acknowledging -- was
that the girl was real. In a world where cities dissolved and matter
forgot what it was and the very ground beneath your feet could not be
trusted, this child was real, and being near her made the world real
too, and Delia Cross, who had lost her own city and her own home and
people whose names she could not say without the grief rising up like
bile, needed something real to hold on to.

She named the girl Maya. It was not her real name. Her real name was
in the dissolution zone, along with her parents and her home and every
other trace of the life she had lived before the world came undone. But
she needed a name, and Delia gave her one, and the girl accepted it with
the quiet gravity of someone who understood that names, like molecular
bonds, could be dissolved and reformed and that the new configuration
was no less real than the old.

They stayed at the perimeter camp. The scientists came -- of course they
did, with their instruments and their theories and their desperate hope
that this child might hold the key to reversing the Unraveling, to
rebuilding the cities, to making the world solid again. They studied
Maya. They measured her. They mapped the field of stability that
surrounded her, that extended ten feet in every direction and grew
stronger when she was calm and weaker when she was afraid and disappeared
entirely when she slept, as though the force that held her together
required consciousness to maintain itself.

They did not find an explanation. The girl was a girl. Her cells were
human cells. Her DNA was human DNA. There was nothing unusual about her
biology, nothing that their instruments could detect, nothing that
distinguished her from any other seven-year-old child except that she
was alive when she should not have been and the world was whole when
she was near.

Delia watched the scientists and said nothing. She held Maya's hand when
the instruments frightened her. She read to her at night from books that
Delia scavenged from the zone's edges -- actual books, paper and ink,
surprisingly intact, as though the written word had a structural
integrity that resisted the Unraveling better than concrete or steel.
She tucked her in and sat beside her while she slept and watched the
field of stability shrink and fade as consciousness left, and she
thought about what it meant that a child could hold the world together
and that the world could not hold itself.

One night, Maya woke from a dream. Her eyes were wide. Her hand found
Delia's in the dark.

"I remember," she said.

"What do you remember?"

"The light. When everything went away. There was a light, and it was
inside everything, and it was taking everything apart. And I was afraid.
And then I wasn't afraid. And then the light was inside me too. But it
didn't take me apart. It..." She paused, searching for words that a
seven-year-old's vocabulary did not contain. "It put me together. More
together. Like everything that was coming undone around me was going into
me instead. Like I was catching it."

Delia held her hand. The tent was dark. Outside, the dissolution zone
glowed faintly in the distance, the ghost of a city lit by the slow
luminescence of molecules remembering what they had been.

"You caught it," Delia said.

"I caught it. And now I have it. All of it. The buildings and the trees
and the streets and the people. They're inside me. They're why I'm
real."

Delia said nothing. She held the girl's hand and looked at the glow on
the horizon and understood, with a clarity that hurt, that Maya was not
a survivor. She was a vessel. A repository. The Unraveling had dissolved
a city, and the city -- or its essence, its pattern, the informational
content of its molecular bonds -- had not been destroyed. It had been
absorbed. By a seven-year-old girl who had been afraid and then not
afraid and who carried within her small, warm, intact body the ghost of
everything that had been lost.

"Can you put it back?" Delia asked. She didn't mean to. The question
asked itself.

Maya looked at her. Seven years old. Clear eyes. Calm.

"I don't know," she said. "I don't know how."

"That's okay."

"Is it?"

Delia thought about it. She thought about the dissolved cities and the
broken world and the scientists who wanted Maya to be a cure, a weapon,
a tool for reconstruction. She thought about the weight of a city inside
a child. She thought about what it would cost to put it back, and whether
the cost would be paid by the city or by the girl.

"Yes," she said. "It's okay. You don't have to fix anything. You don't
have to put anything back. You just have to be here. That's enough."

Maya leaned against her. The field of stability pulsed outward, ten
feet, twenty, thirty, and the ground beneath the tent became more solid
than it had been in months, and the air became cleaner, and the distant
glow of the dissolution zone dimmed, just slightly, just for a moment,
as if the ghost of Milwaukee had heard its own heartbeat and recognized
it as the heartbeat of a child who had caught it when it fell.

"Delia?" the girl said.

"Yes?"

"Don't let go."

"I won't."

She didn't.

                     SÉANCE IN THE STATIC

                      by Robert "Bob" Finley

============================================================================

Gus Henley was halfway through a ham sandwich and three-quarters of the
way through his Thursday night shift when the dead started talking.

He didn't know they were dead at first. All he knew was that Band 7,
Sub-frequency 42.7, which had been pure static for the entire eighteen
months he'd been stationed at the Cygnus Relay Post, was suddenly
producing a signal. A clear, strong, unmistakable signal, right in the
middle of a frequency band that the International Space Communications
Authority had designated as "reserved" -- which was bureaucratic code for
"nothing uses this band, nothing has ever used this band, and nothing is
expected to use this band at any point in the foreseeable future."

Gus set down his sandwich. He adjusted his headset. He fine-tuned the
receiver. The signal sharpened.

It was voices. Human voices. At least four of them, maybe more, speaking
over each other in the way that people do when they're excited or scared
or both. The transmission quality was poor -- the voices faded in and out,
washed by static, broken by interference that sounded like solar wind but
wasn't, because solar wind didn't produce interference on Band 7. Nothing
produced interference on Band 7. Nothing produced *anything* on Band 7.

Gus grabbed his log book and started writing.

"Unknown signal, Band 7, Sub-freq 42.7. Multiple voices, human origin.
Signal strength: moderate. Point of origin: unknown. Interference pattern:
non-standard. Time: 23:47 station time, October 30th."

October 30th. The night before Halloween. Gus noted this with the weary
amusement of a man who had spent too many holidays in the company of
radio equipment and too few in the company of other people. If this was
the universe's idea of a trick-or-treat, the timing was impeccable.

He listened. The voices resolved slowly, like a photograph developing,
the words emerging from the static in fragments:

"...can you hear us? Is anyone..."

"...the circle must remain unbroken..."

"...we've been trying to reach..."

"...seventeen months. It's been seventeen months since..."

Gus pressed the transmit key. "This is Cygnus Relay Post, operator
Augustus Henley. I am receiving your transmission on Band 7, Sub-frequency
42.7. Please identify yourselves and state your position. Over."

Silence. Then a burst of static. Then a voice -- clearer now, a woman's
voice, steady and calm with an undercurrent of something that Gus would
later identify as desperate, exhausted hope:

"Oh God. Oh God, someone's there. Someone can hear us."

"I can hear you. Please identify. Who is this?"

"This is Dr. Lena Vasquez, mission commander of the deep-space survey
vessel *Arcturus*. We are... we are not where we're supposed to be. We
need help. Please. We need help."

Gus's pen stopped moving. The *Arcturus*. He knew that name. Everyone
who worked in deep-space communications knew that name. The *Arcturus*
had departed Earth orbit twenty-nine months ago on a survey mission to
the outer system. Contact had been lost seventeen months later, after the
ship failed to make its scheduled check-in from the vicinity of Neptune.
A search had been conducted. No wreckage had been found. No signal. No
debris. The *Arcturus* and its crew of eight had simply vanished, as
completely as if they had never existed, and after six months of silence,
the International Space Communications Authority had declared them lost
with all hands.

That was two years ago.

"Dr. Vasquez," Gus said carefully, "the *Arcturus* was declared lost
twenty-four months ago. Can you confirm your identity? Can you tell me
your crew complement and mission designation?"

"Yes. Yes, of course. Crew of eight. Mission designation: DSV-Arcturus-
Outer-7. Commander Vasquez, pilot Chen, navigator Okoye, engineer
Morrison, science officers Kleiner and Tanaka, medical officer Reeves,
communications officer Blake. We are all here. We are all alive. We
are..." A pause. Static. When Vasquez spoke again, her voice was smaller.
"We don't know where we are."

"Can you give me coordinates? Navigational data? Anything?"

"No. There are no stars. There is nothing to navigate by. We are in a
place where there is nothing. We have been here for seventeen months --
or what feels like seventeen months, but time... time doesn't work right
here. The clocks run. They don't agree with each other. Officer Blake has
been trying to reach someone -- anyone -- since we arrived. We've been
broadcasting on every frequency, every band, every protocol. Nothing got
through. Nothing, until tonight."

"What's special about tonight?"

Another pause. Gus heard voices in the background -- the other crew
members, talking over each other, urgent, frightened, hopeful. Then
Vasquez again:

"Blake says the frequency opened. He's been scanning continuously, and
tonight, at exactly 23:47, Band 7 opened. Like a door. Like someone
unlocked it from the other side. He says..." She stopped. When she
continued, her voice was careful, precise, the voice of a scientist
reporting data that she did not believe. "He says it's not a radio
frequency. Not really. It's something else that's using radio as a
medium. He says it feels like a channel that was always there but only
becomes accessible under certain conditions."

"What conditions?"

"We don't know. But Blake has a theory. He thinks... this is going to
sound insane."

"Dr. Vasquez, you're transmitting from a ship that's been declared dead
for two years on a frequency that doesn't exist. We passed insane about
three minutes ago. What's Blake's theory?"

The ghost of a laugh. "He thinks it's a seance."

Gus blinked. "Come again?"

"A seance. A spiritual communication channel. He thinks that whatever
happened to us -- whatever pulled us out of normal space into this...
place -- it put us somewhere that's analogous to what spiritualists call
the other side. And Band 7 is the frequency that connects this side to
that one. And it only opens when the connection between the living and
the dead is strongest."

"And when is that?"

"Halloween," Vasquez said. "Blake says it's Halloween. Or close enough.
The veil between worlds, the thinning of barriers -- he says it's not
superstition. It's physics. Physics that we don't understand yet, but
physics. There are places in the universe where the membrane between
normal space and... whatever this is... becomes permeable. And there are
times when that permeability increases. And one of those times is now."

Gus looked at his calendar. October 30th. 23:47. In thirteen minutes,
it would be Halloween.

"Dr. Vasquez, I'm going to contact ISCA headquarters. I'm going to
report this communication and request a full search-and-rescue--"

"No." The word was sharp. "Don't break the connection. Blake says the
channel is fragile. If you switch to another frequency, if you
interrupt the transmission for even a moment, we might lose it. And we
don't know if it will open again. We don't know if we have another
year. We don't know if we have another minute."

"I understand that, but I need to--"

"Henley." Vasquez's voice was steady now. The hope was gone. In its
place was the calm of a woman who had spent seventeen months in a
place where there was nothing and had made her peace with the possibility
that there would never be anything again. "Listen to me. This isn't a
rescue call. I know that. We all know that. You can't come get us. You
don't know where we are. WE don't know where we are. There's nothing
here -- no stars, no planets, no coordinates, no reference points.
We're somewhere that doesn't have a where."

"Then what is this?"

"This is a voice in the dark. This is eight people who haven't talked
to anyone but each other for seventeen months saying hello to someone
new. This is a dead crew calling home to say: we're here. We're still
here."

Gus sat in his chair in the Cygnus Relay Post, alone, eighteen months
into a posting that was supposed to be a quiet career milestone and had
turned into the loneliest assignment in the Communications Authority's
roster. He sat in his chair and he listened to the voice of a dead
woman -- not dead, he corrected himself, not dead, just gone, just
somewhere else, somewhere that had no stars and no time and no where --
and he said:

"Okay. I'm here. I'm listening. Tell me everything."

They talked. For three hours, twelve minutes, and forty-seven seconds --
Gus timed it, because timing things was his job and because he sensed
that this transmission, whatever else it was, was the most important
thing he would ever record -- they talked.

Vasquez went first. She told him about the event: a flash of light near
Neptune, a sensation of movement without motion, and then darkness,
absolute darkness, the kind of darkness that exists not because light is
absent but because there is nothing for light to illuminate. She told
him about the first hours, when the crew had run every diagnostic and
found the ship intact, every system operational, as though nothing had
happened -- except that outside the viewports, the stars were gone. Not
occluded, not hidden behind dust or gas. Gone. As if the universe had
simply stopped extending in any direction beyond the hull. She told him
about the moment when the crew had realized, with the slow, creeping
certainty of a nightmare, that they were not in space anymore. Space
had properties -- vacuum, radiation, gravitational fields, the cosmic
microwave background. Wherever they were had none of these. It was the
absence of properties. The null set. The blank page on which the
universe had been written, with the text somehow erased.

Chen came on next. The pilot was a calm man by nature -- you had to be,
to fly deep-space missions, where the margin between a successful burn
and a catastrophic one was measured in fractions of degrees -- and his
voice carried the clipped, factual cadence of someone giving a flight
report. Ship intact, he confirmed. All systems functional. Power
nominal. Life support nominal. Navigation -- and here his voice caught,
just slightly, a hitch that Gus recognized as a man swallowing
something he did not want to swallow -- navigation was impossible,
because navigation required reference points, and there were no
reference points, and the gyroscopes and accelerometers, which should
have been registering the ship's orientation and velocity, registered
nothing, as if the concepts of orientation and velocity did not apply
here.

"We're not moving," Chen said. "But we're not stationary, either. We're
just... present. Like a thought that hasn't been thought yet. Like a
word on the tip of someone's tongue."

Morrison, the engineer, was less poetic but no less shaken. He reported
on the ship's supplies with the grim precision of a man who had been
counting cans for seventeen months: sufficient for another six months,
maybe eight with strict rationing. Water recycling was functional. Air
recycling was functional. The ship was designed for a three-year mission
and they were two and a half years in. The math was not complicated. The
math was, in fact, the simplest thing about their situation, and
Morrison clung to it the way a drowning man clings to wreckage.

Science officers Kleiner and Tanaka had spent the seventeen months
studying their environment -- or trying to, because studying an
environment that lacked properties was, as Kleiner put it, "like trying
to write a paper about the color of invisibility." Instruments detected
nothing. Sensors registered nothing. Probes launched into the darkness
disappeared instantly, transmitting no data, leaving no trace. The only
thing that existed, as far as their instruments could determine, was the
ship itself. Everything else was not so much empty as nonexistent, not
so much dark as un-lit, not so much silent as un-sounded.

Reeves, the medical officer, described the crew's mental state with the
careful understatement of her profession: strained but holding. She did
not elaborate on what "strained" meant, but Gus could hear it in the
background -- in the way the voices overlapped with a slight edge of
desperation, in the too-quick laughter that followed Vasquez's
occasional attempts at humor, in the silence that fell sometimes between
sentences, a silence that was not merely the absence of speech but the
presence of something else, something that seventeen months in the void
between existence and non-existence had etched into these eight people
like acid into metal. "Hope is a thing with feathers," Reeves said,
quoting someone she did not identify, "and sometimes those feathers are
made of radio static and a stranger's voice in the dark."

Blake came on last. Communications Officer David Blake, who had spent
seventeen months scanning every frequency in the electromagnetic
spectrum, who had built improvised antennas from spare parts and
modified the ship's transmitter to broadcast on bands that the equipment
had never been designed to reach, who had, in the absence of anyone to
talk to, become a student of the silence itself.

"The frequency isn't electromagnetic," Blake said. His voice was soft,
almost reverent. "I know that sounds contradictory -- you're receiving
it on a radio, it manifests as radio waves -- but the carrier signal is
something else. Something that uses electromagnetic radiation the way a
surfer uses a wave. The wave is physical. The surfer isn't part of the
wave. I think Band 7 has always been a conduit for this other thing --
this communication medium that exists underneath normal physics. And I
think the reason it's 'reserved' and unused is that the people who
established the frequency allocations -- the original engineers, back
in the earliest days of space communication -- they noticed something
about Band 7. They couldn't explain it. So they roped it off and
pretended it wasn't there."

"And it opens on Halloween?"

"It opens when the boundary conditions are right. Halloween is one of
those times. Not because of magic. Because of geometry. The Earth's
position relative to certain gravitational features, the angle of the
solar wind, the configuration of the outer planets -- all of these
things affect the permeability of the membrane between normal space and
where we are. And once a year, give or take, the geometry aligns. The
membrane thins. The frequency opens."

"For how long?"

Silence. Static. Then Blake, very quietly:

"I don't know. I think we're already losing it."

Gus looked at his instruments. The signal strength, which had been
moderate but steady for the past three hours, was declining. The static
was thickening. The voices were starting to fade, the way voices fade
when someone is walking away from you, growing smaller and more distant
with each step.

"Vasquez," he said. "The signal's dropping. If there's anything else--"

"Wait." It was Tanaka. The science officer's voice was calm, academic,
the voice of someone who has spent seventeen months studying the
impossible and has arrived at a theory she needs to share before the
window closes. "The frequency. Band 7, Sub-42.7. Write this down. The
harmonics suggest a resonance pattern. If you modulated a transmission
at -- " a burst of static swallowed the numbers " -- you might be able
to sustain the channel. Artificially. Not just on Halloween. You might
be able to keep the door open."

"Say again? I lost the numbers."

"Seven point -- " static " -- modulated at -- " static " -- phase-
locked to the -- " The signal was breaking apart now, Tanaka's voice
fragmenting into syllables that lost their meaning, each word arriving
with gaps where the critical information should have been, like a
letter with every other sentence redacted. Gus pressed the headset
closer, as if proximity to the speakers could somehow close the
distance between here and wherever they were. He caught fragments.
Numbers. Fractions of numbers. A formula that might have been the key
to everything or might have been nothing at all.

"I'm sorry," he said. "I'm losing you. Tanaka, I'm losing you."

"It's all right." Vasquez again. Her voice was faint now, barely
audible above the rising static, but steady. Calm. "Tell them we're not
dead. Tell them we're here. Tell them that if they listen on the right
frequency at the right time, they can hear us. We're not ghosts,
Henley. We're just far away."

"I'll tell them. I swear I'll tell them."

"And Henley?"

"Yeah?"

"Thank you. For listening. For staying on the line. For not hanging up
when a dead woman started talking. You have no idea what this meant."

"I think I do."

Static. A burst of interference that sounded like wind or like breathing
or like the sound the universe makes when it exhales. And then silence.
Band 7, Sub-frequency 42.7, returned to its customary state of absolute,
unbroken nothing.

Gus sat in his chair for a long time. His ham sandwich was still on the
desk, one bite missing. His log book was full -- page after page of
notes, frequencies, timestamps, the names and words of eight people who
were somewhere that didn't have a where. He looked at the clock. 03:00
station time. October 31st.

Halloween.

He sat in the silence that followed the transmission and he thought
about the *Arcturus* crew, floating in their ship in a darkness that
was not darkness, in a void that was not the void of space, in a place
that had no where and no when and no way out. He thought about Vasquez,
who had laughed at the end, a real laugh, the laugh of a woman who had
been given something she had not expected: the sound of another human
voice. He thought about Blake, whose theory -- crazy, impossible,
beautiful Blake with his metaphysics disguised as physics -- had been
right. The frequency had opened. The veil had thinned. The dead had
spoken to the living, and the living had listened, and for three hours
and twelve minutes and forty-seven seconds, the distance between them
had been nothing but the width of a radio wave.

He thought about his own isolation. Eighteen months on Cygnus Relay,
alone. He had applied for the posting because it was prestigious, a
senior assignment that would look good on his record, and he had stayed
because -- well, because someone had to, and because the silence of a
relay post was a comfortable silence, the silence of purpose, of a man
doing a job that mattered even if no one noticed. But tonight he had
learned what silence really was. Not the absence of sound but the
absence of someone to hear it. The *Arcturus* crew had been silent for
seventeen months. Not because there was nothing to say but because
there was no one to hear. And that, Gus realized, was a different kind
of silence entirely. That was the silence that kills.

He filed his report in the morning. It was received with the skepticism
he expected and the investigation he demanded and the conclusion he
feared: operator fatigue, signal artifact, a combination of loneliness
and imagination that produced a convincing but ultimately inexplicable
auditory hallucination. The logs were noted. The recording -- because
Gus had, of course, recorded the entire transmission -- was analyzed and
declared "inconclusive." The ISCA technical panel listened to the
recording three times. They heard static. They heard what might have
been voices or might have been signal echo or might have been the
random electromagnetic noise of deep space shaped by a lonely man's
imagination into something that sounded like conversation. They
acknowledged that the signal was anomalous. They declined to speculate
on its origin. They recommended that Operator Henley be evaluated for
psychological fitness and, pending evaluation, retained at his post.

The evaluation found him fit. Of course it did. Gus was sane. He was
competent. He was not hallucinating. He was a man who had heard
something real on a frequency that should have been empty, and the fact
that no one believed him did not make it less real. It made it lonelier.

The *Arcturus* remained officially lost with all hands.

But Gus kept listening. Every night, every shift, he tuned to Band 7,
Sub-frequency 42.7, and he waited. Three hundred and sixty-four nights
of static. Three hundred and sixty-four nights of nothing. Three hundred
and sixty-four nights of sitting in the dark with his headset on and
his log book open and his pen ready, listening to the hiss and crackle
of a frequency that the universe had set aside for reasons that no one
understood, waiting for a door to open that only opened once a year.

On the three hundred and sixty-fifth night -- October 30th, 23:47
station time -- the frequency opened.

"Henley? Are you there?"

"I'm here, Vasquez. I'm here."

"Happy Halloween."

He laughed. In the dark, in the silence, in the space between a dead
crew and a living operator, separated by a distance that was not a
distance and connected by a frequency that was not a frequency, Gus
Henley laughed, and somewhere -- somewhere that had no where -- eight
voices laughed with him.

He pulled out a fresh log book. He picked up his pen. He pressed the
transmit key.

"Tell me everything," he said. "We've got all night."

The signal held until dawn.

                         [END]

============================================================================

                  MASQUERADE AT THE END OF TIME

                        by Oscar Lennox

============================================================================

The invitation arrived in the manner of all things at the End of Time:
inexplicably, instantaneously, and with a faint but unmistakable odor of
paradox.

Lord Crystalline of the Seventh Effulgence discovered it resting upon his
breakfast tray, nestled between the self-replenishing goblet of
philosophical wine and the small bowl of ontological almonds that
constituted his morning meal. The card was heavy, cream-colored, edged in
a gold that was not merely metallic but *conceptually* gold -- gold as an
abstract principle rather than an element, gold that represented the idea
of opulence without troubling itself over atomic structure. The script was
elegant, each letter rendered in an ink that shifted color as one read,
passing through the visible spectrum and several spectra that had been
invented specifically for this purpose.

It read:

    YOU ARE CORDIALLY INVITED
    to the
    GRAND MASQUERADE OF THE FINAL ERA
    An Evening of Civilizational Costume

    Come as you were. Come as they were.
    Come as the thing the universe remembers.

    Dress: Mandatory. Identity: Forbidden.

    The Ballroom at the Edge of Entropy
    This evening. All evenings. The distinction is academic.

Lord Crystalline read the invitation twice, turned it over to examine
the back (blank, save for a small embossed symbol that resembled either
an hourglass or an infinity sign, depending on the angle at which one
held it), and said, to no one in particular: "Ah. How delightful. A
party."

The End of Time was not, despite its name, a time. It was a condition --
a state of affairs in which entropy, having been reversed by the
collective will of the Final Beings, had ceased to operate in its
customary direction, and the universe, instead of winding down toward
heat death, had settled into a state of permanent, luxurious stasis.
Nothing decayed. Nothing was born. Nothing changed, except by deliberate
choice, and the Final Beings -- of whom Lord Crystalline was a
representative example -- had long since exhausted the interesting
choices and were now occupied primarily with the less interesting ones,
of which there were, it turned out, an inexhaustible supply.

A costume party, therefore, was not merely a social event. It was an
act of archaeological imagination, a recreation of the lost concept of
*novelty* -- that quaint notion, popular among the extinct civilizations,
that a thing could be encountered for the first time. The Final Beings
could not encounter anything for the first time. They had existed for
too long. They had seen everything, known everything, been everything.
The only frontier left was pretense -- the delicate art of pretending
that one had not already experienced every possible configuration of
matter and meaning.

Lord Crystalline selected his costume with care.

He considered going as the Thermian Concordance, that magnificent
civilization of sentient heat-patterns who had thrived in the hearts of
stars and communicated through variations in plasma flow. Their culture
had produced the greatest musical tradition the universe had ever known
-- symphonies composed in frequencies that could be perceived only by
beings who existed at temperatures exceeding ten million degrees. Lord
Crystalline had attended several of their performances, in a previous
body, and had found them exquisite.

He considered the Reticulum -- those austere geometers who had built
their entire civilization on the surface of a single neutron star, their
architecture constrained to two dimensions by the crushing gravity,
their philosophy preoccupied with the question of whether a third
dimension was a physical reality or merely a pleasant fiction. Lord
Crystalline had debated this question with their last philosopher and
had come away unconvinced by both sides.

He considered the Bloom, whose name in their own language was a scent
rather than a word -- a vast, slow, photosynthetic intelligence that had
covered an entire galaxy in a web of interconnected plant-like organisms,
thinking thoughts that took ten thousand years to complete and arriving
at conclusions of such profound simplicity that other civilizations
wept to hear them.

In the end, he chose the Opalescent Hegemony: a civilization of
light-sculptors who had existed for approximately eight billion years
and whose final artistic achievement had been to reshape the cosmic
microwave background radiation into a self-portrait so vast that it
could only be perceived from outside the observable universe. Lord
Crystalline had always admired their ambition.

He dressed. His body -- which was, like all bodies at the End of Time,
a voluntary arrangement of matter maintained by will and habit -- reshaped
itself into the characteristic form of an Opalescent: a tall, slender
figure composed of overlapping planes of polarized light, each plane a
different color, the whole assembly shimmering and shifting like an
aurora trapped in a humanoid frame. He added the traditional Opalescent
accessories: a crown of frozen photons, a sash of woven darkness (actual
darkness, compressed and spun into a textile), and a small hand-mirror
that reflected not what was but what should be.

He was, he decided, rather dashing.

The Ballroom at the Edge of Entropy occupied a region of space that had
been specifically constructed for the purpose: a sphere approximately two
light-years in diameter, its interior decorated in the style of every
major architectural tradition the universe had ever produced,
simultaneously. Corinthian columns supported Gothic arches which framed
Thermian heat-sculptures which displayed Reticular two-dimensional
frescoes which were illuminated by Bloom bioluminescence. The effect was
overwhelming, cacophonous, and magnificent -- a visual argument that
beauty was not a property of style but of abundance, and that the
appropriate response to having experienced every aesthetic tradition in
the history of the cosmos was to cram them all into one room and let
them fight it out.

Lord Crystalline arrived (teleportation, of course; travel was a charming
anachronism that no one at the End of Time practiced except as
performance art) and was immediately struck by the quality of the
costumes. The Final Beings had outdone themselves.

Lady Margoleth of the Perpetual Dusk swept past in the form of a
Crystalline Entity -- not the Lord's own species, which was a common
confusion, but the actual Crystalline Entities: vast, geometric
intelligences composed of pure information matrices who had inhabited
the spaces between galaxies and whose philosophical debates, conducted
at the speed of light across intergalactic distances, had taken millions
of years to resolve and had, upon resolution, immediately spawned new
debates of even greater complexity. Lady Margoleth had captured their
essential quality perfectly: she glittered with data, each facet of her
crystalline form encoding a different theorem, and when she moved, the
theorems shifted, proving and disproving themselves in an endless logical
cascade.

The Honorable Festoon, who in their default state resembled a cloud of
golden fog, had come as a specimen of the Singing Stones of Arcturus VII
-- a mineral intelligence that had achieved consciousness through the
resonant vibration of its own crystal lattice and had communicated
exclusively through music, each mineral phrase a combination of pitch,
duration, and harmonic structure that encoded meaning in dimensions that
no biological intelligence had ever fully decoded. Festoon hummed as they
drifted through the ballroom, their mineral disguise producing tones that
reverberated in the spaces between the other guests' atoms.

Count Somnambulis had, with characteristic wit, come as a Black Hole
Civilization -- one of those legendary cultures that had retreated behind
event horizons in the late epochs of the stellar age, taking their
entire population into the gravity well of a supermassive singularity
and, presumably, continuing to exist in some form on the other side,
though what form that might be was a question that even the Final Beings
could not answer, since information that crosses an event horizon tends
to stay crossed. The Count's costume was a sphere of absolute darkness,
a region of space from which no light escaped, and the other guests gave
it a wide berth, not because they feared gravitational effects -- physics
at the End of Time was a matter of etiquette rather than law -- but
because the darkness was genuinely unsettling, a reminder that even at
the End of Time, there were places from which there was no return.

Lord Crystalline circulated. He exchanged pleasantries with a guest
dressed as a Von Neumann Swarm (a cloud of self-replicating nanobots
that had once consumed an entire dwarf galaxy before achieving sentience
and, appalled by what they had done, spending the next billion years
trying to put it back). He admired a rendering of the Dream Weavers of
Andromeda (a telepathic civilization that had existed entirely within the
shared dreamspace of its members and whose "buildings" were recurring
nightmares and whose "art" was lucid dreaming elevated to the level of
cosmic architecture). He debated the authenticity of a Temporal
Hegemony costume with a guest who claimed to have actually *been* a
member of the Temporal Hegemony, which was plausible, since the Temporal
Hegemony's defining characteristic had been their ability to exist in
multiple time periods simultaneously, and being here at the End of
Time while also being there at the Height of Time was exactly the sort
of thing they would have done.

It was all very pleasant, in the way that things at the End of Time were
pleasant: beautiful, elaborate, technically perfect, and faintly, almost
imperceptibly, hollow. The costumes were superb. The ballroom was
magnificent. The wine was, as always, philosophical. But there was a
quality to the evening -- a quality that Lord Crystalline could not
quite identify -- that was different from the usual round of parties
and salons and elaborate diversions with which the Final Beings
occupied their infinite existence. Something was off. Something was
wrong. Something was *interesting*, and at the End of Time, interesting
was the rarest and most dangerous thing of all.

The newcomer arrived at precisely the wrong moment, which is to say
precisely the right moment.

The ballroom had settled into the comfortable hum of a party in full
swing -- guests mingling, music playing (composed by the ballroom itself,
a generative score that drew from every musical tradition in history and
blended them into a single, continuous, impossibly complex symphony),
conversations spiraling through topics that ranged from the merely cosmic
to the genuinely metaphysical. Lord Crystalline was discussing the
aesthetic merits of stellar collapse with Lady Margoleth when the
doors -- which were three hundred meters tall and carved from a single
piece of crystalized spacetime -- swung open, and a figure entered that
stopped every conversation in the room.

It was small. That was the first thing Lord Crystalline noticed. At the
End of Time, bodies tended toward the grandiose -- most of the Final
Beings maintained physical forms that were, by the standards of the
extinct biological civilizations, absurdly large, because scale was one
of the few remaining sources of aesthetic novelty. The newcomer was no
taller than two meters. Its body was bilateral, symmetrical, organic
in appearance -- a soft, vulnerable-looking arrangement of flesh and
bone, with two arms, two legs, a central torso, and a head crowned
with dark, fibrous material that might have been hair.

It was dressed simply. A dark garment covered the torso and legs. The
feet were encased in coverings of treated animal skin. The face -- and
it was a face, with two forward-facing eyes and a mouth and all the
usual biological apparatus of expression -- was uncovered, unadorned,
and wore an expression that Lord Crystalline could not immediately
categorize.

A whisper passed through the ballroom like a wave. Lord Crystalline
caught fragments: *What is it? Who invited it? What civilization is
that meant to represent?*

The newcomer walked to the center of the ballroom. It moved with an
economy of motion that was, in its own way, elegant -- no wasted
movement, no flourish, just the simple mechanical process of bipedal
locomotion, one foot in front of the other, the body swaying slightly
with each step in a rhythm that suggested the pull of gravity on a
creature that had evolved in a gravitational field.

It stopped. It looked around the ballroom, at the impossible
architecture and the impossible guests and the impossible music, and
its expression -- that uncategorizable expression -- resolved into
something that Lord Crystalline recognized, with a start, as wonder.

"Excuse me," said Lady Margoleth, approaching the newcomer with the
cautious curiosity of a being who has not been genuinely surprised in
approximately forty billion years. "Your costume is remarkable. I don't
recognize the civilization. Would you be so kind as to identify it?"

The newcomer looked at her. Its eyes -- small, dark, biological, wet
with a fluid that might have been tears or might have been a natural
lubricant -- focused on her crystalline form with an intensity that was
almost physical.

"I'm a human being," it said. Its voice was produced mechanically, by
the vibration of membranes in its throat, and the sound was rough and
warm and strangely moving, like the sound of wind through grass. "I've
come as Humanity."

Silence. Not the companionable silence of a party in a lull, but the
absolute, ringing silence of a room full of immortal beings who have
just heard something impossible.

"Humanity," said Lord Crystalline, speaking into the silence because
someone had to and because, of all the Final Beings, he had the longest
memory. "You've come as Humanity."

"Yes."

"That is... a very interesting choice."

"Is it?"

Lord Crystalline looked around the ballroom. The other guests had drawn
back -- not in fear, exactly, but in something adjacent to fear,
something that the Final Beings had not felt in so long that they had
forgotten the word for it. Unease. Disquiet. The sense that something
is happening that should not be happening and that the consequences are
unknowable.

"Humanity," Lord Crystalline said slowly, "was not a costume. Humanity
was real."

The newcomer tilted its head -- a gesture that communicated curiosity,
or confusion, or perhaps a mixture of both. "I know," it said. "That's
why I chose it."

"You don't understand. All the costumes here tonight represent extinct
civilizations. The Opalescent Hegemony, the Crystalline Entities, the
Singing Stones -- they are gone. They existed, and then they ended, and
now they are memories. We dress as them to honor them, to remember them,
to -- " He paused. "To play at being them, because play is all we have
left. But Humanity was never catalogued as an extinct civilization.
Humanity was..." He stopped again, because the next word was one that
the Final Beings did not use. It was a word from the old times, from
the time before entropy was reversed, from the time when things still
changed and ended and began. The word was: "Humanity was alive."

The ballroom erupted. Not in sound -- the Final Beings were too composed
for mere sound -- but in a cascade of electromagnetic communication, a
storm of data exchanged at light-speed between every guest in the room,
a billion years of experience and knowledge brought to bear on a single
question: *Was Humanity real?*

The answer, when it came, was not unanimous. The Final Beings had
different memories. Lord Crystalline remembered Humanity as a biological
civilization of extraordinary vitality and appalling brevity, a species
that had burned through the stages of cosmic development in an eyeblink
and then -- what? He could not remember. His memory, which was otherwise
perfect, contained a gap, a lacuna, a space where the ending of
Humanity's story should have been. The Opalescents had been absorbed by
the Drift. The Crystalline Entities had dissolved into pure mathematics.
The Singing Stones had fallen silent. Every civilization had an ending.
But Humanity's ending was not in his memory. It was not in anyone's
memory. It was, impossibly, missing.

"You see the problem," the newcomer said, and now its expression was
unmistakable: it was smiling. A human smile. A curve of flesh that
communicated warmth and knowledge and, underneath both, something that
Lord Crystalline had not seen in any face for longer than he could
calculate: mischief. "You remember every civilization that ever existed.
You remember how they began and how they ended. You remember the
Thermians and the Reticulum and the Bloom and a million others. But you
don't remember what happened to Humanity. And that bothers you."

"It doesn't bother me," said Lord Crystalline, who was bothered.

"It should. Because there are only two possible explanations. Either
Humanity ended and you've forgotten -- which would be the first time any
of you has ever forgotten anything, the first failure of memory in the
history of beings who exist specifically to remember -- or Humanity
didn't end. And if Humanity didn't end, then I am not wearing a costume."

The silence returned. It was deeper this time, heavier, laden with the
weight of implications that the Final Beings were only beginning to
process. Because the newcomer was right. The costumes in this room
represented the dead. That was the game. That was the point. You dressed
as a civilization that no longer existed, and in doing so, you honored
it, you remembered it, you kept it alive in the only way that things
could be kept alive at the End of Time -- through the loving, elaborate
pretense of beings who had nothing left to do but pretend.

But if Humanity was still alive -- if the newcomer was not a Final Being
playing dress-up but an actual, living, breathing human being -- then
the game had changed. Then this was not a masquerade but an encounter.
Not memory but presence. Not the echo of a civilization but the
civilization itself, walking into the ballroom at the End of Time with
two legs and dark hair and wet eyes and a smile that contained something
that no Final Being had felt in forty billion years.

"What are you?" Lord Crystalline asked, and the question was stripped of
all artifice, all performance, all the elaborate courtesies of beings
who have infinity to fill. It was, for the first time in longer than he
could remember, a genuine question. "What are you really?"

The newcomer looked at him. Its eyes -- human eyes, evolved to detect
a narrow sliver of the electromagnetic spectrum, laughably limited,
preposterously fragile -- held a depth that his own eyes, which could
perceive the full breadth of reality across all spectra and dimensions,
could not match.

"I'm what happens," the newcomer said, "when a species is too stubborn
to end. When the universe says 'your time is up' and the species says
'no, thank you, we'll stay a bit longer.' When every other civilization
accepts its ending gracefully, beautifully, with dignity and philosophy
and a lovely parting gift for the cosmos, and one -- just one -- digs
in its heels and refuses. Not because it's powerful enough to resist
entropy. Not because it's wise enough to reverse it, the way you did.
But because it is constitutionally, genetically, culturally incapable
of admitting that anything is over. You reversed entropy through
mastery. We survived it through sheer, bloody-minded denial. And here
we are."

"Here you are," Lord Crystalline repeated. "At the End of Time."

"At the End of Time. Still here. Still going."

"That is not possible. The stellar epoch ended thirty billion years ago.
The last natural stars burned out. The last habitable worlds froze.
Every biological civilization that did not transcend its substrate was
extinguished by the simple, implacable mathematics of thermodynamics.
No biological species could have survived that transition. The energy
requirements alone--"

"Would you like to hear how we did it?" The newcomer's smile widened.
It was, Lord Crystalline thought, a smile that did not belong at the End
of Time. It was too vital. Too alive. Too full of something that the
Final Beings had eliminated from their existence along with entropy and
death and the tiresome business of change. "We cheated. We broke rules.
We jury-rigged solutions out of inadequate materials and held them
together with optimism and string. When our sun expanded, we moved our
planet. When our planet froze, we tunneled underground and heated
ourselves with the decay of our own radioactive waste. When the last
stars died, we built artificial ones -- clumsy, inefficient, barely
functional, a child's drawing of a star compared to the real thing --
and we huddled around them and told each other stories to keep the dark
at bay. We are not elegant. We are not efficient. We are not wise. We
are *stubborn*. And stubbornness, it turns out, is the one quality that
the universe cannot outlast."

"You should have ended," Lord Crystalline said, and there was something
in his voice that he did not recognize -- a roughness, an edge, an
emotion that had no name in the vocabulary of beings for whom emotions
were decorative rather than functional. "Every other biological
civilization ended. The Thermians lasted eight billion years and then
dispersed gracefully into the cosmic radiation. The Bloom covered a
galaxy and then, when the galaxy began to die, let go, photon by photon,
with a serenity that was the most beautiful thing I have ever witnessed.
They understood that endings are part of the pattern. They accepted it.
Why didn't you?"

"Because we're not very good at accepting things," the newcomer said.
"We're good at complaining about things. We're good at arguing about
things. We're good at looking at the way things are and saying: no,
actually, I think they should be different. The Thermians and the Bloom
were wise. They saw the shape of the universe and found it beautiful
and let it carry them where it would. We saw the shape of the universe
and found it unacceptable and set about trying to change it with nothing
but our hands and our mathematics and our absolutely unwarranted
conviction that the universe owed us one more day."

A murmur passed through the assembled Final Beings -- not electromagnetic
this time but something older, something that the concept of
electromagnetic communication had been invented to replace: actual sound,
vibrations in the atmospheric medium of the ballroom, produced by bodies
that had not made sound in eons. It was a murmur of recognition. Because
what the newcomer was describing -- the refusal to accept, the insistence
on change, the stubborn, irrational, magnificent belief that things could
be otherwise -- was something the Final Beings dimly remembered. They had
felt it once, long ago, before they had transcended the need for feeling.
They had felt it when they were young, when entropy was still a threat
and death was still a certainty and the universe was still a place where
things could change. They had felt it, and they had solved it, and in
solving it they had lost it, and they had not known, until this moment,
that losing it was a kind of death more final than the death they had
conquered.

"Still stubbornly, gloriously, absurdly alive," the newcomer continued.
"Not because we solved death -- we didn't. We still die. Every one of
us, eventually, after a long time or a short time or a middling time.
But we keep having children. We keep building things. We keep singing
and arguing and falling in love and making terrible mistakes and
occasionally, just occasionally, making something beautiful. We are the
civilization that wouldn't sit down. And we heard you were having a
party."

Lord Crystalline looked at the newcomer, and for the first time in
forty billion years, he did not know what to say. The ballroom was
silent. The music had stopped. The Final Beings, in all their glory
and grandeur, in their costumes of extinct civilizations and their
bodies of voluntary matter and their minds that encompassed the entire
history of the cosmos, stood and stared at a small, soft, mortal
creature that should not have existed and that smiled at them with an
expression that they had forgotten the name of, and the name of the
expression was *hope*, and it was the most terrifying thing that any
of them had ever seen.

Because hope, at the End of Time, was an impossibility. Hope required
a future. Hope required the possibility of change. And the Final Beings
had neither. They had reversed entropy, yes. They had conquered death,
yes. They had achieved a state of permanent, unchanging, luxurious
existence that would persist for eternity. But in doing so, they had
eliminated the one thing that made existence bearable: the possibility
that tomorrow might be different from today.

And here was a creature -- fragile, temporary, doomed -- that still had
that possibility. That still believed in it. That carried it in its wet
eyes and its warm voice and its stubborn, ridiculous, magnificent
refusal to accept that the story was over.

Lady Margoleth spoke first. "If you are real," she said, and her
crystalline form pulsed with data that, for the first time in her
existence, she could not fully process, "if you are truly a human being
and not a costume, then you are the most frightening thing in this
room. More frightening than the Count's black hole. More frightening
than the void behind any event horizon. Because you are proof that
something can persist without perfection. That something can endure
without transcending. That the mess and muddle of biological life --
the pain, the grief, the appalling inefficiency of it all -- can
outlast the clean, eternal, flawless stasis that we chose instead."

"I know," the newcomer said. "That's what makes it funny."

"Funny?"

"Hilarious. The most powerful beings in the universe, the conquerors of
entropy itself, undone by a monkey with delusions of grandeur. You have
to admit, from a certain angle, it's comedy."

Count Somnambulis's sphere of darkness pulsed -- whether with indignation
or with something that might have been laughter, no one could tell.
Festoon hummed a note that resolved, unexpectedly, into a chord that
contained, somewhere in its harmonics, the suggestion of amusement. And
Lord Crystalline felt his Opalescent costume -- the overlapping planes
of polarized light, the crown of frozen photons, the sash of woven
darkness -- felt all of it grow suddenly heavy, suddenly false, suddenly
ridiculous in a way that it had never been before, because the being
in front of him was wearing nothing but its own skin and it was more
real than anything in the room.

"Would you like to dance?" the newcomer asked.

Lord Crystalline, who had not danced in thirty billion years because
dancing required a partner who might surprise you and nothing had
surprised him in thirty billion years, looked at this small, strange,
impossible being, and felt something stir in the ancient architecture
of his consciousness -- something old, something buried, something that
he had thought was dead but that turned out to have been merely sleeping,
waiting, the way only something very patient and very stubborn can wait,
for a hand to reach out and an invitation to be extended and a voice
to say: would you like to dance?

"Yes," he said. "I believe I would."

The music resumed. It was different now -- not the generative, all-
encompassing symphony of every tradition in cosmic history, but
something simpler, something rougher, something that came from a single
planet orbiting a single star in an unfashionable corner of a
mid-range galaxy. A waltz. Three-four time. Strings and woodwinds and
the faintest suggestion of a piano, playing a melody that was beautiful
not because it was perfect but because it was imperfect, because it
stumbled and recovered and stumbled again and kept going, because it
was the music of a species that had never done anything gracefully but
had done everything passionately, a species that had built its
civilizations on a foundation of failure and its art on a foundation of
longing and its survival on a foundation of the absolute, bone-deep,
unshakable conviction that giving up was not an option.

Lord Crystalline took the newcomer's hand. It was warm. It was mortal.
It was alive.

They danced.

And one by one, the Final Beings set down their costumes -- the
Opalescent crowns, the Crystalline facets, the Singing Stone harmonics,
all the elaborate disguises of all the extinct civilizations they had
been pretending to be -- and they joined the dance, and the Ballroom at
the Edge of Entropy was, for the first time in its existence, full of
beings who were not pretending to be something they were not but were
simply, uncomplicatedly, present, moving together to a music that was
as old as hope and as new as the moment and as stubborn, as gloriously,
absurdly, magnificently stubborn, as the small, fragile, impossible
species that had composed it.

The party lasted, by some accounts, forever.

By others, it was just getting started.

============================================================================

                       ABOUT THE AUTHORS

============================================================================

HARRISON BLACKWOOD makes his third appearance in these pages with "The
House Between the Stars," his most ambitious work to date. A former
merchant seaman who turned to writing after a bout of malaria left him
bedridden for three months in a Singapore hospital, Blackwood has
developed a devoted following for his brand of cosmic horror. He cites
Lovecraft, Machen, and Blackwood (no relation, he insists, though we have
our doubts about Algernon) as primary influences. He lives alone in a
lighthouse off the coast of Maine and claims to do his best writing
during nor'easters. His first novel, THE DARK BETWEEN, is forthcoming
from Meridian Publishing Company in spring 1954.

LUCIAN MARSH is the pen name of a practicing physician whose identity we
are sworn to protect, though we can reveal that he (or she) works in a
major metropolitan hospital and draws heavily on medical knowledge for
stories that have appeared in WEIRD TALES, ASTOUNDING, and now our own
humble pages. "Hollow Astronaut" is the first of what Marsh promises
will be a series of stories exploring "the body as alien landscape."
We received the manuscript in a plain brown envelope with no return
address, which seems appropriate for a writer whose work makes the inside
of the human body feel like the most foreign territory in the universe.

THEODORE CAIN is a regular contributor to these pages and a favorite of
our readers, known for his ability to balance humor with genuine menace.
A former agricultural extension agent in Iowa (which may explain his
affinity for stories about farming on alien worlds), Cain now writes
full-time from his home in Cedar Rapids, where he lives with his wife
Margaret, their four children, and a dog named Bradbury. "Jack O'Lantern
Junction" grew, he tells us, from a childhood memory of carving pumpkins
with his grandfather and the unsettling realization that the pumpkin
seemed to be watching him back.

ARTHUR WAINWRIGHT spent twenty-two years as an engineer at General
Electric before retiring to write fiction. His stories reflect his
background: methodical, precisely observed, and grounded in the real
mechanics of how things work. "The Ghost in the Machine" is his first
published story, and we are proud to introduce him. He tells us he wrote
it in a single sitting after visiting a former colleague's automated
factory and feeling, for the first time, as though the machines
recognized him. He lives in Schenectady, New York, with his wife Eleanor
and describes his writing process as "debugging the human condition."

AGNES WHITFIELD is, in this editor's estimation, one of the most
important new voices in science fiction. A veteran of the Women's Army
Corps who served as a cryptographer during the war, Whitfield brings a
spare, devastating precision to her prose that strips away sentiment
without sacrificing feeling. "Things Undone" is her fourth story for us
and her most powerful. She lives in Washington, D.C., works for an
agency she is not at liberty to name, and writes, she says, "because
some things can only be said in fiction, and some fiction can only be
written by people who know what it means to watch things fall apart."

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY is the closest thing this magazine has to a house
writer, having appeared in eight of our ten issues. A former Navy radio
operator who spent the war listening for enemy transmissions in the
South Pacific, Finley brings an authenticity to his communications-
themed stories that no amount of research could replicate. "The Witching
Frequency" is classic Finley: fast, sharp, and built around a conceit
so elegant that you don't see the twist until it's too late. He lives in
San Diego with his wife Ruth, operates a ham radio from his garage, and
insists that the strangest things he's ever heard on the airwaves are
things he cannot print in a family magazine.

OSCAR LENNOX is a mystery. He (we assume he) has published exactly four
stories, all in this magazine, each one more strange and brilliant than
the last. He has no known address, no telephone number, and no biography
beyond what can be inferred from his prose, which suggests a classical
education, an extensive knowledge of cosmology, and a sense of humor
that operates at altitudes where the air is very thin. "Masquerade at
the End of Time" arrived at our office typed on paper of a quality we
have never seen before, accompanied by a note that read: "For the
Halloween issue. I trust the timing is appropriate." We trust it is.

                   Letters from Our Readers

============================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading Issue #9 and I am compelled to write
regarding Agnes Whitfield's story "The Last Cartographer." I am a
forty-three-year-old schoolteacher in Omaha, Nebraska, and I have
read science fiction since I was old enough to hold a pulp magazine, and
I tell you without exaggeration that Miss Whitfield's story is the
finest piece of writing I have encountered in any genre in the past
decade. The final paragraph -- I won't spoil it for those who haven't
read it -- made me set down the magazine and stare at the wall for
twenty minutes. My husband asked if I was all right. I told him I was
better than all right. I was changed. Please publish more of her work.
As much as you can get. As fast as she can write it.

                    -- Mrs. Doris Painter, Omaha, Nebraska

[Editor's note: Ask and ye shall receive, Mrs. Painter. Miss Whitfield's
"Things Undone" appears in this very issue. We share your estimation of
her talents.]

Dear Editor,

With respect, I must take issue with the scientific accuracy of
Theodore Cain's "The Red Harvest" in your September number. Mr. Cain
describes a planet with a 400-day orbital period orbiting a G-type star
at a distance of 1.3 AU, but a simple application of Kepler's Third Law
demonstrates that such an orbit would require approximately 541 days, not
400. I realize that this is fiction, but if we do not hold our fiction to
the standards of actual science, what distinguishes us from the readers
of AMAZING STORIES?

                    -- Prof. Harold Kessler, Dept. of Astronomy,
                       University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan

[Editor's note: Professor Kessler is, of course, correct. We have
forwarded his letter to Mr. Cain, who replies: "Tell the Professor he's
absolutely right, and if he'd like to come help me harvest bioluminescent
gourds on a planet where the math works out better, he's welcome to the
trip." We at TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND are committed to scientific
accuracy and grateful to readers who keep us honest.]

---

Dear Tales from the Future,

I am twelve years old and I have been reading your magazine since
Issue #1. My father says I am too young for some of the stories but my
mother says I am exactly the right age and they argue about it every
month when the new issue arrives. I like the scary ones best. My favorite
story so far is "The Stars Are Wrong" by Harrison Blackwood from Issue #5.
It gave me nightmares for a week and I loved every minute of it. For the
Halloween issue, please make the stories as scary as possible. I want
nightmares that last a MONTH.

                    -- Tommy Wojcik, age 12, Chicago, Illinois

[Editor's note: Tommy, we have done our best. Please convey our
apologies to your father in advance.]

---

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I write to commend Robert Finley's consistently excellent work and to
ask: is there any truth to the rumor that Meridian Publishing Company plans to collect
his stories in a single volume? Several of us at the San Francisco
Science Fiction Society would very much like to have his work in a
permanent edition, particularly "Signal and Noise" from Issue #3, which
we consider a masterpiece of the form.

                    -- Leonard Hong, President, San Francisco
                       Science Fiction Society

[Editor's note: Mr. Hong, I am pleased to confirm that a Finley
collection is indeed in the works, tentatively titled VOICES FROM THE
VOID, scheduled for publication in early 1954. Watch this space for
further details.]

---

Dear Sirs,

Your magazine is trash and an insult to literature. I picked up a copy
at my barber's and read two stories and felt my intelligence actively
diminishing with each page. Spaceships! Ray guns! Monsters from beyond
the stars! This is entertainment for children and the feeble-minded. I
suggest you abandon this juvenile enterprise and devote your talents, such
as they are, to something of genuine literary merit.

                    -- Name withheld by request, Boston, Massachusetts

[Editor's note: We appreciate all correspondence, even correspondence
that arrives, as this one did, on the back of a subscription renewal
form. We look forward to continuing to diminish your intelligence on a
monthly basis.]

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW

                  Reviews by Frances Greer

============================================================================

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clarke
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

It is a rare thing when a science fiction novel makes one feel genuinely
small, and I mean this as the highest possible compliment. Clarke's
latest -- and greatest -- work imagines the arrival of benevolent alien
"Overlords" who bring peace to Earth at the cost of humanity's autonomy,
and then reveals, with devastating patience, that peace was never the
point. The final chapters, which I will not describe except to say that
they concern the evolution of humanity's children into something
unrecognizable and the consequent end of the species as we know it, are
among the most awe-inspiring and heartbreaking passages I have read in
any literature, genre or otherwise. Clarke writes with a clarity that
makes the impossible seem not merely plausible but inevitable, and the
emotional weight of his conclusion -- the image of the last human on an
empty Earth, watching the stars -- will stay with me for a very long
time. Essential reading. If you buy one book this year, buy this one.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $2.75)

Sturgeon's fix-up novel, assembled from the novelettes "Baby Is Three"
and its companion pieces, is a work of such compassion and strangeness
that it defies easy categorization. The premise -- a group of misfit
humans who together form a composite being greater than the sum of its
parts -- is pure science fiction, but Sturgeon's treatment is anything
but formulaic. His prose is lyrical, his characters are wounded and real,
and his central argument -- that the next stage of human evolution will
be not individual but collective, not a superman but a superorganism
built from the broken and the unwanted -- is both scientifically
intriguing and deeply humane. The novel's emotional climax, in which the
composite being must choose between power and conscience, is as morally
serious as anything in mainstream fiction. Sturgeon has long been one of
the field's finest stylists; with MORE THAN HUMAN, he proves himself
one of its finest thinkers as well.

FAHRENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

Bradbury's expansion of his earlier novella "The Fireman" arrives at a
moment when its subject -- the burning of books by a future government
that has decided knowledge is dangerous -- feels less like extrapolation
than prophecy. The novel is uneven; Bradbury's gift for poetic imagery
sometimes overwhelms his narrative momentum, and the third act rushes
toward its conclusion with a haste that feels out of character for so
meditative a writer. But the core of the book -- Guy Montag's awakening
to the value of the written word in a society that has chosen to destroy
it -- is powerful and urgent and written with a passion that burns
(forgive the pun) on every page. The scene in which Montag reads Dover
Beach aloud to his wife's horrified friends is worth the price of
admission alone. Not Bradbury's best work -- that remains THE MARTIAN
CHRONICLES -- but an important one, and a timely one, and a book that
deserves to be read before someone decides to burn it.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS

              A Preview of Issue #11 -- November 1953

============================================================================

Next month, TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND returns with a very special
issue devoted to the theme of FIRST CONTACT -- stories of humanity's
initial encounters with alien intelligence, from the terrifying to the
transcendent.

Featured stories will include:

"AMBASSADOR'S TONGUE" by Oscar Lennox -- When Earth's first
ambassador to an alien civilization discovers that the aliens'
language is literally untranslatable -- not because the words are
unknown but because the concepts don't exist in human thought -- she
must find a way to communicate without communication. A story about
the limits of understanding and the bridge that exists beyond them.

"HANDSHAKE" by Theodore Cain -- A farmer in rural Kansas has been
leaving food on his back porch for what he assumes is a stray dog.
It isn't a dog. It isn't from Kansas. And it has learned to shake hands.
Classic Cain: funny, warm, and more profound than it has any right to be.

"THE WEIGHT OF LIGHT" by Agnes Whitfield -- An astronomer receives a
signal from a dying star. The signal is a story. The story is about her.
Whitfield at her spare, devastating best.

Also: Harrison Blackwood returns with a tale of cosmic horror set in a
library that contains every book ever written -- including one that hasn't
been written yet. Robert Finley brings us a locked-room mystery aboard a
generation ship. And Arthur Wainwright investigates what happens when a
computer achieves consciousness and its first act is to file a complaint
with management.

Plus: the return of our popular Science Fact column with a special
report on the latest developments in radio astronomy, letters from our
readers, and reviews of the season's most significant new books.

Issue #11 will be on newsstands November 5th.

Don't miss it.
