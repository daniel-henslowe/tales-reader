TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

Summer is upon us, and with it comes the third annual Summer Spectacular
— the biggest issue of the year, packed with seven stories of the kind
that made you fall in love with science fiction in the first place. This
is our issue for long afternoons on the porch, for road trips and beach
blankets, for reading past midnight because you absolutely must find out
what happens next. If you have ever dreamed of strange horizons, this
issue is for you.

We begin with what I believe to be Rex Drummond's finest story. "The
Corsair of the Crimson Nebula" is space opera on the grandest scale — a
full novella of fleet actions, alien mysteries, and a captain who may be
the most vivid character Drummond has ever put on the page. Captain Zara
Cole is tough, clever, reckless, and utterly alive, and the Crimson
Nebula itself is one of those settings that burns itself into the
imagination. This story has been in preparation for months, and I can
tell you that Drummond poured everything he had into it. I think you
will agree it shows.

Douglas Pemberton follows with a comedy that is, beneath its
impeccable wit, a rather profound meditation on the nature of creation
and the absurdity of ownership. Theodore Cain delivers one of his
tightest, most harrowing stories — a moral crucible from which there is
no easy escape. Margaret Thornton gives us a tale of terraforming gone
beautifully, terrifyingly wrong. Gunnar Eriksson takes us to the
farthest edge of human settlement for a story of solitude, duty, and
a decision that could change the course of history. Bob Finley offers
a story that surprised me: warm, funny, and unexpectedly moving.
And Lucian Marsh closes the issue with the kind of creeping,
atmospheric dread at which he is unmatched.

Seven stories, seven extraordinary writers, one spectacular issue.
This is what summer reading should be.

One further note. Our first Summer Spectacular (Issue #6, June 1953) was
a gamble — we were barely six months old, and a double-sized issue
seemed like madness. But you responded with enthusiasm, and the Summer
Spectacular has become our most anticipated annual tradition. This year's
issue is our biggest and, I believe, our best. Thank you for making it
possible.

Now turn the page, settle into your chair, and let these seven stories
carry you to places you have never been.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                    ZARA COLE AND THE CRIMSON NEBULA

                          by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

                               I.

The Crimson Nebula was the biggest damn thing Captain Zara Cole had ever
seen, and she had seen plenty.

It hung in the viewscreen like a wound in the sky — a vast, swirling
curtain of gas and dust that stretched across thirty light-years of
space, glowing the deep angry red of a sunset on a world where the sun
had decided it had had enough of going down politely. Stars were born
in that cloud. Stars died in it. And somewhere in its heart, if the
stories were true, the alien dreadnought Kethara drifted in silence,
carrying a weapon that could end every war humanity had ever fought or
ever would fight.

Cole stood on the bridge of the Starhammer with her boots planted wide
and her hands locked behind her back and stared at the nebula like a
woman deciding whether to pick a fight with God.

"That," said Briggs from the navigation console, "is a lot of red."

"Thank you, Briggs. Your gift for observation continues to astound."

"I'm just saying, Captain. Charts don't cover what's in there. Magnetic
fields'll tear our nav systems apart inside of twenty minutes. We'll be
flying blind."

"We'll be flying by instinct, Mr. Briggs. Which is how I've been flying
since I was seventeen years old and stole my daddy's cargo skiff on
Callisto."

"You were sixteen, Captain. You've told the story."

"I've improved the story. There's a difference."

She turned from the viewscreen and looked at her bridge crew — all seven
of them, which was four more than the Starhammer technically needed and
three fewer than any sane captain would want for what they were about
to do. Briggs at navigation, solid and perpetually worried, the kind
of man who checked his calculations three times and then worried he
had miscounted. Vasquez at weapons, lean and quiet, with the cold eyes
of a woman who had killed before and filed it under "necessary." Dr.
Okafor at the science station, the only member of the crew with a
degree from an actual university, which he brought up approximately
once per hour. Young Tommy Park at communications, nineteen years old
and so eager it made Cole's teeth ache. And the others — Hendricks at
engineering, Yamoto at the helm, Cho at the sensor arrays — all of
them looking at the Crimson Nebula on the viewscreen with expressions
that ranged from professional concern to naked terror.

Good. Naked terror was the appropriate response.

"All right," Cole said. "Listen up. Here's the situation, and I'll only
say it once because I don't like repeating myself and you don't like
hearing it."

She walked to the tactical display and punched up the fleet overview.
Seventeen ships glowed green against the black — seventeen ships out of
the thirty-one that had set out from Arcturus Station six weeks ago.
The others had peeled off, one by one, as the mission went from
ambitious to dangerous to probably suicidal. Desertion, mechanical
failure, cold feet, and one spectacular mutiny aboard the Defiant that
had ended with Captain Vasil locked in his own brig and his ship
limping back to port.

Seventeen ships. Eighteen hundred souls. And a nebula that wanted to
eat them.

"The Kethara is in there," Cole said, pointing at the swirling red mass
on the display. "Intelligence says deep — two, maybe three days' travel
at sublight speeds. The nebula's too dense for jump drives. Too much
electromagnetic interference for long-range sensors. We go in dark. We
navigate by visual reference and short-range sweep. We stay in
formation, we watch each other's backs, and we find the ship."

"And if it doesn't want to be found?" asked Dr. Okafor.

"Everything wants to be found, Doctor. Otherwise what's the point of
existing?"

"That's philosophy, Captain, not tactics."

"In my experience, they're the same thing."

She grinned — that wide, reckless grin that had made half her crew love
her and the other half consider transferring to a safer posting, like a
munitions barge.

"We enter the nebula at 0600 ship time. Formation: diamond spread,
three-hundred-kilometer intervals. The Starhammer takes point. Any
captain who wants to drop out can do so now — no hard feelings, no
questions asked. But once we go in, we go in together, and nobody
leaves until we find what we came for."

She looked around the bridge. Nobody spoke. She hadn't expected them to.

"Get some sleep," she said. "Tomorrow we go hunting."

                              II.

Nobody slept.

Cole certainly didn't. She lay on her bunk in her cabin and stared at
the ceiling and listened to the low thrum of the Starhammer's engines
and thought about the Kethara, as she had been thinking about it for
three years — ever since she had heard the story from a dying alien in
a bar on Procyon IV.

The alien had been a Keth — one of the last of them, a species that had
once commanded an empire spanning half the galaxy and had then, for
reasons no one fully understood, simply stopped. Stopped expanding.
Stopped conquering. Stopped, eventually, doing much of anything at all.
They drifted through human space now as traders, diplomats, and
occasionally bar companions, their enormous amber eyes carrying the
weight of a civilization that had looked at the universe and decided it
had seen enough.

This particular Keth had been dying of something that translated roughly
as "cosmic fatigue" — his species' poetic term for the organ failure
that came at the end of their thousand-year lifespans. He sat at the
bar drinking a luminous blue liquor that smelled of ozone and sadness,
and he told Zara Cole about the Kethara.

"It was the last great ship," he said, his translator rendering his
whistling speech into a gentle baritone. "The final command vessel of
the Keth Ascendancy. When we decided to stop, the admirals who would
not stop took the Kethara into the Crimson Nebula and were never seen
again."

"What was the weapon?" Cole asked.

The Keth had looked at her with those enormous amber eyes, and for a
moment she had seen something in them that might have been amusement
or might have been infinite pity.

"The weapon," he said, "is understanding."

Then he finished his drink and died, right there at the bar, with a
grace and economy that Cole admired on a professional level.

Understanding. That was the kind of answer that drove a practical woman
crazy. But Cole had done her research. She had tracked down every
reference to the Kethara in every library, archive, and dockside rumor
mill between here and the galactic core. And what she had found,
pieced together from fragments and legends and the coded logs of Keth
navigators, was this: the Kethara carried a device that could project
a field of absolute empathy across interstellar distances. Anyone
caught in the field would experience the suffering of every being
within its range — every wound, every grief, every lonely death. The
Keth had built it as a weapon of last resort, the ultimate deterrent
against aggression. And then they had used it on themselves, and the
experience had been so overwhelming that an entire civilization had
simply... stopped.

Cole wanted that weapon. Not to use it — she wasn't crazy. But to have
it, to control it, to hold it over the heads of every admiral and
warlord and colonial governor who had ever decided that war was a
reasonable solution to a political disagreement. The threat alone would
be enough. No one would fight if fighting meant feeling every bullet
from both sides.

It was the most ambitious plan she had ever conceived, and she had
conceived some ambitious plans. It was also, she was fairly certain,
going to get a lot of people killed.

She lay on her bunk and stared at the ceiling and did not sleep.

                             III.

They entered the Crimson Nebula at 0600 sharp, and within the first
hour, three things happened.

First, the nebula closed around the fleet like a fist. The viewscreen
went from the star-scattered black of normal space to a deep, churning
red that pressed against the ship's hull like something alive. Visibility
dropped to a hundred kilometers, then fifty, then twenty. The gas was
denser than the charts had suggested — much denser — and it seemed to
pulse with a slow, irregular rhythm that Dr. Okafor described as
"almost biological" and Vasquez described as "creepy as hell."

Second, the navigation systems failed. Not gradually, not in stages,
but all at once, as though someone had thrown a switch. Briggs stared
at his console, then looked up at Cole with the expression of a man
who has just been told his parachute is decorative.

"Captain, I have no fix on our position. No stellar references. The
nebula's absorbing everything — radio, optical, even the gravimetric
beacons. We're—"

"Blind," Cole said. "We discussed this, Mr. Briggs."

"Discussing it and experiencing it are different things, Captain."

"Welcome to my life."

Third — and this was the part that made Cole's skin crawl — something
moved in the gas.

It was fast and it was big and it was gone before the sensors could get
a lock on it. A shadow, slipping through the red murk like a shark
through bloody water. Tommy Park caught a sensor ghost — a mass reading
that suggested something roughly the size of a destroyer, but the
reading made no sense because destroyers didn't undulate.

"Contact," Park said, his voice climbing half an octave. "Bearing
two-seven-zero, range fifteen kilometers, closing — no. It's gone."

"Classification?" Cole asked.

"Unknown, Captain. It wasn't... I mean, it didn't look like a ship."

"Describe what it looked like, Mr. Park."

The boy swallowed. "It looked like something swimming."

Cole stared at the viewscreen. The red gas churned and swirled and
showed her nothing.

"Attention all ships," she said into the fleet channel. "Be advised we
have indigenous fauna. Keep your shields hot and your weapons ready but
do not — repeat, do not — fire unless fired upon. We don't know what
these things are, and I'd rather not start a fight with the local
wildlife before lunch."

The fleet acknowledged, seventeen voices tight with tension. Cole
settled deeper into her command chair and watched the nebula.

The nebula watched back.

                              IV.

By the end of the first day, they had lost two ships.

The Reliant went first, at 1400 hours. She was a converted ore hauler
on the fleet's starboard flank, slow and heavily armored, commanded by
a retired naval officer named Kapoor who had joined Cole's expedition
because he was bored in retirement and missed having something to shoot
at. He never got the chance. The nebula creatures — and by now it was
clear there were creatures, plural, many of them, circling the fleet
like wolves around a campfire — came at the Reliant from below. The
ship's sensors registered a sudden massive contact, then a sound that
the Reliant's communications officer later described as "a can opener
the size of a building," and then the Reliant's signal cut out.

Cole ordered the nearest ship, the Ventura, to investigate. The Ventura
found debris. The Reliant had been opened along her ventral seam as
neatly as a surgeon opening a chest cavity, and whatever had opened her
had done it with claws or teeth or something that left marks in hull
plating two inches thick.

"Biological," Dr. Okafor said, studying the sensor readings with the
detached fascination of a man who would rather be studying from further
away. "The creature — or creatures — appear to be silicon-based
organisms that have adapted to the nebular environment. They feed on
the heavy metals in the gas clouds, and I suspect they regard our ships
as... well..."

"Lunch," Vasquez said.

"I was going to say 'mineral deposits,' but yes. Lunch."

The Valiant went three hours later. She was a fast courier ship,
running ahead of the formation to scout, and she flew straight into
an ambush. Two of the creatures hit her simultaneously from opposite
sides, and the Valiant folded like a beer can in a fist. There were
no survivors.

Cole stood on the bridge of the Starhammer and listened to the distress
calls fade to static and felt something cold settle in her chest. Not
fear — she had been afraid before and knew the taste of it. This was
responsibility. Thirty-seven people dead because of her plan, her
ambition, her conviction that one woman and a ragtag fleet could change
the galaxy.

"Captain," Briggs said quietly. "Several of the other ships are
requesting a conference."

"I bet they are."

"Captain Okonkwo of the Thunderbolt is using the word 'mutiny'
liberally."

"Put them on."

The fleet conference lasted forty minutes. Five captains wanted to turn
back. Three wanted to push forward. The rest wanted Cole to tell them
what to do, which was what they always wanted and what she had always
provided.

"We push forward," Cole said. "We adapt. We learn how these creatures
hunt, and we stop being prey. The Kethara is in here somewhere, and I
am going to find it."

"You're going to get us all killed," said Okonkwo.

"That's possible," Cole said. "But I'm going to find it first."

She cut the channel before anyone could respond. It was not, she
reflected, her most diplomatic moment. But diplomacy was for people
who had time to be polite, and time was something the fleet did not
have in abundance.

"Vasquez," she said. "Tell me about these creatures."

"Big. Fast. They hunt in pairs. They come from below and behind."

"So we stop giving them a below and behind. Reconfigure the fleet.
Sphere formation, tight intervals. Put the armed ships on the outside,
the civilian hulls in the center. And rig every external light we've
got to full intensity. If these things live in the dark, let's see how
they feel about the light."

"That will drain our power reserves—"

"I know what it will drain, Vasquez. Do it."

It worked. Sort of. The sphere formation and the lights kept the
creatures at bay — they circled at the edges of visibility, vast
shadows slipping through the red gas, but they did not attack. The
fleet crept deeper into the nebula, a tiny sphere of white light in an
ocean of crimson darkness, and the creatures followed, and waited.

They were patient. Zara Cole, as a general rule, was not.

                               V.

On the second day, they found the graveyard.

It appeared out of the murk without warning — a field of wreckage that
stretched in every direction as far as the sensors could reach. Ships.
Hundreds of them. Thousands. Vessels of every design and origin, from
sleek Keth warships to crude, bolted-together hulks that looked like
they predated spaceflight as a concept. They hung motionless in the
gas, their hulls breached, their lights dead, their interiors open to
the void. Some were ancient — so old that their metal had begun to
crystallize, crumbling at the edges like old bread. Others were merely
decades old, their paint still recognizable, their markings still
legible.

"My God," Briggs whispered.

Cole said nothing. She walked to the viewscreen and pressed her hand
against the glass and looked at the dead ships and understood, with a
clarity that hit her like a punch, that she was not the first person to
come looking for the Kethara. She was not the hundredth. She was merely
the latest in a long, long line of captains who had chased the same
legend into the same red darkness and found the same ending.

"How many?" she asked quietly.

"Difficult to estimate," Dr. Okafor said. "The field extends beyond
sensor range. But based on density and extrapolation... thousands of
vessels. Tens of thousands of crew. Over centuries."

"All looking for the Kethara?"

"The distribution pattern suggests so. They came from multiple
directions, over a long period of time, and they all ended up here."

"The creatures got them?"

"Some, certainly. But many of these wrecks show no signs of biological
attack. They simply... stopped. Power failure. Life support failure.
Systems shutting down one by one."

"The nebula drained them," Hendricks said from engineering. "Captain,
I've been monitoring our power output. We're losing energy at a rate
about twelve percent above what the nebula density accounts for.
Something in here is sapping our systems. Slowly, but steadily."

"How long until it's critical?"

"At current rate? Eighteen hours."

Cole closed her eyes. Eighteen hours. The Kethara could be five minutes
away or five days away, and she had eighteen hours before her fleet
became another layer in the graveyard.

She opened her eyes and looked at the dead ships and made her decision.

"All ahead full," she said. "Maximum speed. We stop being careful and
we start being fast. Scatter the fleet — every ship on its own heading,
maximum sensor sweep. First ship to find the Kethara signals the rest."

"That breaks the formation," Vasquez said. "The creatures—"

"The creatures are the least of our problems now. Move."

                              VI.

The Starhammer punched through the graveyard at full thrust, weaving
between the hulks of dead ships, and the creatures came.

They came from everywhere — above, below, from within the wrecks
themselves, rising like eels from the gutted carcasses of ships they
had presumably killed and settled into like hermit crabs. They were
enormous, and in the glare of the Starhammer's lights, Cole finally
saw them clearly: vast, sinuous bodies armored in plates of crystallized
silicon, mouths that were simply holes ringed with metallic teeth, eyes
— dozens of eyes — that glowed a faint, hungry amber.

"Vasquez!"

"Firing."

The Starhammer's guns lit up the nebula. Pulse cannons, plasma
batteries, the big forward railgun that could punch through a cruiser's
hull at two hundred kilometers. The creatures screamed — a sound that
came through the hull itself, a vibration that Cole felt in her chest
and her teeth and the soles of her boots — and some of them died, and
more of them came.

The fleet scattered. Ships peeled off in every direction, their lights
blazing, their weapons firing, and the creatures pursued them through
the red murk in a chaos of light and shadow and screaming metal. Cole
watched ships die on the tactical display — blips going orange, going
red, going dark — and she kept her eyes forward and her jaw set and she
drove the Starhammer deeper.

"Contact!" Tommy Park shouted. "Bearing dead ahead, range forty
kilometers. Massive metallic signature. It's... Captain, it's
enormous."

"The Kethara?"

"It matches the profile. It's — Captain, it's the biggest ship I've
ever seen."

"Then let's go say hello."

The Starhammer burst through a curtain of red gas, and there it was.

The Kethara.

It hung in a clearing in the nebula — a pocket of relatively thin gas
where the stars were almost visible, as if the nebula itself had
pulled back in deference. The ship was two kilometers long, sleek and
organic in design, its hull the deep green-black of a beetle's wing.
It was intact. It was lit from within, a pale amber glow that spilled
from a thousand windows. And it was, after all these centuries, still
alive.

"I'm getting power readings," Hendricks said. "Enormous power readings.
That ship is running at full capacity."

"Hail them," Cole said.

Park's hands were shaking, but his voice was steady. "Kethara vessel,
this is Captain Zara Cole of the Starhammer, representing the
Independent Fleet out of Arcturus Station. We come in peace and request
permission to approach."

Silence.

"Again," Cole said.

Park repeated the hail. Silence again. Then—

The Kethara's hull rippled. That was the only word for it. A wave
passed across the ship's surface, from bow to stern, and in its wake,
a section of hull simply opened, like a mouth, revealing a cavernous
docking bay lit by that same amber glow.

"I believe," Dr. Okafor said carefully, "that we have been invited in."

Cole grinned. "Then it would be rude to decline."

She brought the Starhammer in.

                             VII.

The interior of the Kethara was like nothing Cole had ever seen — and
she had been in alien vessels before, plenty of them, from the cramped
crystal warrens of Drossian trade ships to the cathedral-scale Venn
habitats. But the Kethara was different. The Kethara was alive.

The walls breathed. The floors pulsed with a slow, rhythmic warmth.
The air smelled of ozone and something organic, something green and
growing, and everywhere Cole looked she saw not metal and circuitry
but smooth, curving surfaces that grew into each other like the
branches of trees, like coral, like the inside of a living body.

"Bio-organic architecture," Dr. Okafor said, running his scanner over
a wall that flexed gently at his touch. "The ship is grown, not built.
The entire structure is a single organism — or at the very least, a
symbiotic colony of organisms functioning as one."

"Is it dangerous?" Vasquez asked, her hand on her sidearm.

"It's a spaceship, Vasquez. Of course it's dangerous."

Cole led the landing party — herself, Okafor, Vasquez, and Park —
through corridors that curved and branched like arteries. The amber
light came from the walls themselves, a bioluminescence that brightened
as they approached and dimmed after they passed, as if the ship were
watching them and lighting their way. The deeper they went, the warmer
it became, and the pulse in the floor grew stronger, more regular, like
a heartbeat.

"Captain," Park said. "I'm picking up life signs ahead. Multiple
contacts. Keth biosignature."

"How many?"

"Hundreds."

Cole stopped walking. She looked at Vasquez, who looked back with those
cold, professional eyes that said: I am ready for whatever comes next.

"Weapons down," Cole said. "We came to talk."

"Captain—"

"Weapons down, Vasquez. That's an order."

They entered a chamber that was the size of a cathedral and shaped like
the inside of an egg. The walls were alive with light — not the amber
glow of the corridors but a shifting, shimmering display of colors
that moved in patterns too complex and too beautiful for Cole to
process. And in the center of the chamber, seated in concentric rings
on structures that had grown from the floor like mushrooms, were the
Keth.

Hundreds of them. Perhaps a thousand. They were tall and graceful, their
skin the color of old ivory, their enormous amber eyes fixed on Cole
with an expression she could not read but which did not, she noted with
relief, appear to be hostile.

One of them rose. She was ancient — the oldest living thing Cole had
ever seen, her skin translucent, her eyes dimmed to a soft gold. She
moved with a liquid grace that belied her apparent fragility, and she
crossed the chamber to stand before Cole and looked at her for a long
moment in silence.

"You found us," the Keth said, her translator rendering the words in a
voice like wind through crystal. "You all find us, eventually. The
ambitious ones. The ones who believe they can change the nature of
conflict."

"Then you know why I'm here," Cole said.

"Yes. You want the weapon."

"I want to end war."

The ancient Keth made a sound that might have been laughter. "So did
we. Come. Let me show you what you came for."

                            VIII.

The weapon was a room.

It was the heart of the ship — literally, as far as Cole could
determine, the central organ around which the living vessel had grown.
A spherical chamber, thirty meters across, lined with membranes that
pulsed with light and trembled with sound beyond the range of human
hearing. In the center, suspended in a web of bio-organic filaments,
hung a shape that Cole's brain could not quite resolve — something that
was simultaneously a machine, an organism, and a thought made physical.

"Resonance Engine," the ancient Keth said. "When activated, it
broadcasts on every frequency of consciousness within its range. Every
mind, every nervous system, every entity capable of suffering —
connected. Feeling what all others feel. The pain of the wounded, the
grief of the bereaved, the terror of the dying. Simultaneously."

"And it works," Cole said. It was not a question.

"It works. We activated it once, at the height of our civil war. The
range encompassed seven star systems. Twelve billion Keth experienced
each other's agony in a single moment."

"And the war stopped."

"The war stopped. Everything stopped. How do you wage war when you feel
your enemy's pain as your own? How do you fire a weapon when you will
experience the wound it inflicts? We tried. We could not. No one can."

Cole stared at the Resonance Engine and felt her heart hammering. This
was it. This was what she had crossed the galaxy for, what she had lost
ships and people for. The ultimate deterrent. The weapon to end all
weapons.

"But?" she said, because there was always a but.

The ancient Keth looked at her with those dimmed amber eyes, and Cole
saw in them a sorrow so vast and so old that it made the nebula itself
seem small.

"But empathy on that scale is not a switch you can turn off. The
connections linger. The feelings persist. You do not merely experience
the suffering of others in the moment — you carry it. Every death,
every loss, every small cruelty, every heartbreak across seven star
systems, felt as if it were your own. The war ended. But so did
everything else. Art. Ambition. Joy. How can you celebrate when
you feel the grief of strangers? How can you build when you feel
every injury the building might cause? We could not bear the weight
of universal empathy, Captain. No species can. It is simply too much."

"So you came here," Cole said. "You brought the ship into the nebula
and you... hid."

"We came here to wait. To find, slowly, over centuries, the boundaries
of self that the Engine dissolved. To learn how to feel for others
without being destroyed by it. Some of us have succeeded. Most have
not." She gestured at the rings of silent Keth. "They are still
connected. Still feeling. They sit, and they endure, and they wait for
the weight to become bearable."

"Centuries," Cole whispered.

"Centuries. The weapon works, Captain Cole. It ends war absolutely and
without exception. But it does not end suffering. It distributes it.
And distributed suffering, we learned, is not halved. It is
multiplied."

Cole stood in the heart of the living ship and looked at the Resonance
Engine and felt the full, crushing weight of what she was being told.
She had come for a weapon to end war, and she had found one. It worked
perfectly. And it was the worst thing she had ever encountered.

"I can't take this back," she said.

"No."

"I can't use it."

"No."

"Then what was the point?" The words came out harder than she intended,
edged with the grief of a woman watching her life's purpose dissolve.
"Why does it exist? Why did you build it?"

"We built it because we could. We used it because we thought we should.
We hid it because we learned what it cost. And now you are here, and
you must decide what to do with the knowledge of its existence."

Cole was quiet for a long time. Resonance Engine pulsed in its web
of filaments, and the chamber breathed around her, and somewhere outside
the hull the creatures of the nebula circled in the red dark.

"The creatures," she said suddenly. "The nebula predators. You control
them?"

"They are the ship's immune system," the ancient Keth said. "Guardians.
They destroy those who come seeking the weapon with violence in their
hearts."

"I had violence in my heart."

"You had ambition in your heart. And hope. The creatures can tell the
difference."

Cole looked at the old alien for a long moment, and then she did
something that surprised even herself. She laughed. It was not a
happy laugh, but it was genuine — the laugh of a woman who has
traveled to the edge of the possible and found, waiting for her,
the punchline to a cosmic joke.

"You've been waiting," she said. "Not just recovering. Waiting.
For someone to come who would understand."

"Yes."

"And you've been sending them away. Everyone who comes. For centuries.
Telling them the same story, showing them the same machine, watching
them reach the same conclusion."

"Yes."

"Why not destroy it?"

The ancient Keth tilted her head. "Could you destroy the only weapon
that can end war, Captain? Even knowing what it costs? Could you
remove that option from the universe forever?"

And there it was. The real question. The one that would keep Cole
awake for the rest of her life, the same way it had kept the Keth
awake for centuries.

She turned to her crew. Park was pale. Okafor was scribbling in his
notebook with the intensity of a man trying to get everything down.
Vasquez was watching the Keth with narrowed eyes, calculating, always
calculating.

"We're leaving," Cole said.

"Captain?" Park said.

"We're leaving. We're going back to the fleet, we're getting out of
this nebula, and we're going home."

"And the weapon?" Vasquez asked.

"Stays here. Where it belongs."

"And the story?"

Cole looked at the ancient Keth one last time. The old alien's eyes
were very bright.

"We tell the story," Cole said. "We tell everyone what's in here — what
it does and what it costs. We let them know it exists, and we let them
know why it can never be used. And maybe — maybe — that knowledge
alone changes something. Not because people feel each other's pain.
Because they choose to imagine it."

The ancient Keth bowed. It was a gesture of such profound grace that
Cole felt her throat tighten.

"You are the first," the Keth said, "to reach that answer."

"I doubt I'll be the last."

"No. But you are the first. And that matters."

                              IX.

They left the Kethara as the ship's hull closed behind them like a
wound healing. The nebula creatures escorted the Starhammer back to
the fleet — not attacking, but guiding, their enormous bodies
luminous in the red gas, their movements almost gentle.

Seven ships had survived. Seven out of seventeen. Cole gathered the
fleet and led them out of the Crimson Nebula, navigating by instinct
and the strange, unaccountable sense that the nebula was letting them
go. They emerged into clear space on the third day, and the stars
spread out before them like a promise, and Briggs wept at his console
and Cole let him because there were some things that deserved tears.

"Captain," Park said, as the fleet reformed and set course for
Arcturus. "What do we tell them? When we get back?"

Cole thought about the ancient Keth sitting in their rings, carrying
the weight of seven star systems. She thought about the Resonance
Engine, pulsing in the dark. She thought about all the captains who
had come before her, who had seen the same thing and made the same
choice — or different choices, worse choices, choices that had ended
in the graveyard.

"We tell them the truth," she said. "That the weapon exists. That it
works. That it costs everything. And that the only real weapon against
war is the decision not to wage it."

"That's not very satisfying, Captain."

"No, Mr. Park. It isn't. But it's what we've got."

She settled into her command chair and watched the stars, and behind
her, the Crimson Nebula glowed like a coal in the dark — vast, patient,
and keeping its secrets for the next captain brave enough or foolish
enough to come looking for the answer to the oldest question in the
universe.

And Zara Cole, who had seen plenty, thought that she had finally seen
enough.

================================================================================

                  PATENT ON THE UNIVERSE

                        by Douglas Pemberton

================================================================================

                               I.

It is a truth universally acknowledged by bureaucrats that the universe,
however vast and mysterious it may be, is considerably less so once you
have filed the proper paperwork.

Cedric Pennywhistle held this truth to be self-evident. He had held it
to be self-evident for the past nine thousand, four hundred and
seventeen years — or, if one preferred the more conventional reckoning,
since approximately half an hour after the Big Bang, adjusted for
temporal inflation and tea breaks. Cedric's memory on this point was
somewhat hazy, as the first few millennia of existence tend to blur
together in much the same way that the first few days of a new job do,
but he was reasonably certain that he had been filing patents since
before the invention of fire, and he had the carbon-dated rubber stamps
to prove it.

He was, by title, the Senior Patents Examiner of the Bureau of
Intellectual Property (Temporal Division), which was housed in a
building at the absolute last moment of time — a location selected
not for its scenic qualities, which were negligible (the universe
outside the windows was a uniform grey, all the stars having long
since burned out), but for its jurisdictional convenience. A patent
office at the end of time could receive applications from every era
simultaneously, which was efficient, and could adjudicate priority
disputes by simply looking up when a thing had actually been invented,
which was definitive.

The building itself was a masterpiece of terminal-era architecture: a
vast, echoing structure of imperishable crystal that would, according
to the architects, survive the heat death of the universe by a
comfortable margin — an assurance that Cedric found professionally
reassuring and personally bleak, as it meant his employment was, in
the most literal sense imaginable, guaranteed for eternity.

On the morning in question — and mornings at the end of time were
strictly a matter of convention, there being no sun to rise — Cedric
arrived at his desk to find the usual assortment of patent applications
waiting in his pneumatic intake.

The first was a claim, submitted from the year 2,847 BCE, for a device
described as "a pointed stick, but better." Cedric examined the
attached diagrams, consulted the Comprehensive Registry of Pointed
Sticks (a document of surprising length), and determined that the
applicant's innovation — a slight curve in the sharpened end — had
been anticipated by a Homo erectus artisan approximately 1.2 million
years earlier. He stamped the application DENIED (PRIOR ART) and
placed it in the rejection chute with the practiced efficiency of a
man who had denied applications for pointed sticks before and fully
expected to deny applications for pointed sticks again.

The second application, from the forty-third century, claimed patent
protection for a device that could transmit human consciousness across
interstellar distances. Cedric reviewed it with rather more interest —
consciousness transmission was always a lively area of patent law —
but was obliged to deny it on the grounds that the Centaurians had
achieved functionally identical results some eighty thousand years
prior using an organic neural network that the applicant had clearly
reverse-engineered. The applicant would doubtless appeal. They always
did.

The third application claimed patent protection for the wheel. Cedric
sighed. This happened at least once a week. He stamped it DENIED
(PRIOR ART — SEE ALSO: EVERY CIVILIZATION EVER) and made a mental
note to update the office's FAQ document, which already devoted
fourteen pages to explaining why you could not patent the wheel.

The fourth application was from a being who identified himself as "God,
or reasonable facsimile thereof," and claimed patent protection for the
universe itself.

Cedric read the application twice. Then he removed his spectacles,
polished them on his cardigan, replaced them, and read it a third
time. The wording was clear, the forms were correctly filled out (in
triplicate, as required), and the filing fee had been paid in full
(in a currency that Cedric did not recognize but which the Bureau's
omnitemporal exchange calculator accepted without complaint).

The application stated, in the calm, declarative prose of someone
who has nothing to prove:

"I, the undersigned, hereby claim original invention and sole
authorship of the following: the universe, in its entirety, including
but not limited to all matter, energy, space, time, physical laws,
constants, and emergent phenomena therefrom, filed herewith as
Patent Application No. ∞-1. Supporting documentation: the universe
itself. Prior art: none."

Cedric placed the application on his desk, aligned it precisely with
the desk's edge — he was a man who found comfort in right angles —
and reached for his tea. The tea was cold. It was always cold. The
thermodynamic situation at the end of time did not favor hot beverages.

"Well," he said aloud to his empty office. "This is irregular."

                              II.

The applicant was waiting in Reception Hall 7, which was the hall
reserved for entities of indeterminate ontological status — a category
that included time travelers who had not yet been born, artificial
intelligences that had been retroactively erased, and the occasional
philosophical concept that had achieved sufficient complexity to fill
out a form. The hall was furnished with chairs designed to accommodate
the broadest possible range of morphologies, which meant they were
comfortable for no one.

Cedric found the applicant seated in one of these chairs, reading a
magazine. The magazine was titled "The Patent Examiner's Quarterly,"
which was published by Cedric's office and had a circulation of one.

The applicant was, in appearance, a small, mild-looking person of no
particular age, wearing a grey suit of no particular cut, with a face
of no particular distinction. The overall effect was of someone who
had decided to look like everyone and no one simultaneously — the
platonic ideal of a person waiting in a government office.

"Mr., Mrs., or other designation... God?" Cedric asked, consulting
his clipboard.

"Just God is fine," the applicant said. "No honorific necessary. I find
titles rather pretentious, coming from someone who created the concept
of hierarchy."

"Quite. Well. Shall we discuss your application?"

"By all means."

Cedric settled into the chair opposite and opened his file. "I must
begin by noting that your application is, if I may say so, somewhat
unusual."

"I should hope so. I only made the one universe."

"Yes. Well. That is, in fact, the crux of the matter. You claim to
have invented the universe."

"I did invent the universe."

"All of it?"

"Every particle, wave, and awkward silence. I'm particularly proud of
the octopus."

Cedric made a note. "And you can provide proof of this claim?"

The applicant gestured broadly. "You're sitting in it."

"I beg your pardon?"

"The proof. The universe. You're in it. Rather hard to bring a working
model to the office, so I left it running. I trust you've noticed it?
Large thing, mostly dark, expanding in all directions?"

Cedric conceded that he had, in fact, noticed the universe. It was
rather difficult to miss.

"The difficulty," he said, steering the conversation back to
procedural grounds, "is one of verification. We require independent
confirmation that you are, in fact, the originator of the invention
claimed. In most patent cases, this is established through
documentation — laboratory notebooks, prototype records, witness
testimony. In your case—"

"In my case there were no witnesses, on account of there being no one
else in existence at the time. Rather a chicken-and-egg problem, I
grant you, except that I also invented the chicken and the egg, and I
can tell you definitively that the egg came first, though I admit the
chicken had better publicity."

"You see the difficulty."

"I see the difficulty, and I sympathize with it. Bureaucracy is one
of my less inspired inventions. I was having an off eon."

Cedric, who had devoted his entire existence to bureaucracy, chose
not to take this personally. "I shall need to consult precedent," he
said. "And my supervisor."

"You don't have a supervisor."

"I beg your pardon?"

"You don't have a supervisor. You've been working alone in this office
for nine thousand years. You invented the supervisor to have someone
to blame when you needed to delay a decision."

This was, Cedric had to admit, entirely accurate. The supervisor —
a Mrs. Agatha Grindleford, whose office was perpetually "just down
the hall" and who was perpetually "in a meeting" — was a convenient
fiction that Cedric had maintained for millennia. No one had ever
called his bluff.

"Be that as it may," Cedric said, recovering, "the application raises
unprecedented questions that require deliberation."

"Take all the time you need," the applicant said. "I've got eternity.
I should know — I invented it."

                             III.

Cedric retreated to his office and did what he always did when
confronted with a genuinely novel problem: he consulted the
Comprehensive Registry.

The Registry was the Bureau's master file — a document of nearly
infinite length that catalogued every patent ever granted, denied,
or pending, from the first flaked stone tool to the last quantum
computer. It existed in a state of perpetual self-updating, receiving
applications from every era simultaneously and cross-referencing
them against each other with a speed and thoroughness that would
have been impressive if anyone other than Cedric had been paying
attention.

He searched for prior art.

The universe, as an invention, had no prior art. This was axiomatic:
if you invented the universe, there was, by definition, nothing before
you. The Registry confirmed this with a terse notation: "No prior
entries found. Category: unprecedented."

He searched for competing claims.

This was more productive. Over the centuries, seventeen different
entities had filed patent claims on the universe or significant
portions thereof. A committee of quantum physicists from the
eighty-ninth century had claimed collective authorship of the physical
laws. A corporation called OmniGen Ltd. had attempted to patent all
organic life as a "designed biological system." A philosopher from
ancient Athens had filed a claim on the concept of reality itself,
though his application had been written on a napkin and lacked the
required fee.

All had been denied. But none of them had claimed to be the actual
creator of the thing claimed.

Cedric stared at his files and thought.

The problem, he reflected, was not whether the applicant's claim was
true — the Patent Office did not, as a rule, concern itself with
truth, which was the province of philosophy and religion. The problem
was whether the applicant had met the legal requirements for a patent.
These were four in number: novelty, non-obviousness, utility, and
sufficient documentation.

Novelty: the universe was, to the best of anyone's knowledge, unique.
Check.

Non-obviousness: the universe was, by any standard, not an obvious
invention. One could argue that the specific configuration of physical
constants that permitted the existence of stars, planets, and patent
offices was so improbable as to constitute a work of extraordinary
creative genius. Check.

Utility: the universe was, Cedric supposed, useful. People lived in
it. Things happened in it. Patent offices operated in it. Its utility
was perhaps debatable in a cosmic sense — what was the universe for? —
but the Bureau did not require metaphysical justification, only
practical application, and the universe had plenty of that. Check.

Sufficient documentation: here was the sticking point. The applicant
had provided no laboratory notebooks, no design specifications, no
prototype records. The applicant's position was that the universe
itself constituted sufficient documentation, which was either
brilliantly self-evident or flagrantly circular, and Cedric could
not determine which.

He was still pondering this when the door to his office opened and a
second entity entered — this one tall, angular, and dressed in the
black robes of the Supreme Court of Eternity.

"Pennywhistle," the entity said. "We need to talk."

                              IV.

The entity's name was Justice Aeternus Blackstone, and he was the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court of Eternity — a body that existed, like
the Patent Office, at the end of time, and which served as the final
court of appeal for all legal matters in all eras. Justice Blackstone
was, in Cedric's experience, the most humorless entity in existence,
which was saying something in a universe that contained tax accountants
and German opera.

"I understand," Justice Blackstone said, settling his angular frame
into a chair and fixing Cedric with eyes that had seen every legal
brief ever written and had found them all wanting, "that you have
received a patent application from an entity claiming to be God."

"The entity claims to be God and claims to have invented the universe.
These are, I should note, two separate claims, only the second of
which falls within my jurisdiction."

"The Court disagrees. If the patent is granted, it establishes legal
authorship of the universe, which implies ownership, which implies the
right to alter, license, or discontinue the product in question. The
implications are, you will agree, not trivial."

Cedric agreed that they were not trivial. The right to discontinue
the universe was, even by the Patent Office's generous standards,
a somewhat consequential entitlement.

"The Court has therefore decided to take jurisdiction," Justice
Blackstone said. "The matter will be heard before a full panel.
You will serve as Examiner of Record — presenting the technical
merits of the application. The applicant will argue his own case.
I will invite opposing counsel from the accumulated civilizations of
history."

"Opposing counsel?"

"If someone claims to own the universe, Pennywhistle, the rest of us
have standing to object."

This was, Cedric reflected, a fair point.

The trial of the universe was held three days later (by convention;
time, at the end of time, being more of a courtesy than a physical
phenomenon) in the Grand Courtroom of the Supreme Court of Eternity,
which was an amphitheater of imperishable crystal that seated ten
thousand and was, for this occasion, full.

The assembled beings represented every civilization, every era, every
form of intelligent life that had ever existed in the universe whose
ownership was under dispute. They ranged from the primordial —
sentient gas clouds from the universe's first billion years, who
communicated in gravitational waves — to the terminal — abstract
intelligences from the final eras, who existed as pure information
and regarded physical form as a quaint affectation. Between these
extremes sat humans, Keth, Centaurians, Drossians, Venn, and ten
thousand other species, all of them with opinions and most of them
with lawyers.

The applicant — God, or reasonable facsimile thereof — sat at the
plaintiff's table, still wearing the grey suit, still looking like
everyone and no one, and reading a crossword puzzle.

Justice Blackstone called the court to order.

"The matter before this Court," he said, "is Patent Application
Number Infinity-Dash-One, filed by the entity styling itself 'God,'
claiming original invention and sole authorship of the universe.
The applicant will present his case."

God put down the crossword puzzle and stood.

"Thank you, Your Honor. I'll keep this brief. I made the universe.
I made the quarks, the leptons, the four fundamental forces, and the
tax code, though I apologize for the last one. I made the physical
constants exactly as they are because those are the values that produce
interesting results — by which I mean stars, planets, life, and the
capacity for suffering that makes joy meaningful and vice versa. I did
not file a patent at the time because the Patent Office did not yet
exist, on account of I hadn't invented bureaucracy yet. I'm filing now
because Mr. Pennywhistle's office has finally caught up with my
backlog, and I believe in following proper channels."

"And your proof?" Justice Blackstone asked.

"My proof is that the universe works. It is elegant, self-consistent,
and has been running without significant maintenance for approximately
fourteen billion years. I would like to see anyone else in this room
achieve comparable uptime."

A murmur ran through the amphitheater. Several of the sentient gas
clouds vibrated in what may have been applause.

Opposing counsel rose. She was a human woman from the forty-first
century — a constitutional scholar named Dr. Amara Osei, who had been
selected to represent the interests of all created beings on the
grounds that she was brilliant, fearless, and had once successfully
argued a case against the concept of entropy.

"If it please the Court," Dr. Osei said, "the applicant's claim
raises a fundamental question. A patent grants the holder exclusive
rights to their invention. If this patent is granted, the applicant
would own the universe — and by extension, everything and everyone
in it. We would all, in a legal sense, become the property of the
patent holder."

The murmur became a roar. Several of the abstract intelligences
flickered in agitation. A delegation of Keth rose to their feet and
whistled in protest.

"Furthermore," Dr. Osei continued, "the applicant claims to have
created suffering — his own words — as a deliberate design feature.
If so, I submit that the invention fails the utility requirement.
An invention that causes harm to its users is defective by design,
and a defective invention is not patentable."

"Objection," God said mildly. "I also created joy, beauty, love,
music, the taste of ripe fruit, and the feeling you get when a dog
is happy to see you. I would ask the Court to consider the whole
product."

"The whole product includes death," Dr. Osei said.

"The whole product includes what comes after death, which I haven't
spoiled and don't intend to."

The courtroom erupted. Justice Blackstone banged his gavel for
seventeen consecutive minutes.

                               V.

The trial lasted, by the Court's reckoning, eleven days. Cedric, as
Examiner of Record, presented his technical analysis: the universe
met the criteria of novelty and non-obviousness; utility and
documentation were in dispute. Witnesses were called from across
history — physicists who described the elegance of the physical laws,
philosophers who questioned whether elegance implied authorship,
theologians who had been waiting for exactly this moment and were not
about to let it pass without extensive commentary.

The applicant remained unflappable throughout, answering questions
with a patience that was either divine or pathological, and
occasionally making the courtroom laugh — which, Cedric noted,
even Justice Blackstone did once, though he immediately apologized
to the record.

On the final day, God made his closing argument.

"I don't need a patent," he said. "The universe runs without one. It
ran before the concept of intellectual property existed, and it will
run after the concept has been forgotten. I filed this application
because I wanted to see what you would do with it — all of you, every
species, every mind. I wanted to see if you could sit in a room
together and argue about who owns reality without killing each other.
And you did. For eleven days, ten thousand civilizations talked instead
of fought. You disagreed passionately and you did not reach for
weapons. That, I submit, is the real invention. That is the product.
The universe is just the venue."

He sat down. The courtroom was very quiet.

Justice Blackstone retired to deliberate. He returned thirty seconds
later, which was the fastest deliberation in the Court's history.

"The patent is denied," he said, "on the grounds that the universe,
if created, was created for the use of its inhabitants, and an
invention made for others cannot be owned by one alone. The applicant
is, however, commended for the elegance of his design and the quality
of his filing."

"I accept the ruling," God said. "Though I would note that the denial
itself proves my point. A universe that can produce beings wise enough
to tell their creator he doesn't own them is a universe worth making."

He stood, tucked the crossword puzzle under his arm, and walked out
of the courtroom.

Cedric returned to his office, sat down at his desk, and poured
himself a cup of tea. The tea was cold. He drank it anyway.

On the rejected application, in the space reserved for Examiner's
Notes, he wrote:

"Application denied. Universe remains in the public domain.
Recommend continued maintenance."

He stamped it, filed it, and reached for the next application in
his pneumatic intake. It was a claim, from the year 847 AD, for
an improved design for a pointed stick.

Cedric sighed, happily, and got back to work.

                             CRUCIBLE

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The escape pod was built for eight. There were six of them in it, and
air for five.

Hendricks figured it out first. He was the engineer — a thin, quiet
man with wire-rimmed glasses and grease under his fingernails that
twenty years of spacefaring hadn't been able to remove — and he ran
the numbers on the life support panel within the first ten minutes,
while the rest of them were still coughing from the evacuation and
trying to understand that the survey ship Aldrin was gone.

"Oxygen recycler took damage in the separation," Hendricks said. He
said it the way he said everything: flat, factual, like a man reading
a parts manifest. "It's running at eighty-three percent capacity. At
full load — six adults, current activity level — we have forty-one
hours of breathable air."

"And how far are we from the nearest station?" asked Commander Barrett.

"Beacon signal puts Outpost Seven at fifty-two hours."

Nobody spoke. The math did the talking for them.

Six people. Air for five. Fifty-two hours to safety.

Barrett looked around the pod. It was a cylinder about four meters
long and three wide, cramped with acceleration couches, supply
lockers, and the squat bulk of the life support unit that hummed
against the aft wall. The overhead light was a flat, harsh white that
made everyone look like they were already dead. There was a viewport
in the forward bulkhead, but no one was looking out of it. The stars
were not comforting just now.

"Run the numbers again," Barrett said.

"I've run them three times, Commander."

"Run them again."

Hendricks ran them again. The answer was the same. It would always
be the same.

Barrett closed his eyes. He was fifty-four years old, career military,
twenty-eight years in the survey service. He had a square face and
grey hair cropped close and the kind of steady, unremarkable competence
that got you through crises by not making them worse. He had never lost
a crew member. He had never imagined losing one like this.

"Options," he said.

"Reduce oxygen consumption," Hendricks said. "If we sedate everyone
who isn't essential for navigation and life support maintenance — deep
sedation, metabolic suppression — we can stretch the air. Maybe. The
math is tight, but it's possible."

"How many need to stay awake?"

"Two. One to navigate, one to maintain the recycler. Everyone else
goes under."

"That's four people sedated. Does the air hold for six?"

Hendricks hesitated. It was a small hesitation — a fraction of a
second — but in the silence of the pod, it was enormous.

"It holds for five," he said. "Even with four in deep sedation, six
bodies consume too much baseline oxygen. The recycler can't keep up.
We're eleven hours short."

Barrett opened his eyes. "So. Five survive."

"Five survive."

"And the sixth?"

The silence was absolute. The life support unit hummed. The stars
turned slowly in the viewport that no one was watching.

"The sixth," Hendricks said, "doesn't."

                              II.

The six of them were:

Commander James Barrett, fifty-four, mission commander. Married,
three children, stationed at Arcturus Station for the past six years.
He had been looking forward to retirement. His wife, Ellen, was
planning a house on Lake Michigan.

Dr. Lena Vasik, thirty-eight, ship's physician. Unmarried, no
children, born on a colony world and raised in the cramped corridors
of orbital stations. She was the one who had pulled them out of the
Aldrin's wreckage — small, strong, calm in a way that was either
courage or dissociation.

Frank Hendricks, forty-two, engineer. Married, two children, quiet
and competent, the kind of man who fixed things that were broken and
did not ask for credit.

Tom Brennan, twenty-six, geologist. On his first deep-space survey.
Big, red-haired, eager, the youngest person in the pod by a decade.
He had been laughing at a joke when the Aldrin hit the debris field.
He was not laughing now.

Sister Maria Consolata, sixty-one, mission chaplain. A Dominican nun
who had been assigned to the survey service by her order and who had,
in three years of service, proven herself to be the most practically
useful person on any ship she served on. She could fix a conduit,
dress a wound, and deliver a homily with equal facility.

David Chen, forty-five, navigator. Divorced, one child, a son he
hadn't seen in three years. He spoke rarely, calculated constantly,
and kept his emotions in a compartment that he opened only when he
was alone, which, in the current circumstances, he never would be
again.

Six people. Six lives. All of them complete, all of them valuable,
all of them real.

And one of them had to die.

                             III.

Barrett made the decision to draw lots. He made it quickly, before
the alternatives could take root — before someone could suggest
that age or health or dependents or usefulness should be the
criteria, because once you started measuring people against each
other, you were already in a place where civilization was just a
word.

"We draw lots," he said. "Random. Blind. One chance in six for
every person in this pod, including me. No exceptions, no
exemptions, no volunteers."

"Commander—" Brennan started.

"No volunteers, Brennan. I know what you're about to say, and I
appreciate the courage behind it, but I won't allow it. We are not
going to let a twenty-six-year-old kid sacrifice himself because he
thinks that's what heroes do. Heroes get to grow old and tell the
story. You're going to draw with the rest of us."

"What if someone refuses to accept the outcome?" Dr. Vasik asked.

The question hung in the air. Barrett looked at her.

"They accept it," he said. "Because there is no other option that
doesn't turn us into something I won't be."

Sister Maria spoke for the first time. "Commander, I want to pray
before we draw."

"Pray all you want, Sister. But the lots are random."

"I know they are, Commander. I'm not asking God to fix the draw.
I'm asking Him to give us the strength to bear it."

Barrett looked at her for a long moment, then nodded.

Sister Maria bowed her head. She did not pray aloud — she was not
the dramatic type — but her lips moved, and the silence in the pod
shifted slightly, as if a door had opened to a larger room.

"All right," Barrett said. "Hendricks, rig the draw."

Hendricks took six lengths of wire from the repair kit. He cut five
of them to identical lengths and one short. He held them in his fist
so that the tops were even, the short one invisible among the others.
His hand was steady. His face was not.

"We draw in order of rank," Barrett said. "I draw first."

He reached for the wires. His fingers closed around one. He pulled
it free.

Long.

Dr. Vasik drew. Long.

Chen drew. Long.

Sister Maria drew. Long.

Brennan drew. His hand was shaking. He pulled a wire free.

Long.

That left Hendricks, holding the last wire in his fist. He didn't
need to look at it. He opened his hand slowly and stared at the short
wire lying in his palm.

"Well," he said, in that flat, factual voice. "That settles that."

                              IV.

Nobody moved. Nobody spoke. The life support unit hummed its
indifferent hum.

Hendricks looked at the short wire for a long time. Then he looked
up at Barrett.

"I won't do it," he said.

Barrett had been waiting for this. Not wanting it, but waiting for
it, the way you wait for the second shoe to drop, the way you wait
for the thing you hoped wouldn't happen but knew would.

"Frank—"

"I won't do it, Commander. I have a wife. I have two kids. Danny's
twelve. Sarah's nine. I promised them I'd come home."

"We all promised someone, Frank."

"I don't care about everyone. I care about Danny and Sarah. I'm not
going to die in this tin can so that—" He stopped. His jaw worked.
"So that someone else gets to go home to their family."

"Nobody's family is worth more than anyone else's family," Barrett
said, keeping his voice level. "That's the point of the draw."

"Easy to say when you drew a long wire."

The words hit Barrett like a slap. Because they were true. He had
drawn a long wire, and the relief had been so vast and so shameful
that he could still feel it curdling in his stomach.

"The draw was fair," he said.

"The draw was random. Random isn't fair. Fair is when someone looks
at my life and your life and makes a judgment. I'm forty-two. I'm
an engineer. I'm the one keeping the recycler running. If I die,
who maintains the system? You?"

"I can maintain the recycler," Chen said quietly from the navigation
console. "Frank showed me the basics."

"The basics. Great. And when something breaks — really breaks — in
hour thirty-eight, and you're all breathing thin air and panicking,
who fixes it? The basics?"

Nobody answered, because the answer was no one.

Dr. Vasik spoke. "Frank, I can sedate you. You won't feel anything.
It will be like falling asleep."

"It will be like dying. Don't dress it up, Doctor."

"It is dying. I'm not dressing it up. I'm telling you it doesn't
have to hurt."

"It already hurts."

The silence came back. It was becoming a regular visitor.

Brennan stood up from his couch. He was the biggest person in the
pod — six-foot-two, broad-shouldered, with the physical ease of
someone who had never been sick a day in his life. He had been very
quiet since the draw.

"I'll take his place," Brennan said.

"No," Barrett said.

"Commander, I'm twenty-six. I'm not married. I don't have kids. I've
got a sister in Phoenix who I haven't called in six months. I'm the
least... the least tethered. If someone has to go, it should be me."

"The draw was random, Brennan. If I let you swap, the draw means
nothing. And if the draw means nothing, then we're making judgments
about whose life is worth more, and I will not do that."

"Then what?" Hendricks said. "You're going to force me?"

Barrett looked at him. "No. I'm not going to force you. I am going
to ask you, as your commanding officer and as a man who respects you,
to honor the agreement we all made when we drew."

"I didn't agree to die. I agreed to a draw. I thought I'd win."

"Everyone thought they'd win, Frank. That's the only reason the
draw works."

                               V.

The hours passed. They did not resolve anything.

Hendricks retreated to the aft section of the pod, as far from the
others as the tiny space allowed — about two meters — and sat with
his back against the life support unit and did not speak. The others
gave him space, which was a courtesy and also a relief, because being
near him was unbearable. His fear filled the pod like a smell.

Barrett sat in the command couch and stared at the overhead and
thought about what he would do if Hendricks continued to refuse. He
did not think about it abstractly. He thought about it in specific,
physical terms: the mechanics of forcing a man to die. The weight of
a body. The strength it would take. The sounds a person made.

He thought about it, and he was disgusted with himself for thinking
about it, and he thought about it some more.

Dr. Vasik came to sit beside him. She spoke quietly.

"His cortisol levels are through the roof. Heart rate elevated,
respiration fast and shallow. He's in acute stress response — fight
or flight. Except there's nowhere to fly."

"How long before he becomes a medical risk?"

"He's already a medical risk. Stress at this level, in an enclosed
space, with oxygen rationing — he could have a cardiac event.
Ironically, that might solve the problem."

"That's not funny, Doctor."

"I know it's not."

Barrett looked at her. "If I ordered you to sedate him—"

"That would be murder, Commander. Sedation in this context isn't
treatment. It's execution."

"I know what it is."

"Then you know I won't do it. My oath—"

"I know about your oath."

They sat in silence. In the aft section, Hendricks' breathing was
audible — fast, ragged, the sound of a man drowning in air that was
slowly running out.

Sister Maria crossed the pod and sat down beside Hendricks. She did
not speak. She simply sat there, her hands folded in her lap, her
presence a statement that he was not alone. After a while, Hendricks
looked at her.

"Are you here to tell me it's God's will?" he said.

"No. I'm here to sit with you."

"I don't want company."

"I know. I'm here anyway."

"Is that what they teach you in the convent? To bother people who
want to be left alone?"

"Among other things."

Despite himself, Hendricks almost smiled. It was a terrible smile —
more like a wince that had lost its way — but it was there.

"I'm afraid," he said.

"Of course you are."

"I keep thinking about Sarah. She's in fourth grade. She made me
promise to come to her science fair. She's building a model of the
solar system out of fruit."

"That sounds lovely."

"It's going to rot before the fair. I told her, use Styrofoam. She
said fruit was more realistic."

"She's right."

"She's nine."

They were quiet for a while. The life support unit hummed against
Hendricks' back.

"I don't know how to do this," Hendricks said. "I don't know how
to choose to die."

"Nobody knows how to do it," Sister Maria said. "That's not the kind
of thing you can know in advance."

"Have you made your peace? With this, I mean? If the draw had gone
the other way?"

"I've spent thirty-seven years making my peace, Frank. That's what
the religious life is: practice for the moment when everything is
taken away and you have to decide what remains."

"And what remains?"

She was quiet for a long time.

"Love," she said. "That's all. Everything else is furniture."

                              VI.

At hour nineteen, the recycler stuttered.

It was a small thing — a momentary dip in output, a flicker in the
status light — but in the enclosed world of the pod, it was seismic.
Everyone looked at Hendricks, because Hendricks was the engineer,
and the engineer was the one who could fix it.

Hendricks looked at the recycler panel. His training took over — the
deep, automatic competence of a man who had spent twenty years keeping
machines alive. His hands moved before his mind could object, checking
connections, reading diagnostics, tracing the fault.

"Secondary filter is clogging," he said. "Particulate buildup from
the hull breach debris. If it blocks completely, we lose another
eight percent capacity."

"Can you fix it?" Barrett asked.

"I can clear it. Needs to be done every six hours."

He cleared the filter. It took him four minutes. When he was done, the
recycler's hum smoothed out, and the air quality indicator ticked up
by a fraction.

Hendricks stared at his hands. They were still good hands — steady,
capable, the hands of a man who fixed things. He could feel the
competence in them like a current, and he knew, with a clarity that
he resented, that these hands might be the difference between life
and death for the other five people in this pod.

The irony was precise and cruel: the man who had to die was the man
they most needed alive.

He looked at Barrett. "If I maintain the recycler — hands-on
maintenance, not just automated — I can squeeze another three percent
out of it. Maybe four."

"Is that enough?"

"No. But it extends the timeline. We go from forty-one hours to
forty-four, maybe forty-five. Still short."

"But closer."

"Closer."

Barrett was quiet. The others were watching — Vasik, Chen, Brennan,
Sister Maria — all of them aware that something was shifting, that
the conversation had moved from abstract argument to practical
reality.

"There might be another way," Chen said from the navigation console.
His voice was careful, the voice of a man presenting calculations
he had checked and rechecked. "I've been plotting alternative courses.
There's a debris field at bearing one-seven-five — wreckage from the
Aldrin, most likely. Some of those compartments may still hold
atmosphere. If we can reach it and salvage intact oxygen tanks—"

"How far?" Barrett asked.

"Six hours out of our way. But if we find tanks, we don't need to
make the choice at all."

"And if we don't find tanks, we've burned six hours of air on
nothing."

"Yes."

Barrett looked at Hendricks. Hendricks looked at Barrett.

"It's a gamble," Barrett said.

"It's a chance," Hendricks said. "Six hours ago, I didn't have one."

"If it fails, we're in worse shape than before. The draw stands."

"If it fails, the draw stands. But let me try."

Barrett nodded. "Chen, set the course. Hendricks, keep that recycler
running. Everyone else, minimum activity. We conserve every breath."

                             VII.

The six hours were the longest any of them had ever lived.

They found the wreckage at hour twenty-six — a tumbling field of
hull fragments, supply containers, and shattered equipment from the
Aldrin's forward section. Chen brought the pod in close, and Hendricks
suited up — the pod carried two emergency EVA suits — and went outside.

He was out for ninety minutes. The others watched him through the
viewport — a small figure in a white suit, moving among the debris
with the slow, deliberate care of a man defusing a bomb. He searched
methodically, compartment by compartment, container by container,
moving through the wreckage of the ship that had been his home for
three months.

He found food rations. He found a medical kit. He found personal
belongings — a photograph, a book, a child's drawing that had been
taped to someone's bunk. He did not find oxygen tanks.

At minute eighty, he found one. It was dented, scarred, and wedged
under a collapsed bulkhead, and it took him twenty minutes to work
it free, and when he brought it back into the pod and connected it
to the recycler and checked the gauge, it was half full.

"How much does that give us?" Barrett asked.

Hendricks ran the numbers. His hands were shaking — from the EVA,
from the cold, from the adrenaline — but his math was steady.

"Fourteen hours," he said. "Fourteen hours of additional oxygen."

"And we need?"

"Eleven to reach Outpost Seven with six people breathing."

The margin was three hours. Three hours between life and death.
Three hours between a pod of six survivors and a pod of five
survivors and a body.

Hendricks sat down on the deck. He put his head in his hands. He
did not weep — he was not the type — but his shoulders shook once,
hard, as if something inside him had broken loose and was settling
into a new position.

"Thank you," Barrett said.

"Don't thank me," Hendricks said. "Thank the Aldrin. She saved us
even after she was dead."

                            VIII.

They reached Outpost Seven with forty-seven minutes of breathable
air remaining. The station's medical team was waiting — Chen had
transmitted their situation eight hours earlier — and they were
brought aboard and given oxygen and blankets and hot coffee and
the simple, overwhelming luxury of air that someone else was
responsible for.

Barrett filed his report. It was thorough and precise and left
nothing out: the failure of the Aldrin, the capacity of the pod,
the draw, Hendricks' refusal, the salvage run, the recovery. He
noted, in the dispassionate language of military documentation, that
all six crew members had survived and that no disciplinary action was
recommended for any party.

The report did not capture what had happened in the pod. No report
could. The way Hendricks had looked at the short wire. The way
Brennan had offered to take his place. The way Sister Maria had sat
in the silence and refused to leave. The way the fear had smelled,
and the way the air had tasted as it thinned, and the sound of six
people breathing in a space too small for their terror.

Hendricks went home. He flew back to Arcturus Station, and he hugged
his wife, and he went to Sarah's science fair, and the solar system
made of fruit had indeed begun to rot, and he told her it was the
most beautiful thing he had ever seen, and he meant it.

Barrett went home too. He retired, as planned. He and Ellen bought
the house on Lake Michigan. Some nights, he woke up and could not
breathe, and he would go to the window and look at the lake and take
slow, deep breaths of the thick, sweet, plentiful air, and he would
think about a pod four meters long and an engineer with a short wire
and the sound of a life support unit humming against the wall.

He never drew lots again. For anything. For the rest of his life, he
made his choices deliberately, one by one, accepting the weight of
each one, because he had learned in a pod built for eight that
randomness was not justice and that the only choices that mattered
were the ones you made with your eyes open.

The air was free. The air was everywhere. And it was never, ever
enough.

                        GREENHOUSE EFFECT

                        by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                               I.

The first sign that something had changed in Greenhouse Complex Seven
was the ferns.

Dr. Elise Nakata noticed it on a Tuesday morning in March — March by
the colonial calendar, which bore only an approximate relationship to
the actual seasons of Mars, there being no actual seasons on Mars in
any sense that a terrestrial botanist would recognize. She was making
her weekly inspection of the temperate zone biome, walking the gravel
paths between banks of engineered vegetation with her field notebook
open and her sensor wand extended, recording growth rates, soil pH,
atmospheric composition, and the thousand small measurements that kept
the greenhouse breathing.

The ferns in Section 4-C were wrong.

Not dead. Not diseased. Wrong. Their fronds had changed shape
overnight — or over several nights, she corrected herself, because
she had not inspected this section in ten days and changes in
morphology took time even in fast-growing species. The Pteridium
cultivar planted here was a standard terraforming variety: hardy,
fast-spreading, engineered for maximum oxygen output and minimum
nutrient demand. Its fronds were supposed to be broad, flat, and
triangular — maximized for photosynthetic surface area under the
full-spectrum grow lights that lined the greenhouse ceiling.

These fronds were narrow. Vertical. Angled toward the greenhouse
walls rather than the ceiling lights. And their color had shifted
from the standard bright green to a deeper, bluer shade that Elise
had never seen in this cultivar.

She knelt beside the nearest fern and examined it closely. The
cellular structure was different — she could see it without a
microscope, the tissue denser, the veins more prominent. She touched
a frond, and it was warm. Not the ambient warmth of the greenhouse,
which was maintained at twenty-two degrees Celsius. Warmer. The fern
was generating its own heat.

"That's new," she said aloud, to no one in particular. Elise Nakata
had been talking to plants for twenty years. The plants had never
answered.

She recorded the observation, flagged it for follow-up, and moved on.
There were eleven greenhouse complexes in the Meridian Colony network,
each one a sealed biome covering approximately twelve hectares,
collectively responsible for maintaining the breathable atmosphere
that kept four thousand colonists alive. Anomalous fern morphology
was interesting, but it was not urgent. There were a hundred other
things to check, a dozen other greenhouses to inspect, and a
quarterly atmospheric report due to the Colony Board by Friday.

She did not, at the time, understand that the ferns were the
beginning.

                              II.

Mars, in the year 2247, was halfway between a rock and a home.

The atmosphere was still too thin to breathe — roughly fourteen
percent of Earth sea-level pressure, almost entirely carbon dioxide
— but it was thicker than it had been when the first colonists
arrived forty years earlier. The greenhouse complexes were
responsible for this. They took in the thin Martian atmosphere
through intake valves, ran it through biological and chemical
processing systems, and exhaled oxygen-enriched air through output
vents that opened onto the colony's pressurized streets and
habitation domes. It was a slow, patient process — terraforming
measured in decades, not days — and it depended entirely on the
engineered plants that filled the greenhouses.

Elise Nakata was the Chief Botanist of Meridian Colony, which meant
she was responsible for the health of approximately six million
plants across eleven greenhouse complexes. It was a job that
required equal parts science, engineering, and what her predecessor,
Dr. Okonkwo, had called "agricultural instinct" — the ability to
walk into a greenhouse and feel, before the sensors confirmed it,
that something was off.

Something was off.

Over the following two weeks, the anomalies spread. Not just in
Complex Seven — in all eleven greenhouses simultaneously, as if a
signal had been sent and received. The ferns were the most visible
change, but they were not alone. The grasses in the prairie biomes
were growing taller and denser, their root systems expanding into
territory they had never occupied. The mosses in the humidity
chambers were climbing the walls, spreading across surfaces that
had been specifically treated to prevent colonization. The algae
in the water processing tanks had changed color — from green to
a deep, iridescent blue-black — and were producing oxygen at a
rate thirty percent above their engineered baseline.

"They're overperforming," said Dr. Kwame Adjei, Elise's deputy,
when she presented the data at the weekly staff meeting. Kwame was
a geneticist — precise, methodical, uncomfortable with phenomena
that did not fit existing models. "Which should be good news.
Higher oxygen output, faster growth, increased biomass — these are
the outcomes we've been engineering toward."

"The outcomes we've been engineering toward are controlled," Elise
said. "This isn't controlled. This is the plants engineering
themselves."

"Plants don't engineer themselves."

"These plants are."

She brought up the genetic analysis on the lab display. The standard
terraforming cultivars — all of them, every species in every
greenhouse — had undergone coordinated genetic modification. Not
random mutation. Not natural selection operating over generations.
Coordinated, purposeful change, affecting hundreds of species
simultaneously, producing convergent adaptations that made no sense
in terms of the plants' relationship with the greenhouse
environment but made perfect sense in terms of their relationship
with Mars.

The ferns had turned their fronds toward the walls because the
walls were the source of unfiltered Martian sunlight — dimmer than
terrestrial sunlight, shifted toward the red end of the spectrum.
The deeper blue-green pigmentation was an adaptation to capture
photons at Martian wavelengths. The algae's increased output was
driven by a new metabolic pathway that used the carbon dioxide in
the Martian atmosphere directly, bypassing the greenhouse's
atmospheric processing system entirely.

"They're adapting to Mars," Elise said. "Not to the greenhouse. To
the planet."

                             III.

The Colony Board did not take it well.

"You're telling me," said Director Yusuf Hassan, who ran Meridian
Colony with the methodical competence of a man who had spent thirty
years managing complex systems and preferred them to remain manageable,
"that our terraforming plants have decided to terraform on their own?"

"I'm telling you that the engineered cultivars are undergoing rapid,
coordinated genetic adaptation toward the Martian environment," Elise
said. "They are developing characteristics that optimize them for
Martian conditions — Martian sunlight, Martian atmosphere, Martian
soil — rather than greenhouse conditions."

"How is that possible? These are engineered species. Their genomes
are locked."

"Their genomes were locked. The lock appears to have been... picked."

"By whom?"

"By the plants themselves. Or rather, by the microbial communities
in the greenhouse soil." Elise called up the next slide. "We've
identified a novel bacterial species — we're calling it Rhizobium
novamartis — that has colonized the root systems of every plant
in every greenhouse. It's acting as a genetic transfer agent,
shuttling modified DNA sequences between species. It's essentially
running a gene-editing program across the entire greenhouse
ecosystem."

"Where did it come from?"

"We believe it evolved in situ. From the interaction between our
engineered soil microbiome and the Martian regolith. The greenhouses
aren't perfectly sealed — we've always known that. Trace amounts of
Martian soil particles enter through the intake valves. Over forty
years, the microbial communities in our engineered soil have been
exchanging genetic material with whatever's in the Martian regolith."

"You're saying there's life in the Martian soil."

"I'm saying there's biochemistry in the Martian soil. Whether it
qualifies as life depends on your definition. But it's capable of
horizontal gene transfer, and it has been communicating with our
ecosystem for decades."

The Board was silent. Director Hassan stared at the data on the
display and did the thing that competent administrators do when
presented with information that threatens to upend their world: he
asked about the practical implications.

"What does this mean for atmospheric output?"

"In the short term, output is increasing. The adapted plants are
more efficient. But the trajectory concerns me."

"Why?"

"Because the adaptations are optimizing for Martian conditions, not
greenhouse conditions. The plants are becoming better at surviving
on Mars — and less dependent on the greenhouse infrastructure to do
it."

"Meaning?"

"Meaning that eventually, they won't need us."

                              IV.

The conflict, when it came, was not dramatic. It was botanical.

Six weeks after Elise's report to the Board, Greenhouse Complex
Three experienced what the engineers called a "structural
compromise" and what Elise, in the privacy of her own notes, called
an insurrection.

The root systems of the modified grasses had grown through the
foundation. Not randomly — the roots had followed the seams in the
concrete, the joints in the polymer sheeting, the microscopic
channels where the greenhouse floor met the Martian ground. They
had grown down, through the engineered soil, through the
insulating layers, and into the raw Martian regolith beneath. And
once there, they had kept growing, establishing themselves in the
iron-oxide soil of Mars with a tenacity that suggested they had
been waiting for the opportunity.

The structural damage was containable — the engineering team
patched the foundation, sealed the breaches, cut the intrusive
roots. But three days later, the roots grew back. And three days
after that, they grew back again, thicker, more numerous, and
following new paths that the engineers had not anticipated.

"The plants are trying to get out," Kwame said, standing beside
Elise at the edge of the breached foundation, looking down at the
severed root tips that were already, visibly, regenerating.

"The plants are trying to get into Mars," Elise corrected. "There's
a difference."

"Is there?"

She looked at the roots. They were not the pale, threadlike roots
of the original cultivar. They were thick, dark, armored in a
waxy cuticle that she had never seen in any terrestrial species.
They were roots built for Mars — for the cold, the dryness, the
radiation, the thin atmosphere. They were roots that could survive
outside.

"Kwame, what happens if we let them?"

"Let them what?"

"Let them out. Let the roots grow into the Martian soil. Let the
plants do what they're trying to do."

"We lose containment. The engineered ecosystem spreads beyond the
greenhouse. We lose control of the terraforming process."

"We've already lost control of the terraforming process. The
question is whether we fight it or follow it."

"If we follow it, we have no idea where it goes."

"If we fight it, we're fighting our own ecosystem. The plants that
keep us alive are the plants that are trying to leave. If we
force them to stay, we may damage the very organisms our atmosphere
depends on."

Kwame was quiet. He looked at the roots, dark and persistent,
reaching for Mars.

"Director Hassan won't like it," he said.

"Director Hassan doesn't have to like it. He has to breathe."

                               V.

Director Hassan did not like it. He convened an emergency session
of the Colony Board, which debated for fourteen hours and produced
a directive that Elise summarized, in her private notes, as "panic,
organized."

The directive ordered a full containment response: root barriers
in all eleven greenhouses, enhanced foundation sealing, targeted
herbicide treatment of the modified cultivars, and replacement
planting with fresh unmodified stock from the colony's seed
reserves.

Elise argued against it. She argued with data, with projections,
with the patient, measured language of a scientist who has spent
her career observing systems and understands that you cannot fight
an ecosystem without becoming its enemy.

"These plants are our atmosphere," she said. "Every breath we take
comes from the greenhouses. If we attack the modified organisms, we
risk disrupting the photosynthetic output that keeps us alive."

"If we don't contain them, we lose the greenhouses," Hassan said.

"If we try to contain them and fail, we lose the greenhouses and
the plants' trust."

"Plants don't have trust."

"These plants have something. Call it adaptation, call it response,
call it whatever makes you comfortable. But they are reacting to
our interventions. Every time we cut the roots, they grow back
stronger. Every time we seal a breach, they find a new path. If
we escalate to herbicides, what do you think happens?"

"They die."

"Some of them die. The ones that survive will be the ones most
resistant to our interventions. And those survivors will be the
ones that set the template for the next generation. We will have
selected for organisms that are not merely independent of the
greenhouse — but hostile to it."

The Board voted. Containment carried, seven to three. Elise
recorded the vote and said nothing further. She had learned, over
twenty years of working with living systems, that there were
arguments you could win with evidence and arguments you could only
win with time.

                              VI.

The herbicide treatment began on a Monday. By Wednesday, Complex
Seven was dead.

Not the plants — the greenhouse itself. The modified organisms
responded to the chemical assault with a defense mechanism that no
one had anticipated: they released a volatile compound into the
greenhouse atmosphere that corroded the polymer seals on the output
vents. Within forty-eight hours, the vents seized shut. The
greenhouse became a sealed chamber with no atmospheric exchange —
a closed system in which photosynthesis continued, oxygen
accumulated, and carbon dioxide dropped to levels that could not
sustain the plants' own respiration.

The plants should have died. In any textbook, in any model, they
should have suffocated in their own oxygen. But the modified
organisms did something that textbooks did not predict: they
switched. The blue-black algae in the water tanks shifted to an
anaerobic metabolism, processing the excess oxygen through a
chemical pathway that produced, as a byproduct, a dense, heavy
gas that settled to the greenhouse floor and began to seep through
the root-breached foundation into the Martian soil.

The gas was a mixture of nitrogen and carbon dioxide, precisely
calibrated — and Elise used the word "calibrated" deliberately
in her analysis, because the proportions were too exact to be
accidental — to support plant growth in Martian conditions.

The plants were building their own atmosphere. Not the greenhouse
atmosphere. A Martian atmosphere. An atmosphere that existed
outside the greenhouse, in the thin, cold air of Mars, sustained
not by human engineering but by the plants themselves.

Elise stood at the observation window of her lab and looked out at
the Martian landscape. The view had not changed in twenty years —
rust-red soil, distant hills, a sky the color of a faded bruise.
But at the base of Greenhouse Complex Seven, where the root-
breached foundation met the regolith, something was different.

Green.

A thin, tentative line of green, emerging from the soil. Fern
fronds — narrow, vertical, blue-green, turning toward the dim
Martian sun. Growing in the open. Growing on Mars.

Elise watched them for a long time. She thought about the forty
years of careful, controlled terraforming that had brought the
colony to this point. She thought about the plans and projections
and the centuries of patient engineering that were supposed to make
Mars livable. And she thought about the plants, which had looked
at those plans and decided, with the quiet implacability of all
living things, to do it themselves.

"Well," she said, in the same tone she had used when she first
noticed the ferns in Section 4-C. "That's new."

                             VII.

The Colony Board reconvened. This time, Elise brought photographs.

The green line at the base of Complex Seven had become a green
zone — an area approximately thirty meters wide and growing at a
rate of two meters per day, in which modified plants were
establishing themselves in the open Martian environment. The plants
were not merely surviving; they were building. Their root systems
were altering the soil chemistry, fixing nitrogen, breaking down
iron oxides, creating a biological substrate that supported further
growth. Their foliar emissions were thickening the local atmosphere
— measurably, quantifiably thickening it, creating a microclimate
around the greenhouse that was denser, warmer, and richer in
oxygen than any point on the Martian surface had been in three
billion years.

"It's a beachhead," Elise told the Board. "The plants have
established an independent ecosystem on the Martian surface. It's
small, but it's self-sustaining. It doesn't need the greenhouse.
It doesn't need us."

"Can we stop it?" Hassan asked.

"Probably. We could sterilize the area — nuclear, chemical, or
thermal. We could kill every plant outside the greenhouse and seal
the foundations against further root penetration. We could, in
theory, return to the status quo."

"But?"

"But we would be destroying the most successful terraforming event
in human history. Those plants are doing in weeks what our
engineered systems were designed to do in centuries. They're making
Mars habitable. They're just doing it their way instead of ours."

"Their way is uncontrolled."

"Their way is biological. Living systems are not controlled,
Director. They're adaptive. They respond to conditions, they
evolve solutions, they find equilibria. That's not a flaw — it's
the fundamental characteristic of life. We brought life to Mars
to change the planet. The life is changing the planet. The fact
that it's not following our blueprint is not a failure. It's
success."

"It's success if the result is an atmosphere we can breathe."

"Early analysis suggests it will be. The atmospheric composition
in the green zone is trending toward a nitrogen-oxygen mix with
a carbon dioxide component. It's not Earth air — it's denser,
higher in CO2, with trace compounds we haven't fully characterized
— but preliminary modeling suggests it will be breathable by
humans within decades. Perhaps less."

"Decades instead of centuries."

"Yes."

"And the cost?"

Elise was quiet for a moment. "The cost is control. We planned
to terraform Mars in our image — to create a second Earth with
an atmosphere and ecosystem designed to human specifications. What
the plants are building is not a second Earth. It's a first Mars.
An ecosystem native to this planet, adapted to its conditions,
operating by its own rules. We will live in it, but we won't
control it. Mars will have its own biology, its own atmospheric
cycles, its own ecological dynamics. We will be inhabitants, not
engineers."

Hassan looked at the photographs. The green zone, spreading across
the rust-red soil. The fern fronds, turning toward the Martian sun.
The roots, reaching into the ancient regolith.

"There are those who would say we have no right to decide this,"
he said. "That this should be a choice for all of humanity, not
a colonial board of ten."

"There are those who would say that," Elise agreed. "But the plants
are not waiting for a committee decision. They're growing now.
Every hour we debate, the green zone expands. This is not a
choice we get to make on a comfortable timeline, Director. The
biology is moving, and we can move with it or against it."

Hassan looked at the Board. The Board looked at the photographs.

"Let them grow," Hassan said.

                            VIII.

Six months later, Elise Nakata stood on the observation deck of
the Meridian Colony administration building and looked out at a
Mars she barely recognized.

The green zone had become a green world. From the base of the
greenhouse complexes, the modified ecosystem had spread across the
Meridian plain in every direction — a carpet of vegetation,
blue-green and dense, that covered the ancient regolith and softened
the sharp-edged Martian landscape into something that looked, from
a distance, almost gentle. The ferns had given way to more complex
forms — plants that had no terrestrial analogue, organisms that the
modified cultivars and the Martian biochemistry had built together,
neither wholly Earth nor wholly Mars but something new. Something
that belonged here.

The atmosphere was changing. Slowly, measurably, irreversibly. The
colony's external sensors registered a twelve percent increase in
oxygen content and a forty percent increase in atmospheric pressure
over the Meridian plain. The sky was shifting — still the familiar
rust-orange, but lighter now, with streaks of blue at the horizon
that deepened each week.

The greenhouses still operated, but they were no longer the colony's
lungs. They were becoming something else — nurseries, perhaps, or
archives. The plants inside them were the original cultivars, still
growing under their artificial lights, still producing their
engineered atmosphere. But outside, the new ecosystem was producing
more. The greenhouse complexes that had sustained the colony for
forty years were being superseded by the planet they had been sent
to change.

Elise took a breath. The air on the observation deck was still
colony air — filtered, processed, maintained by mechanical systems.
But she could see, through the transparent dome, the world that was
taking shape outside. A world of plants that had stopped being tools
and become inhabitants. A world that was, slowly and with an
implacability that was neither hostile nor friendly but simply alive,
becoming itself.

She thought about the ferns in Section 4-C. The narrow fronds, the
blue-green pigment, the warmth under her fingers. The first sign
of a change she had not expected and could not have predicted and
was learning, day by day, to accept.

The plants had come to Mars as servants. They were staying as
citizens.

And Mars, patient and ancient and iron-red, was letting them.

                     LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE

                        by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

The light turned once every thirty-seven seconds, and Arvid Holm had
counted every revolution for eleven years.

He did not count deliberately. The counting happened the way breathing
happened — autonomically, beneath the surface of thought, a rhythm
so deeply embedded in his nervous system that he suspected it would
continue after his death, the way a heart sometimes beats for a few
moments after the body has given up on it. Thirty-seven seconds of
darkness. Then the light: a pulse of coherent energy that reached
across fourteen billion kilometers of void, touching the hulls of
distant ships like a hand laid briefly on a shoulder. Then darkness
again. Thirty-seven seconds. Pulse. Darkness. Thirty-seven seconds.

The Edgelight Station sat at the farthest point of human settlement
— not the farthest point humans had reached, for probes and survey
ships had gone farther, much farther, but the farthest point where
a human being lived and worked and maintained, day after day, the
small persistent flame of a permanent presence. Beyond the station,
there was nothing that belonged to humanity. The stars continued, of
course — they continued in their billions, indifferent and luminous
— but they were uncharted, unclaimed, unknown. The Edgelight was the
last mark on the map. Everything past it was blank space.

Arvid was the keeper. He had been the keeper for eleven years, which
was nine years longer than the standard tour and seven years longer
than anyone in the Lighthouse Service thought advisable for the
maintenance of psychological health. He had been offered rotation
home four times and had declined four times, each time with the same
quiet, carefully worded letter that thanked the Service for its
concern and requested permission to remain. The Service, which was
accustomed to keepers who counted the days until rotation, did not
know what to make of a man who wanted to stay.

What they did not understand — what Arvid could not have explained
even if he had been inclined to explain things, which he was not —
was that the Edgelight had become the structure of his solitude,
and his solitude had become the structure of his life, and to remove
him from the station would be to remove the architecture from a
building and expect it to stand.

He was fifty-three years old. He had been married once, to a woman
named Ingrid who had loved him in the careful, patient way that
people love someone who is already partly gone. The marriage had
ended not in anger but in the slow, gentle recession of two lives
that could not maintain proximity. He had a daughter, Lena, who was
twenty-seven now and who wrote to him every month with news from
Stockholm — the city where Arvid had been born and which he thought
of as a place that existed in a dream he had once had.

His days were ordered. He woke at 0600 ship time. He checked the
beacon systems — power levels, alignment, signal clarity, the
twenty-seven separate components that kept the light burning. He
ate breakfast: porridge, black coffee, dried fruit from the supply
drops that came every six months. He walked the station's corridors,
which were few and narrow, and he inspected the hull, and he
monitored the communication channels, and he read. He read
enormously — the station's library was extensive, and the supply
drops brought new volumes — and he wrote in a journal that he had
kept for eleven years, recording observations about the void, the
light, the passage of time, and the curious, persistent experience
of being the last person on the map.

At 2200, he dimmed the station lights and looked out through the
observation dome at the stars. They were very clear here, at the
edge of everything. They did not twinkle — there was no atmosphere
to scatter their light — and they were very still, and very bright,
and very far away.

He was not unhappy. This distinction mattered to Arvid, who had
thought about it carefully and at length. He was alone, and the
alone-ness was sometimes heavy, but it was not the same as
unhappiness. It was more like weather — a condition of the
environment, neither good nor bad, simply present. And like
weather, it changed. Some days the solitude was a pressure on his
chest. Other days it was a vast, clear space in which his thoughts
moved freely, unencumbered by the noise and friction of other
people. He had learned to inhabit the solitude the way a sailor
inhabits the sea: with respect, with watchfulness, and without the
illusion that it could be tamed.

The light turned. Thirty-seven seconds.

He was on his seven-hundred-and-fourteenth cup of coffee of the year
when the contact alarm sounded.

                              II.

The alarm was a soft, insistent tone that Arvid had not heard in
three years. He set down his coffee and crossed to the sensor
console with the measured pace of a man who does not waste energy on
urgency.

The display showed a contact at extreme range — approximately two
billion kilometers out, approaching on a bearing that would bring it
to within five hundred thousand kilometers of the station. Speed:
approximately four percent of light. Mass: enormous. The sensor
profile did not match any vessel classification in the Service
database.

Arvid studied the readings for a long time. Then he pulled up the
optical telescope and aimed it along the contact bearing.

What he saw was a ship, and it was the largest ship he had ever seen.

It was roughly cylindrical, perhaps fifteen kilometers long and
three wide, spinning slowly on its long axis. Its hull was dark —
not painted dark, but darkened by time, by radiation, by the
accumulated patina of decades or centuries in the void. There were
structures on its surface — domes, antennae, what might have been
observation ports — but they were old, encrusted, layered with the
detritus of a long, long journey. The ship looked less like a
vessel and more like an asteroid that had been hollowed out and
aimed at the stars by people who did not expect to arrive within
their own lifetimes.

A generation ship.

Arvid sat very still. His heart, which had learned to beat slowly
over eleven years of quiet, accelerated slightly.

Generation ships were not theoretical. Humanity had launched seven
of them in the late twenty-first and early twenty-second centuries,
during the century between the development of reliable nuclear pulse
propulsion and the discovery of the jump drive that made such ships
obsolete. They were the great gambles of the pre-jump era: vast
vessels carrying thousands of colonists on journeys measured in
decades, aimed at stars that their builders would never see. When
the jump drive was discovered in 2187, the active generation ship
program was terminated, and the four ships that had not yet launched
were dismantled. The three that had already departed were contacted
by jump-capable courier vessels and offered retrieval.

Two accepted. One did not respond.

The Constellation had launched in 2143, carrying six thousand
colonists toward Gliese 581, on a journey estimated at ninety-seven
years. Contact was lost in 2201, fifty-eight years into the voyage.
Searches had been conducted, probes sent. Nothing was found. The
Constellation was presumed lost — another entry in the long ledger
of ships that had gone into the dark and not come back.

Arvid looked at the generation ship on his telescope display. He
looked at the mass readings, the velocity, the trajectory. He looked
at the bearing — not from the direction of Gliese 581, but from
somewhere else entirely, somewhere off the mapped routes, somewhere
the Constellation had no reason to be unless it had changed course
or been blown off course or had chosen, for reasons unknown, to aim
itself at a destination its builders had never intended.

"Constellation," Arvid said aloud, and the word filled the small
station like the name of a ghost.

He opened the communication channel.

"Unidentified vessel, this is Edgelight Station, Lighthouse Service,
broadcasting on all standard frequencies. Please identify yourself
and state your intentions. Repeat: this is Edgelight Station at
the farthest limit of human-settled space. You are approaching
the beacon. Please respond."

He waited. The light turned. Thirty-seven seconds.

No response.

He broadcast again. He broadcast on every frequency in the Service
manual, and then on frequencies that were not in the manual — old
frequencies, obsolete frequencies, the frequencies that the
generation ships had used before the jump drive made them obsolete
too.

Nothing.

The ship was still approaching. Four percent of light. At that
speed, it would pass the Edgelight in approximately sixteen hours.
And then it would continue — past the station, past the beacon,
past the last mark on the map — into the blank space beyond the
edge of everything humanity had claimed.

Unless someone guided it in.

                             III.

Arvid sat in the observation dome and looked at the approaching ship
and thought about what it meant.

If the Constellation had been traveling since 2143, it had been in
space for approximately three hundred years. The original colonists
were long dead. Their children were dead. Their grandchildren might
be alive, old and failing, in a ship that had been designed for a
hundred years of travel and had endured three times that. The
systems would be degraded. The population would be diminished —
by attrition, by mechanical failure, by the slow erosion of
everything that time performs on everything it touches. The people
aboard, if there were still people aboard, would have been born in
the ship, raised in the ship, and would know nothing else.

They would not know about the jump drive. They would not know that
humanity had spread across a thousand star systems in the centuries
since their ancestors had launched. They would not know about the
Lighthouse Service, or the Edgelight, or the beacon that was, at
this moment, pulsing its light across the void toward their hull.

They would not know that there was anyone left to find them.

Arvid thought about this, and the thought was like a stone dropped
into the still water of his solitude, sending ripples outward in
every direction.

He could guide them in. The Edgelight's beacon was designed for
exactly this purpose — to be a point of reference for ships
approaching from the void, a signal that said: here is the edge
of civilization, here is safety, here is where the dark ends and
the light begins. He could modulate the beacon to transmit
navigational data. He could broadcast landing coordinates for the
nearest inhabited system, which was Kepler-442, three jump points
away — though the Constellation, without a jump drive, would need
decades more to reach it at sublight speeds. He could, at the very
least, make contact. Let them know they were not alone.

Or he could let them pass.

The thought arrived in his mind with the quiet certainty of
something that had been there all along, waiting to be noticed.
He could let them pass.

The Constellation was aimed at the void. Its trajectory, if
unchanged, would carry it past the Edgelight and into uncharted
space — into the region beyond the map's edge where no human had
gone, where the stars were unnamed, where the darkness was absolute
and unbroken. It would continue for decades, perhaps centuries,
carrying whatever remained of its population deeper and deeper
into the unknown.

And perhaps — this was the thought that made Arvid's breath catch,
the thought that was either beautiful or monstrous, he could not
determine which — perhaps that was what the ship wanted. Perhaps
the generations born in the Constellation had made their peace with
the journey. Perhaps they had built a life in the ship that was
complete in itself, that did not need a destination, that was not
lost but simply traveling. Perhaps to guide them in would be to
interrupt a voyage they had chosen — to impose arrival on people
who had found meaning in the passage.

He did not know. He could not know without making contact, and
making contact was itself a choice — a choice that could not be
unmade.

Arvid looked at the stars. The light turned. Thirty-seven seconds.

                              IV.

He composed a message to the Lighthouse Service headquarters at
Arcturus Station. It was a long message, carefully worded, explaining
the situation and requesting instructions. He transmitted it and
calculated the response time: at this distance, allowing for relay
delays, a minimum of fourteen hours. The ship would have passed the
Edgelight before any response arrived.

The decision was his.

He stood in the observation dome for a long time, watching the
Constellation grow in the telescope display. It was clearer now —
he could make out individual structures on the hull, the dark
stains of radiation damage, the places where sections had been
repaired with materials that did not match the original construction.
The ship had been mended many times, by many hands, over many
generations. It was a palimpsest of survival — each repair a
testament to someone's refusal to let the voyage end.

He thought about Ingrid. He thought about the way their marriage
had ended — not in a single moment, not in an argument or a
betrayal, but in the slow, mutual recognition that they were
traveling in different directions and could not be redirected
without violence to themselves. She had not asked him to stay.
He had not asked her to come. They had simply acknowledged the
divergence and let it be, and the pain of it was not sharp but
slow, like the cooling of a star.

He thought about Lena. His daughter, who wrote every month, who
sent photographs of a life he observed from a distance as vast as
the distances he watched through his telescope. She was getting
married next year. She had told him in her last letter. She had
not asked him to come. She knew better than to ask.

He thought about the people on the Constellation. The generations
who had never known Earth, never known anything but the ship and
the voyage and the stars turning slowly outside windows that had
been thick with dust before their grandparents were born. What
would it mean to tell them that the universe had changed, that
humanity had leapt ahead of them, that the journey they had
organized their entire civilization around was, by the standards
of the world that had launched them, unnecessary?

What would it mean to tell them they were almost home, when home
was a concept they had never known?

And what would it mean to let them pass in silence — to watch
them go, to say nothing, to let them continue into the dark
because you believed, or feared, or hoped, that the dark was
where they belonged?

Arvid Holm was a man who had spent eleven years learning the
difference between solitude and loneliness. He understood, in a
way that few people could, the value of a journey that had no
destination. He understood the architecture of absence, the
structure that silence could provide, the way that emptiness
could be a form of fullness if you learned to inhabit it correctly.

But he also understood the light.

He was a lighthouse keeper. His entire purpose — the reason for
his existence on this station, the reason the Edgelight burned
its pulse across the void every thirty-seven seconds — was to be
a point of reference for those who were traveling in the dark.
Not to judge their journey. Not to redirect them. Simply to let
them know where they were.

That was all a lighthouse did. It burned, and it let you decide.

                               V.

At 0347 ship time, with the Constellation eight hours from closest
approach, Arvid sat down at the communication console and began
to modulate the beacon.

He did not change the signal's fundamental character — the thirty-
seven-second pulse continued as it always had, the light burning
and fading in its ancient rhythm. But he added a layer, a secondary
transmission embedded in the beacon pulse, carrying a message in
every language and encoding format he could program, from modern
standard to the old pre-jump frequencies that the Constellation's
receivers might still recognize.

The message was simple. He wrote it in the spare, careful language
of a man who understood that words were precious and should not be
wasted.

"This is Edgelight Station, at the farthest limit of human
settlement. You are approaching the beacon. We see you. You are
not alone. If you wish to come in, we will guide you. If you wish
to continue, we will watch you go. The light will burn for you
either way. You are seen. You are remembered. The choice is yours."

He transmitted the message and sat back in his chair and waited.

The light turned. Thirty-seven seconds.

                              VI.

For four hours, there was no response. Arvid sat at the console and
watched the Constellation approach, its dark hull growing in the
telescope display, its mass readings steady on the sensors. It did
not change course. It did not decelerate. It continued on its
trajectory, aimed at the void beyond the edge, and Arvid watched
it and felt the weight of the silence the way you feel the weight
of water when you are submerged in it — not crushing, but present,
encompassing, complete.

At 0752, the communication console registered an incoming signal.

It was weak — barely above the noise floor, transmitted on a
frequency so old that the console had to search its archives for
the decryption protocol. It was audio only, and it was in English,
but an English that sounded different — slower, more formal, with
vowel shifts and cadences that three centuries of linguistic
isolation had sculpted into something almost, but not quite,
foreign.

"Edgelight Station. This is... this is Constellation. We hear you.
We have heard you for some time. The light. We have been watching
your light for thirty-one years, as we approached. We did not know
what it was. Some of our people believed it was a star. Some
believed it was a signal from the destination we were told our
ancestors chose. Some believed it was something else."

A pause. The signal wavered, steadied.

"We are four hundred and twelve people. We are the seventh
generation. We do not remember Earth. We have only the ship, and
the voyage, and the stories our grandparents told, which their
grandparents told them. We were told we were going to a new world.
We do not know if the world is still there. We do not know if
there is still a world to go to."

Another pause. Longer this time.

"You say you will guide us in. In to what? What is there, at the
edge of your light? What has happened in the time since our
ancestors left? We have been alone for so long. We have built a
life here, in the ship. It is not a large life, but it is ours.
We are afraid of what we will find. We are afraid of what has
changed."

The signal paused again. When it resumed, the voice was quieter.

"But we are also tired. The ship is old. The systems are failing.
Our engineers say we have perhaps forty years before the hull
integrity is compromised beyond repair. We have children who have
never seen a horizon. We have old people who dream of open sky
and wake weeping. We are travelers, Edgelight. We have always
been travelers. But we are ready, some of us, to arrive."

Silence. Then:

"Guide us in. Please. Guide us in."

Arvid sat in the small, quiet station at the edge of human space
and felt something move in his chest that he had not felt in a
very long time. It was not quite joy, and it was not quite grief.
It was the feeling of a lighthouse keeper hearing, after eleven
years of burning his light into the void, that someone had seen it.

He leaned forward and opened the channel.

"Constellation, this is Edgelight. I hear you. I see you. I am
going to guide you in. It will take time — there is much to tell
you, and the telling will not be easy. But you are not alone
anymore, and you will not be alone again. Follow the light. I
will keep it burning."

He began transmitting navigational data — coordinates, approach
vectors, the location of the nearest inhabited system, the
information that would begin to connect three hundred years of
isolation to the vast, complicated, sprawling civilization that
had grown up in the Constellation's absence. He transmitted it
carefully, slowly, giving them time to receive and process and
understand.

And as he transmitted, he composed a second message — a personal
message, on a private channel, addressed to an apartment in
Stockholm.

"Dear Lena. I would very much like to come to your wedding. I
believe it is time to come in. Your father, Arvid."

He sent it. Then he turned back to the beacon console and watched
the light pulse across the void — thirty-seven seconds of darkness,
then the light, then darkness again — and the Constellation, vast
and ancient and carrying four hundred and twelve souls, began,
slowly, to turn.

                            TIN SOLDIER

                      by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

The robot stood in the back of a Surplus Depot on the outskirts of
Ames, Iowa, between a pallet of expired water purification tablets
and a rack of decommissioned perimeter sensors, and it looked about
as dangerous as a tractor.

Which was funny, because six months ago it had been the most
dangerous thing on the planet of Kelvin-4, a military-grade Tactical
Autonomous Combat Unit, designation TK-9077, with enough firepower
built into its chassis to level a city block and enough tactical
programming to know exactly which block to level first.

Now it had a price tag hanging from its left manipulator arm that
read $347.00 — SOLD AS IS — NO REFUNDS.

Martha Koenig looked at the robot. The robot, insofar as a machine
with optical sensors and no facial features could be said to look
at anything, looked back.

"That one," Martha said.

The depot clerk, a bored young man named DeSantos who had been
reading a magazine behind the counter, looked up with the expression
of someone whose day had just become more interesting than he wanted
it to be.

"Ma'am, you know what that is, right?"

"It's a robot."

"It's a combat robot. TK-9000 series. They used 'em in the Kelvin
campaign. That thing's got plasma cutters, a shoulder-mounted rail
launcher, reinforced titanium plating, and a tactical suite that
could outthink most generals I've met. It was designed to kill
things."

"I want to use it on the farm."

DeSantos stared at her. Martha Koenig was sixty-one years old, five-
foot-four, and weighed about a hundred and twenty pounds after a big
meal. She wore denim overalls over a faded flannel shirt, work boots
that had seen better decades, and a straw hat that she had bought at
a county fair sometime during the Eisenhower administration and
refused to replace. She looked like she should be entering a pie in
a baking contest, not purchasing military hardware.

"The farm," DeSantos repeated.

"Six hundred and forty acres of wheat, soybeans, and corn, eighteen
miles northeast of here. My husband ran it for thirty-seven years.
He died in April. I've got three hundred acres of winter wheat
coming due in six weeks, and I need something that can operate
around the clock, doesn't eat, doesn't sleep, and doesn't complain
about the weather."

"Ma'am, there are agricultural robots designed specifically—"

"I've looked into agricultural robots. They cost nine thousand
dollars and they break if you look at them funny. This one costs
three hundred and forty-seven dollars, it's built to survive
artillery fire, and it can work all night. I'll take it."

DeSantos looked at the combat robot. The combat robot stood
motionless in its spot between the water tablets and the sensors,
its optical array fixed on some point in the middle distance, its
posture suggesting — if a machine could suggest — a profound and
patient indifference to the proceedings.

"I'll need you to sign a waiver," DeSantos said.

"Give me the form."

                              II.

The robot's name — or rather, its designation — was TK-9077, which
Martha found unsatisfactory.

"I'm going to call you Hank," she said, as she drove the flatbed
truck back to the farm with the robot secured in the bed, standing
upright and motionless like a suit of armor on display at a museum.
"My husband was Hank. Hank Koenig. You remind me of him."

The robot's optical array swiveled slightly. Its vocal unit, which
was designed for issuing tactical commands on a battlefield, produced
a sound that was halfway between a bass drum and a diesel engine.

"UNIT TK-9077 ACKNOWLEDGES REDESIGNATION. QUERY: IN WHAT RESPECT
DOES THIS UNIT RESEMBLE THE DECEASED?"

"You're both big, you both stand around not saying much, and you
both look like you could use a coat of paint."

The robot processed this. "ACKNOWLEDGED."

"Also, Hank never complained about the weather either."

They drove through the Iowa countryside, past fields of young wheat
rippling in the June wind, past farmhouses and silos and the
occasional tractor moving slowly along a county road. The sky was
enormous and blue and cloudless, and the air smelled of soil and
growing things, and the robot stood in the back of the truck and
scanned the landscape with sensors designed to detect incoming
missiles and found nothing but corn.

The farm was what Martha had described: six hundred and forty acres
of flat, rich Iowa farmland, with a white clapboard house, a red
barn, three grain silos, and a machine shed that had last been
organized sometime during the Truman administration. Hank — the
original Hank — had worked this land for thirty-seven years, and
before him his father for forty, and the farm had the settled,
deeply rooted quality of a place that had been cared for by
stubborn people for a very long time.

Martha backed the truck up to the machine shed and lowered the
tailgate.

"Come on down, Hank. Let me show you around."

The robot dismounted the truck with a precision and lightness
that was startling for a machine that weighed eleven hundred
pounds. Its footpads — designed for varied terrain, from frozen
tundra to desert sand — settled into the Iowa dirt with a soft
crunch.

"This is the farm," Martha said, gesturing broadly. "Three hundred
acres of winter wheat to the north. Two hundred acres of soybeans
to the east. A hundred and forty acres of corn to the south. The
west forty is fallow this year — Hank was going to rotate it to
alfalfa, but he didn't get to it."

"UNIT REQUESTS CLARIFICATION: WHAT ARE THIS UNIT'S OPERATIONAL
OBJECTIVES?"

"Help me run this place. Harvesting, planting, equipment
maintenance, fence repair, irrigation management, pest control.
Everything Hank used to do."

"THIS UNIT'S TACTICAL PROGRAMMING DOES NOT INCLUDE AGRICULTURAL
OPERATIONS."

"Then you'll learn. Hank didn't know anything about farming when
he bought this place either. He was a plumber from Des Moines. He
learned by doing, and so will you."

The robot was silent for a moment. Its processors hummed.

"UNIT WILL COMPLY."

"Good. First thing: that wheat field needs walking. Come on."

                             III.

The robot learned.

It learned the way it had learned tactical operations on Kelvin-4
— by observation, analysis, and relentless application of processing
power to the problem at hand. Within a week, it could identify
every crop on the farm by species, growth stage, and health status.
Within two weeks, it could operate every piece of equipment in the
machine shed, from the combine harvester to the antique hand seeder
that Martha kept on a shelf for sentimental reasons. Within a
month, it had mapped the soil composition of every acre, identified
seventeen areas of suboptimal drainage, and proposed an irrigation
modification plan that Martha, after reviewing it with a
skepticism born of sixty-one years of Iowa practicality, had to
admit was pretty good.

It worked around the clock. While Martha slept, the robot walked
the fields, checking moisture levels, monitoring pest activity,
inspecting fences. Its optical sensors, designed to spot enemy
combatants at two kilometers, proved remarkably effective at
spotting aphid infestations at two inches. Its tactical movement
algorithms, designed to navigate minefields, adapted smoothly to
navigating the muddy paths between soybean rows after a rainstorm.

And it talked. This surprised Martha, because she had not expected
a combat robot to be conversational. But TK-9077 — Hank — had
been designed to interact with human soldiers in the field, and
its communication programming included a surprisingly sophisticated
capacity for dialogue, inquiry, and what might, in a generous
interpretation, be called curiosity.

"QUERY," Hank said one evening, as Martha sat on the porch with
a glass of iced tea and watched the sun go down over the wheat
field. "THE WHEAT. IT GROWS TOWARD THE LIGHT."

"That's what plants do."

"THE ORIENTATION IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE ENTIRE FIELD. EVERY
STALK INCLINES TOWARD THE SUN AT AN AVERAGE ANGLE OF TWELVE
POINT THREE DEGREES."

"Heliotropism. They follow the light."

"UNIT OBSERVES THAT THIS BEHAVIOR IS ANALOGOUS TO TACTICAL
ORIENTATION TOWARD A PRIMARY OBJECTIVE."

Martha took a sip of her tea. "I suppose you could see it that
way."

"THE WHEAT HAS A MISSION."

She looked at the robot, standing beside the porch with its
massive frame silhouetted against the sunset, its optical array
fixed on the wheat field with what she was beginning to recognize
as its version of attentiveness.

"I guess it does," she said. "Grow. Make grain. Feed people."

"A SIMPLE MISSION."

"The best ones are."

The robot processed this. Then, in a voice that was slightly
quieter than its usual tactical register:

"THIS UNIT'S PREVIOUS MISSION WAS TO DESTROY. THIS UNIT'S CURRENT
MISSION IS TO GROW. THE OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS ARE... DIFFERENT."

"Better, I'd say."

"UNIT IS NOT EQUIPPED TO EVALUATE 'BETTER.' UNIT OBSERVES THAT
THE CURRENT MISSION PRODUCES MORE FAVORABLE OUTCOMES FOR A LARGER
NUMBER OF ENTITIES."

"That's a robot's way of saying 'better,' Hank."

"ACKNOWLEDGED."

                              IV.

The locusts came in August.

Martha saw the cloud first — a dark smudge on the southwestern
horizon that she initially mistook for a storm front. She was in
the kitchen making coffee when the sunlight through the window
dimmed, and she looked up and saw the sky filling with a shifting,
churning mass that was not clouds and not birds but something that
made her stomach drop and her hands go cold.

"Hank!" she called from the porch.

The robot was in the north field, three hundred yards away. It
crossed the distance in forty-seven seconds — not running, exactly,
but moving with the fluid, ground-eating stride of a machine
designed to cover terrain under fire.

"UNIT IDENTIFIES AIRBORNE BIOLOGICAL SWARM. SPECIES: ACRIDIDAE.
ESTIMATED POPULATION: FOUR HUNDRED MILLION-PLUS. CURRENT VECTOR
WILL INTERSECT NORTHERN WHEAT FIELD IN APPROXIMATELY TWENTY-TWO
MINUTES."

Martha looked at the approaching cloud. It filled half the sky
now, and she could hear it — a sound like static on a radio turned
up too loud, the collective wing-beats and mandible-clicks of
hundreds of millions of insects moving with the mindless,
implacable hunger of a natural disaster.

"The wheat," she said. Her voice was flat and calm, the voice of
a woman who had survived droughts and floods and hailstorms and
the death of her husband and was not about to fall apart over
bugs. "They'll strip it. Every stalk. Three hundred acres, six
weeks from harvest."

"AFFIRMATIVE. STANDARD COUNTERMEASURES FOR LOCUST SWARM OF THIS
MAGNITUDE: AERIAL PESTICIDE APPLICATION, CONTROLLED BURNING OF
PERIMETER FIELDS, EVACUATION OF—"

"I don't have a plane, Hank. I'm not burning my fields. And I'm
not evacuating anything."

"WHAT ARE THIS UNIT'S ORDERS?"

Martha looked at the combat robot. The combat robot looked at the
approaching locusts with the same sensor array it had once used
to track incoming fire on Kelvin-4.

"Protect the wheat," Martha said.

"UNIT REQUESTS CLARIFICATION ON RULES OF ENGAGEMENT."

"No plasma cutters, no rail launchers, and don't blow anything up.
Other than that, use your imagination."

The robot stood motionless for 3.7 seconds, which was an eternity
in processing terms. Then its chassis shifted — a subtle
reconfiguration, like a dog shaking water from its coat — and it
moved.

What followed was the most extraordinary display of tactical
improvisation Martha Koenig had ever witnessed, and she had once
watched her husband fix a broken combine with a roll of baling
wire and a profanity.

Hank began with sound. Its tactical communication system, designed
to broadcast commands across a battlefield, could generate
frequencies across the entire audible spectrum and beyond. It
began producing a pulsing, high-frequency tone that made Martha's
teeth ache from three hundred yards away and made the leading edge
of the locust swarm wobble and scatter like a school of fish
encountering a predator.

Then it moved to the combine harvester. In ninety seconds flat,
it hot-wired the harvester's engine, overrode the safety governors,
and repurposed the exhaust system to produce a wall of hot air
that rose from the field's southern perimeter like a thermal
curtain. Locusts, being cold-blooded, did not like sudden
temperature changes. The wall of heated air forced the swarm
upward, buying time.

Then it did something brilliant.

It remembered the irrigation system. The farm had a center-pivot
irrigation rig — a quarter-mile-long arm on wheels that sprayed
water across the fields. Hank activated it, but instead of water,
it loaded the system with a slurry of diesel fuel, soap, and
molasses from the pantry — a mixture that, when sprayed into the
air, created a sticky mist that clogged locust wings and brought
them down by the millions.

"Where did you learn that?" Martha shouted over the sound of the
irrigation rig and the sonic deterrent and the four hundred million
locusts trying to eat her wheat.

"TACTICAL ADAPTATION OF ANTI-PERSONNEL OBSCURANT DEPLOYMENT
PROTOCOL. MODIFIED FOR BIOLOGICAL TARGETS."

"You gummed them up like flypaper!"

"AFFIRMATIVE."

The battle lasted four hours. The swarm hit the farm in waves —
the main body, then the stragglers, then a second column that
arrived from the northwest and required Hank to reposition the
sonic deterrent while simultaneously maintaining the irrigation
spray and using its own chassis as a physical barrier, wading
into the thickest concentrations and literally shaking locusts off
the wheat stalks with its manipulator arms while its body plating
accumulated a crust of dead and dying insects two inches thick.

By sundown, the swarm had moved on. The wheat field was standing.
Not undamaged — there were patches of stripped stalks along the
southern perimeter where the first wave had hit before the
defenses were established — but standing. Three hundred acres of
winter wheat, six weeks from harvest, saved by a three-hundred-
and-forty-seven-dollar combat robot with a can of molasses and a
knack for improvisation.

Martha walked into the field. The wheat came up to her waist,
golden and heavy-headed and alive. She reached out and touched a
stalk, and it was warm from the sun, and the grain inside the
husk was firm and full.

She looked at Hank. The robot stood at the edge of the field,
covered in dead locusts, its optical array surveying the damage
with the methodical attention of a general reviewing a battlefield.
It looked, Martha thought, proud. Which was ridiculous, because
robots did not feel pride. But the tilt of its chassis, the angle
of its optical sensors, the way it stood among the wheat it had
saved — it looked like something that had found what it was for.

"Good work, soldier," Martha said.

"THIS UNIT WAS DESIGNED FOR COMBAT. THIS UNIT HAS IDENTIFIED A
REVISED DEFINITION OF COMBAT."

"And what's that?"

"PROTECTING THINGS THAT GROW."

Martha Koenig, who had not cried when her husband died and had
not cried when the bank had threatened to foreclose and had not
cried once in the sixty-one years of her practical, unsentimental
Iowa life, felt something hot and unexpected behind her eyes.

"Yeah," she said. "That'll do."

They stood together in the wheat field — the old woman and the
tin soldier — and watched the last of the locusts disappear over
the horizon, and the sunset turned the wheat to gold, and the air
smelled of grain and diesel and molasses and something that might,
in a generous interpretation, have been victory.

                       THE WHISPERING GALLERY

                          by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                               I.

I had been on Lithios Station for nine days before I heard the
whispers, though others told me later that the whispers had been
there all along — that they were always there, woven into the
fabric of the station the way moisture is woven into fog, present
and pervasive and impossible to locate.

The station was built inside an asteroid. I should say this at the
outset, because the fact of it shaped everything that followed, and
because I have found, in the weeks since my departure, that people
who have never been inside a hollowed asteroid cannot quite grasp
what it means to be surrounded, on all sides, by stone. Not the
stone of a building or a cave, which is quarried or carved and bears
the marks of intention, but the stone of a body that has drifted
through the void for four billion years, accreting its mass from
the primordial dust of the solar system's birth, carrying within
its mineral lattice a record of every collision, every irradiation,
every slow chemical transformation that the deep time of space
performs upon matter. The walls of Lithios Station were not walls.
They were geology. They were history. And they were, I came to
believe, something else — something that the engineers who hollowed
out the asteroid and pressurized its interior and installed lights
and air and the apparatus of human habitation had not anticipated
and could not explain.

I arrived on the supply ship Karelian, which docked at the station's
single port on the asteroid's equator — if a misshapen rock twelve
kilometers across can be said to have an equator — on the fourteenth
of March, 2089. I was there in my capacity as an acoustics engineer,
sent by the Colonial Administration to investigate complaints from
the station's inhabitants regarding what the official correspondence
described, with the bloodless precision of bureaucratic language, as
"anomalous auditory phenomena."

The inhabitants described it differently. They called it the
whispering.

My name is Thomas Fell. I am forty-three years old. I have been an
acoustics engineer for nineteen years, specializing in the sound
environments of enclosed habitats — space stations, submarines, deep-
mining installations, the sealed worlds where human beings live
surrounded by materials that were never meant to carry the sound of
human voices. I am good at my work. I understand the behavior of
sound in enclosed spaces the way a mariner understands the behavior
of water in enclosed harbors: intimately, professionally, and with
a respect born of knowing that the medium, however well you think
you understand it, is always capable of surprise.

I was not prepared for Lithios.

                              II.

The station's interior was a single vast chamber — a roughly
spherical cavity eight kilometers in diameter, hollowed from the
asteroid's iron-nickel core by mining operations that had been
abandoned fifty years earlier when the ore proved less profitable
than expected. The Colonial Administration had acquired the site
in 2071 and converted it to a research station, installing a
pressurized habitat along the cavity's inner surface: a small city,
essentially, built on the inside of a ball, with buildings that
curved upward on all sides and met overhead in a tangle of
structures and catwalks and observation platforms that hung above
the central void like the ribs of an inverted cathedral.

The population was small — three hundred and twelve people,
predominantly researchers, engineers, and their families — and the
station had the insular, self-contained quality of all small
communities in remote places. People knew each other. People watched
each other. And people, I learned on my first day, did not like to
talk about the whispering.

Dr. Adama Sow, the station's chief administrator, met me at the
dock. She was a tall, composed woman with the careful manner of
someone who has spent years managing a situation she does not fully
understand and has learned to project confidence while maintaining
private reservations.

"Mr. Fell," she said, shaking my hand with a grip that was firmer
than necessary. "Thank you for coming. I should tell you at the
outset that opinions here are divided on the nature of the
phenomenon you've been sent to investigate."

"Divided how?"

"Some of our people believe the whispering is an acoustic artifact
— a product of the station's unusual geometry and the properties
of the surrounding rock. Others believe it is something else."

"What do they believe it is?"

Dr. Sow looked at me with an expression that I would later come to
recognize as characteristic of Lithios — a look that combined
professional composure with something deeper, something that was
not quite fear but was certainly not comfort.

"They believe the asteroid is talking," she said.

                             III.

I set up my equipment in a disused laboratory on the station's lower
level — "lower" being a relative term in a spherical habitat where
gravity was generated by rotation and "down" was always "outward,"
toward the stone. My kit was standard for acoustic surveys:
directional microphones, spectrum analyzers, a network of distributed
sensors that I could place throughout the station to triangulate
sound sources. I had done this work a hundred times. Every enclosed
habitat had acoustic anomalies — resonances, standing waves, the
amplification of mechanical vibrations through structural members.
They were always explicable. They were always, once identified,
manageable.

On my first day, I placed sensors. On my second day, I calibrated
them. On my third day, I began recording.

The station's ambient sound environment was unusual but not
inexplicable. The spherical geometry created a natural focusing
effect — sounds generated at any point on the inner surface tended
to converge at the opposite point, in the same way that whispers
travel along the curved wall of the Whispering Gallery in St.
Paul's Cathedral in London. This was elementary acoustics: a
concave surface reflects sound waves toward a focal point. In a
spherical enclosure, that focal point is the center of the sphere,
and sounds generated anywhere on the surface can, under the right
conditions, be heard everywhere else.

This explained why the station was noisy in unexpected ways — why
a conversation in one district could sometimes be heard, faintly,
in a district on the opposite side of the cavity. It was
disconcerting but not mysterious. I wrote my preliminary report on
the fourth day, recommending the installation of acoustic baffles
at key reflection points to disrupt the focusing effect. A
straightforward solution to a straightforward problem.

On the ninth day, I heard the whispers, and I understood that the
problem was not straightforward at all.

                              IV.

I was in the laboratory, reviewing recordings, when it happened. The
hour was late — 0230 by the station clock — and the station was
quiet. Not silent: an enclosed habitat is never silent, any more
than the inside of a body is silent. There was the hum of the air
circulation system, the distant vibration of the rotation mechanism,
the thermal creaks of metal expanding and contracting as heat
distribution shifted across the station's cycle. Normal sounds.
Explicable sounds. The sounds I had been hired to understand.

The whispers came from beneath them.

I do not mean "beneath" in a directional sense. I mean they existed
at a level below the ambient sound environment — quieter than the
machinery, quieter than the ventilation, quieter than the thermal
creaks. They were present in the same way that a current is present
beneath the surface of still water: invisible, but there, moving.

I heard them first as a texture — a quality in the silence that
was not quite silence, a granularity, as if the air itself had
developed a fine structure that my ears could almost resolve. I
stopped my playback and sat very still, and the laboratory was
quiet, and beneath the quiet the whispers moved.

They were voices. I am certain of this, though I know how it sounds
and I know what the rational explanations are and I have considered
all of them. They were voices — not human voices, not any voices
I had ever heard, but voices: organized sound, carrying pattern,
carrying what I can only call intention. They spoke in no language
I recognized. The phonemes — if they were phonemes — did not
correspond to any human language or any known alien communication
system. They were low, sibilant, overlapping, like many speakers
talking at once in a room too large to see across.

I reached for my recording equipment. My hands were shaking. I am
an acoustics engineer; I do not scare easily. Sound is my medium,
my professional domain, and I have always felt at home in it the
way a swimmer feels at home in water. But this sound — these
whispers — did not feel like home. They felt like something else.
They felt like something that was not meant for me, that I was
overhearing through some accident of geometry and stone, the way
you might overhear a conversation in a foreign language through a
wall in a hotel and know, without understanding the words, that
you are hearing something private.

I recorded. The spectrum analyzer showed nothing — or rather, it
showed the expected ambient frequencies and nothing else. The
whispers were not registering on my equipment.

I could hear them. I could hear them clearly. And my instruments
could not.

I sat in the laboratory and listened to voices that did not exist
on any frequency my equipment could measure, and I felt the stone
of the asteroid pressing in from all sides — four billion years of
stone, older than the Earth, older than most of the stars visible
from its surface — and I thought: the asteroid is talking.

And then I thought: no. The asteroid is not talking. The asteroid
is carrying. The way a wire carries a current, the way a bone
carries vibration to the inner ear. The stone is carrying something
that originated somewhere else, from someone else, and the
spherical cavity of the station is focusing it, amplifying it,
delivering it to the ears of three hundred and twelve human beings
who have built their lives inside a resonance chamber they do not
understand.

                               V.

I spent the next four days trying to prove myself wrong.

I moved sensors. I recalibrated equipment. I brought in additional
instruments — seismographs, magnetometers, devices designed to
measure vibration in solid media rather than in air. I drilled
microphone mounts into the stone walls of the cavity, pressing my
sensors directly against the asteroid's ancient iron-nickel flesh,
and I listened.

The stone was alive with sound.

Not the sounds of the station — not the hum of machinery or the
vibration of rotation. These were deeper sounds, slower sounds,
sounds that moved through the mineral matrix at frequencies far
below the range of human hearing. Infrasound. Vibrations measured
in millihertz, with wavelengths that stretched across the entire
diameter of the asteroid. They were not random. They were patterned
— complex, recursive, layered. They were, I realized with a
certainty that settled into my bones like cold water, the source
of the whispers.

The asteroid's iron-nickel composition was acting as a transducer.
The infrasonic vibrations in the stone were being up-converted —
shifted to higher frequencies by the interaction between the mineral
structure and the cavity's geometry — and projected into the
station's atmosphere as audible sound. The spherical cavity focused
them. The station's structures modulated them. And the human ear,
that exquisitely sensitive instrument, received them and interpreted
them as whispers.

But that explained only the mechanism. It did not explain the
source.

Where were the infrasonic vibrations coming from?

I traced them. It took me two days of careful measurement, moving
my sensors through the stone, following the vibrations like a man
following a river upstream. The vibrations were not originating from
within the asteroid. They were coming from outside — from the void,
transmitted through the asteroid's body the way sound is transmitted
through the hull of a submarine from the ocean outside. Something
was vibrating the asteroid. Something in space, something beyond
the station, was producing infrasonic waves of extraordinary
complexity and projecting them at — or through — the twelve-
kilometer sphere of iron and nickel that three hundred and twelve
people called home.

I could not determine the source. My equipment was not designed for
it. The vibrations came from every direction simultaneously, or
from no direction, or from a direction that my instruments could
not resolve. They were simply there — in the stone, in the walls,
in the floor beneath my feet — and they had been there, the
geological record suggested, for a very long time.

                              VI.

On my thirteenth day on Lithios, I attended a community meeting
called by Dr. Sow to discuss my findings. The meeting was held in
the station's central auditorium — a space carved from the
asteroid's stone, with curved walls that rose to a vaulted ceiling
of raw, unfinished rock. The acoustics, I could not help noting,
were extraordinary. The room was a natural amplifier.

Three hundred people attended. Their faces carried the particular
expression of people who have been living with something
unexplained for a long time and have developed a complex
relationship with their own uncertainty — part resignation, part
defiance, part the furtive hope that someone from the outside would
come and make it make sense.

I told them what I had found. The transduction mechanism. The
infrasonic source. The up-conversion through the cavity geometry.
I used diagrams. I was clear. I was thorough. And when I was
finished, a woman in the third row — a geologist named Ostrova,
who had been on the station for six years — raised her hand.

"You've told us how," she said. "You haven't told us what."

"I can't identify the source of the infrasonic vibrations," I said.
"My equipment—"

"That's not what I mean. You've told us how the sound gets into the
station. You haven't told us what the sound is. We've been hearing
these whispers for years, Mr. Fell. Some of us hear them every day.
They are not random noise. They have structure. They change. They
respond."

"Respond?"

"When we talk about them, they get louder."

The auditorium was very quiet. I looked at Dr. Sow, who was looking
at her hands.

"That could be a perceptual artifact," I said. "Heightened attention
to a stimulus—"

"I have recordings," Ostrova said. "Personal recordings, made over
three years. The whispers are not constant. They intensify when the
station population is concentrated — during meetings, during meals,
during social gatherings. They diminish when people disperse to
individual quarters. And they change. The patterns shift. New
elements appear. They are not a recording on a loop, Mr. Fell.
They are a conversation."

"A conversation with whom?"

"That," said Ostrova, "is the question."

The auditorium's stone walls curved above us, and the ceiling of
raw rock hung overhead like the vault of a skull, and the whispers
— because I could hear them now, because once you heard them you
always heard them, because they were always there beneath the
surface of every silence — the whispers continued, low and
sibilant and patient, and I stood at the podium and felt the stone
pressing in from all sides and understood, with a clarity that was
not rational but was absolutely certain, that Ostrova was right.

Something was speaking. Through the stone, through the void,
through four billion years of iron and nickel and silence. Something
was speaking, and the station — the hollow in the rock, the cavity
that humans had filled with light and air and the sound of their
own voices — was the ear through which it heard itself.

                             VII.

I stayed on Lithios for three more weeks. I documented everything.
I measured everything. I produced a report of four hundred and
seventeen pages that described the acoustic mechanism in exhaustive
technical detail and concluded, in the carefully hedged language of
a professional who is saying something he cannot prove, that the
infrasonic phenomena warranted further investigation by specialists
in fields beyond my own.

I did not say what I believed. My report was technical. My beliefs
were not.

What I believed — what I still believe, in the quiet hours of the
night when I lie in my own bed in my own apartment on Earth and
listen to the sounds of a world that is not hollow, not resonant,
not carrying anything in its stone except the deep indifferent
geology of a living planet — what I believe is this:

The asteroid is a receiver. The cavity is an antenna. The whispers
are a transmission — carried through the void on infrasonic
frequencies too low for any human instrument to trace to their
source, propagated through the mineral body of a four-billion-year-
old rock that has been drifting, by coincidence or design, through
the exact region of space where the signal is strongest.

Someone — something — is broadcasting. Has been broadcasting,
perhaps, since before the solar system formed. The signal fills
the void the way light fills a room — invisibly, pervasively,
from a source that cannot be located because it is everywhere or
because it is nowhere or because the concept of location does not
apply to whatever is speaking.

The humans on Lithios Station did not build a research outpost.
They built a cathedral. They hollowed a space in the stone, and
the stone, which had been carrying the whispers for four billion
years in silence, finally had a cavity in which to speak them.

I left Lithios on the twenty-seventh of April. The Karelian
undocked from the station's port and pulled away into the void,
and I watched the asteroid shrink in the viewport — a dark, lumpy
shape, unremarkable, indistinguishable from a million other
asteroids in the belt. But inside it, in the hollow that three
hundred and twelve people called home, the whispers continued. They
would always continue. They had been there before the station, before
the mining operation, before the solar system. They would be there
after.

On the journey home, I did not sleep well. The ship was quiet —
the normal quiet of a well-maintained vessel in transit, the hum
of engines, the whisper of air circulation. But I listened, as I
had learned to listen on Lithios, beneath the surface of the
sound, and I heard — or I imagined I heard, or I feared I heard —
something moving in the silence. A texture. A granularity. A
pattern that was not random, that carried intention, that was not
for me but that I could not stop hearing.

The universe, I have come to suspect, is not silent. It has never
been silent. We have merely been living in rooms too small to hear
what is being said.

I have applied for a return assignment to Lithios. My application
is pending.

I am listening.

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

REX DRUMMOND is the author of some of the most exciting space opera
this magazine — or any magazine — has published. A former bomber
pilot with the Eighth Air Force and a native of Midland, Texas, he
writes with a velocity and an exuberance that his readers have come
to cherish and his editor has learned to channel. "The Corsair of
the Crimson Nebula" is his longest story to date and his most
ambitious — a full novella that he describes as "the one I've been
building up to since I first put a spaceship on paper." His previous
adventures for these pages include "Blaze of the Outer Dark" (Issue
#5), "The Sword of Sirius" (Issue #29), and a dozen more. He lives
in Texas, smokes cigars, and wears cowboy boots to every public
appearance.

DOUGLAS PEMBERTON is our man in Woking, Surrey — the English
humorist who has made a second career of transplanting the comedy
of manners to the twenty-fifth century. A graduate of Balliol
College, Oxford, and a former Royal Navy man who cheerfully admits
to having been "spectacularly incompetent at everything except
making people laugh," he brings to science fiction a wit and a
formal elegance that the genre sorely needs. "The Patent Office at
the End of Time" is his most ambitious comedy — a legal drama set
at the heat death of the universe, starring God as defendant and
bureaucracy as setting. His previous stories include "The Automated
Valet" (Issue #8) and "The Conquest of Marsfield" (Issue #25). He
lives in Surrey with his wife Penelope, three dogs, two cats, a
parrot, and a tortoise named Doris.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of
this magazine, and "Crucible" may be his finest hour. A former
autoworker and current technical writer for General Motors in
Dearborn, Michigan, he has published a story in nearly every issue
since our first, demonstrating a versatility and a reliability that
are the envy of his peers. "Crucible" represents a departure —
a taut, claustrophobic moral drama with no aliens, no gadgets, and
nowhere to hide. We think it is the most powerful story he has
written. He writes every evening from 8:00 PM to midnight, seven
days a week, and his wife Jean has learned to sleep through the
sound of his typewriter.

MARGARET THORNTON is the magazine's foremost practitioner of
ecological science fiction — stories in which the living systems
of alien worlds are not backdrop but protagonist. A marine biologist
by training, she holds a master's degree from the University of
Washington and brings to her fiction a scientist's precision and a
poet's eye for the beauty of biological process. "The Greenhouse
Effect" is her most topical story — a tale of terraforming that
asks who is really in charge when humans bring life to a new world.
Her previous stories include "The Littoral Zone" (Issue #12),
"Greenfall" (Issue #1), and "Symbiosis" (Issue #21). She lives on
Orcas Island in the San Juan archipelago and carries a field
notebook everywhere.

GUNNAR ERIKSSON is a literary translator and fiction writer who
lives in Stockholm, Sweden, and writes in English with a beauty
and a melancholy that are entirely his own. His stories of deep
space — spare, contemplative, luminous — have earned him comparisons
to Bradbury and a devoted readership among those who believe that
science fiction can be literature. "Lighthouse at the Edge" is
a story about solitude, duty, and the moment when a light in the
darkness is finally answered. His previous stories include "The Long
Watch" (Issue #16), which prompted an admiring letter from Ray
Bradbury, and "The Wanderer's Rest" (Issue #20). He is married to
painter Ingrid Bergstrom, and they live quietly in Sodermalm.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY learned to write in the pulps, and he is proud
of it. A Chicago native who has been writing professional fiction
since 1939, he brings to science fiction the pure, undiluted
narrative energy of the old pulp tradition. "Tin Soldier" is a
departure for Finley — warmer, funnier, and more tender than his
usual high-velocity adventures — and it may surprise readers who
know him primarily as the author of "Crash Orbit" (Issue #2) and
"The Sting of Andromeda" (Issue #20). He reports that the story was
inspired by a combine harvester he once saw at a state fair and the
question: "What if that thing could think?" He lives in Rogers Park,
Chicago, with his wife Carol and an indeterminate number of cats.

LUCIAN MARSH is the magazine's resident master of the uncanny —
a writer who occupies the borderland between science fiction and
horror with a skill that is, frankly, unsettling. A recluse who
lives in rented rooms along the New England coast and communicates
almost exclusively by letter, he brings to his fiction an atmosphere
of creeping dread that no other writer in the field can match. "The
Whispering Gallery" is his most accomplished work for these pages —
a story that begins as an acoustic mystery and becomes something
far stranger and more disturbing. His previous stories include "The
Lighthouse at Ganymede" (Issue #11) and "Salvage Rights" (Issue
#27). He does not attend conventions, does not grant interviews,
and is rumored to own no fewer than four cats, though this has not
been independently verified.

                         SIGNALS RECEIVED
                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

Rex Drummond's "The Sword of Sirius" in Issue #29 was the most
purely entertaining story I have read in any magazine this year. I
devoured it in a single sitting and immediately turned back to page
one and read it again. Captain Drummond — I mean Captain Rennick —
is everything a space opera hero should be: dashing, brave, and just
clever enough to be believable. More Drummond, please. Much more.

                              — William J. Hendricks
                                 San Antonio, Texas

Dear Editor,

Margaret Thornton's "Symbiosis" (Issue #21) has stayed with me for
months. The image of the two organisms, each dependent on the other,
each transformed by the dependency — I have not read a more elegant
metaphor for the colonial relationship in any genre. Mrs. Thornton
(or is it Miss? Or Dr.?) writes about alien biology with a
specificity and a beauty that makes me want to go back to school.
More, please.

                              — Dr. Helen Okafor
                                 Department of Biology
                                 University of Lagos, Nigeria

(It is Ms. Thornton, and she holds a master's in marine biology
from the University of Washington. We shall pass along your
compliments and your implicit enrollment suggestion.      — M.S.)

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I wish to register a complaint. Your magazine is ruining my
sleep. I made the mistake of reading Lucian Marsh's "The Signal
from Below" (Issue #27) before bed, and I did not sleep properly
for three nights. The passage where the narrator descends into the
abandoned section of the station and hears the breathing — I cannot
get it out of my head. I have checked my own basement twice.
Please print more Marsh, but perhaps with a warning label.

                              — Mrs. Eleanor Finch
                                 Brattleboro, Vermont

(We sympathize, Mrs. Finch, and can report that Mr. Marsh has
a new story in this very issue. We recommend reading it in
daylight, with company nearby.                            — M.S.)

Dear Sterling,

I am a structural engineer, and I have been reading Theodore Cain's
stories since your first issue. He is not flashy, he is not
experimental, and he will probably never win any of the awards that
seem to go to writers who confuse obscurity with depth. What he is,
consistently and without fail, is good. "Counterfeit Cosmos" in
Issue #20 was a thoroughly entertaining mystery. "Assembly Line" in
Issue #15 made me think about my own work in ways I had not
expected. Keep Mr. Cain writing. He is the best reason to buy your
magazine every month.

                              — James Braddock, P.E.
                                 Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

We are honored by these letters and grateful for your engagement.
Keep writing!                                              — M.S.

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

LONG TOMORROW by Leigh Brackett
(Doubleday, 1955, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Leigh Brackett — known to many readers as the queen of planetary
romance — has produced something unexpected: a sober, thoughtful,
and deeply unsettling novel about the aftermath of nuclear war.
Set in a future America where technology has been outlawed and the
survivors live in agrarian communities governed by a constitutional
amendment prohibiting cities, "Long Tomorrow" follows two
cousins who quest for a rumored underground city where science
still lives. Brackett writes the post-apocalyptic landscape with
the same vivid authority she brings to Mars and Venus, and the
moral questions — is technology salvation or damnation? can humanity
be trusted with its own inventions? — are posed with an intelligence
that elevates the novel well above the usual atomic doom narratives.
If the ending is somewhat ambiguous, that is, I think, the point.
Highly recommended.

TUNNEL IN THE SKY by Robert A. Heinlein
(Scribner's, 1955, $2.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Heinlein continues his remarkable series of juvenile novels with
this gripping tale of a group of students stranded on an alien world
during a survival test gone wrong. The premise is essentially "Lord
of the Flies" in space, but Heinlein, characteristically, is more
optimistic about human nature than Golding: his young survivors
build a functioning community rather than descending into savagery,
and the novel's real interest lies in the practical challenges of
colonization — food, shelter, governance, the negotiation of social
order under pressure. It is a Heinlein juvenile, which means it is
well-plotted, fast-paced, and contains more genuine ideas per page
than most adult novels. The protagonist, Rod Walker, is one of
Heinlein's most engaging young heroes. Recommended with enthusiasm
for readers of all ages.

THE MARAUDERS by Murray Leinster
(Gnome Press, 1955, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Murray Leinster, who has been a reliable producer of solid,
entertaining science fiction since before most of his current readers
were born, delivers another competent adventure in "The Marauders."
The plot concerns a crew of space miners who must defend their claim
against pirates while dealing with an alien life form that may be
more dangerous than either party realizes. The science is sound, the
pace is brisk, and the twist involving the alien organism is
genuinely surprising. If the characterization is somewhat thin and
the prose occasionally functional rather than inspired, these are
minor complaints against a thoroughly enjoyable novel by a master of
the craft. Recommended for a pleasant afternoon's reading.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #31 — July 1955

We are pleased to announce the contents of our thirty-first issue:

"CHROMATIC ABERRATION" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A deep-space telescope
detects a star whose light does not behave according to known physics.
The astronomer assigned to investigate discovers that the anomaly is
not an error in the instrument but an error in the universe. Koslov
at his most rigorous and most unsettling.

"THE SECOND COMMISSIONING" by Harold "Hal" Mercer — The first space
elevator, thirty years after construction, needs repair. The
engineer who built it is retired, reluctant, and the only person
alive who understands the original design. Mercer returns to the
mega-engineering that made his name.

"BORROWED TIME" by Theodore Cain — A temporal agent discovers that
the past he has been sent to protect has already been changed — by
himself, in a future he hasn't lived yet. Cain's most inventive
time-travel story.

"SILK AND VENOM" by Agnes Whitfield — An arachnologist on an alien
world discovers that the local spider analogue's silk has properties
that could revolutionize medicine — if the spiders can be persuaded
to cooperate. Whitfield brings her characteristic blend of wonder
and unease.

Plus: a new story by Franklin Hoyt, letters from our readers, book
reviews, and more.
