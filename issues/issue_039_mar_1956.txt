TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

We are, all of us, builders and destroyers. I do not mean this as metaphor
— or rather, I do not mean it only as metaphor. I mean it as a fundamental
observation about the species. We are the animal that raises cathedrals
and then sets fire to them. We are the civilization that invents concrete
and dynamite with roughly equal enthusiasm. We lay foundations and we swing
wrecking balls, and if you press us on why, we will tell you with perfect
sincerity that both are necessary.

This issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond is, I confess, a meditation
on that duality — the twin impulses that drive civilization forward and
tear it apart. I did not set out to build a themed issue. But when I
assembled the stories that had accumulated on my desk over the past several
months, I found that they spoke to each other in ways I had not planned.
They were all, in their various idioms and registers, asking the same
question: What does it mean to build? What does it mean to take apart?
And is there, somewhere in the space between those acts, a meaning that
neither alone can provide?

Hal Mercer opens our pages with the largest construction project in human
history — a wall across the solar system itself, built from comets and
ice to shield us from the void. It is Mercer at his most ambitious, and
that is saying something. Rex Drummond follows with a demolition job that
goes spectacularly wrong, in the way that Drummond's assignments always
go spectacularly wrong, to our great delight and his characters' great
distress. Agnes Whitfield gives us a woman building a house on a world
where reality itself cannot be trusted — a story so quiet and so powerful
that I found myself rereading it twice before I could bring myself to send
it to the typesetter. Theodore Cain delivers a thriller about a fatal
flaw in a perfect building, and the confession that explains it. Franklin
Hoyt asks what happens when a perfectly rational society decides that
civilization is no longer worth the effort — a story that will make you
argue with your friends, which is exactly what Hoyt intends. Dr. Vincent
Koslov gives us a furnace that burns at stellar temperatures and the
element it creates — Promethean myth dressed in laboratory whites. And
Danny Kowalski closes the issue with a child's drawing that contains a
secret the universe was keeping.

Seven stories. Seven acts of building, of breaking, of making something
new from the rubble. I am proud of every one.

We received a record number of letters last month, and I have printed as
many as space allows. Keep writing. Tell us when we are wrong, tell us
when we are right, and tell us what you want to see in these pages. This
magazine belongs to you as much as it does to us.

Build something today. Even if someone tears it down tomorrow.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond

                        GREAT WALL OF SOL

                    by Harold "Hal" Mercer

================================================================================

                               I.

The comet arrived on schedule, which was the only thing that went right
that day.

Amara Okoye stood in the observation gallery of Farwatch Station, three
hundred astronomical units from the sun, and watched the chunk of ice and
rock drift into position on the construction grid. It was a medium-sized
body — roughly eleven kilometers on its long axis, five on the short —
and it had been nudged out of its natural orbit in the Oort Cloud four
months ago by a constellation of gravity tugs working in tandem. The tugs
were still attached, their ion drives casting faint blue halos against
the body's dark surface, making micro-corrections as they eased the comet
into alignment with the seven hundred and twelve other bodies already
locked into the grid.

Seven hundred and thirteen, now.

"Grid lock confirmed on body seven-one-three," said Tomás Reyes from the
operations console behind her. He was her chief construction engineer, a
compact man from Ecuador with twenty years of deep-space construction
experience and a voice that remained precisely the same whether he was
reporting nominal status or catastrophic failure. "Drift is within
tolerance. Fusing sequence can begin on your mark."

"Hold fusing," Okoye said. She pressed her fingers against the gallery
window — not glass but a composite three centimeters thick that could
withstand a micrometeorite strike — and studied the grid.

The Wall.

From this vantage point, it looked like a vast, irregular mosaic laid
against the absolute darkness of interstellar space. Each tile was a
comet or asteroid, some as small as a few hundred meters across, others
stretching dozens of kilometers. They had been brought here from across
the Oort Cloud, selected for composition and structural integrity, and
arranged in an interlocking pattern that the engineering team called the
"honeycomb" — each body fitted against its neighbors, the gaps between
them filled with a matrix of water ice and silicate dust fused into a
rigid lattice by directed-energy beams.

The Wall was currently four thousand six hundred kilometers across and
growing by an average of twelve kilometers per day. When complete, it
would be nine thousand kilometers in diameter — roughly the width of the
Earth — and positioned directly in the path of the Alderson Cloud.

The Alderson Cloud. Even after two years of working to stop it, Okoye
found the name inadequate. It was named for the astronomer who had
discovered it — Patricia Alderson, at the Mauna Kea Observatory, in 2031
— and it was not, strictly speaking, a cloud. It was a dense stream of
interstellar debris: dust, ice, rock, and shattered remnants of cometary
bodies, stretching across twelve light-years of space and traveling at
roughly six hundred kilometers per second relative to the sun. It was not
large by interstellar standards. It was not even particularly unusual.
The galaxy was full of such streams, the litter of ancient stellar
collisions and supernova shocks, drifting through space on timescales
that made human history look like a blink.

But this particular stream was aimed at the solar system. Not at the
Earth specifically — the targeting was far broader than that. The leading
edge of the cloud, when it arrived, would sweep through the entire inner
solar system over a period of approximately nine years, bombarding every
planet, every moon, every orbital station, and every asteroid mining
colony with a sustained barrage of high-velocity debris. The models
varied in their severity. The optimistic projections estimated casualties
in the tens of millions. The pessimistic projections did not bother with
numbers.

The leading edge was twelve years away. Okoye had been given ten years to
build the Wall.

She was in year two, and she was behind schedule.

"What's the structural assessment on seven-one-three?" she asked.

Reyes consulted his display. "Composition is consistent with the survey
data. Seventy-two percent water ice, eighteen percent silicate, ten
percent organics. Structural integrity is nominal. Fusing protocols are
standard."

"And the bodies adjacent?"

"Seven-one-one and seven-one-two are fully locked and fused. Seven-one-
four is on approach — ETA six hours."

Okoye nodded. The process was relentless. Every day, new bodies arrived.
Every day, the fusing crews welded them into the lattice. Every day, the
Wall grew. And every day, the Alderson Cloud was twelve hours closer.

"Begin fusing," she said.

Through the gallery window, she watched the directed-energy beams ignite
— pale blue lances that played across the contact surfaces between body
713 and its neighbors, heating the ice and rock to their melting points,
allowing them to flow together and then refreeze into a unified mass. The
process took forty minutes per junction. Body 713 had nine junctions. By
this time tomorrow, it would be part of the Wall, indistinguishable from
the structure around it.

One more tile in a mosaic the size of a world.

                               * * *

The operations center of Farwatch Station was a large, circular room
dominated by a holographic display table that showed the Wall in
three-dimensional miniature — a curved disk of interlocking bodies,
slowly rotating, with color-coded indicators showing construction status,
structural integrity, and projected growth rates. Around the table, a
dozen engineers and technicians worked at consoles, monitoring the
hundreds of simultaneous operations that kept the project moving.

Okoye stood at the table's edge and studied the growth projections. The
numbers were not good.

"We're running seventeen percent behind the revised schedule," said
Dr. Lian Zhou, her chief structural analyst, a tall woman from Shanghai
with a habit of delivering bad news in the same matter-of-fact tone one
might use to order lunch. "The primary bottleneck is gravity tug
availability. We have sixty-four tugs operational, and we need at least
eighty to maintain the projected delivery rate."

"The last shipment from the inner system was supposed to include twelve
new tugs," Okoye said.

"It included eight. Four were diverted to the Ceres station for routine
maintenance on the asteroid mining infrastructure."

"Routine maintenance."

"That is what the manifest says."

Okoye felt the familiar tightness in her jaw that accompanied
bureaucratic frustration. The Wall was the largest construction project in
human history, funded by a consortium of every government on Earth and
authorized by a unanimous vote of the United Nations General Assembly.
And still — still — she had to fight for equipment. The inner system had
its own priorities, its own budgets, its own politics. The fact that
those politics might become irrelevant if the Alderson Cloud arrived and
they were all dead did not, apparently, carry sufficient weight in the
allocation meetings.

"I'll take it up with the Consortium board," she said. "Again."

"There is another issue," Zhou said. She touched the display, and a
section of the Wall's lower quadrant pulsed red. "Sector Fourteen.
We've detected anomalous stress readings in a cluster of fused bodies
near the southern edge. The readings suggest a subsurface fracture in
body six-two-nine — one of the early placements."

"How bad?"

"If the fracture propagates, we could lose structural integrity across a
section approximately two hundred kilometers wide. That section would
need to be rebuilt."

"Rebuilt."

"Extracted, replaced, and re-fused. Estimated setback: three weeks."

Okoye stared at the red section on the display. Three weeks. She did not
have three weeks. She barely had three days. Every delay cascaded forward,
pushing the completion date closer to the cloud's arrival, narrowing the
already thin margin between done and not done.

"Send an inspection crew to Sector Fourteen," she said. "Full diagnostic.
I want to know the exact extent of the fracture and whether it can be
repaired in place."

"Understood."

"And Zhou? The next time someone in the inner system diverts my
equipment, I want to know about it before it happens, not after."

Zhou allowed herself a thin smile. "I will endeavor to intercept the
paperwork."

                               II.

The message came in at 0300 station time, routed through the secure
channel reserved for communications from the Consortium Board of
Directors in Geneva. Okoye was asleep when it arrived. She was not asleep
for long.

"Director Okoye," the message began. It was text only, marked PRIORITY
ALPHA. "We have received intelligence from the Security Directorate
indicating a credible threat to the Wall project. A group identifying
itself as the Outer Sovereignty Movement has claimed responsibility for
acts of sabotage against project infrastructure, including the disruption
of gravity tug supply lines and the possible compromise of construction
materials. The Security Directorate assesses this threat as serious. A
security liaison team will arrive at Farwatch Station within seventy-two
hours. You are instructed to cooperate fully with this team and to
implement enhanced security protocols immediately. Details follow."

Okoye read the message twice. Then she got dressed, went to the
operations center, and called a senior staff meeting.

They gathered around the holographic table at 0400 — Okoye, Reyes, Zhou,
Chief of Security Priya Nair, Communications Officer Henrik Dahl, and
Dr. James Okoro, the project's chief scientist and the man responsible
for the physical models that determined where each body needed to be
placed for maximum shielding effect.

Okoye briefed them on the message. When she finished, the room was
quiet for a moment.

"The Outer Sovereignty Movement," Nair said. She was a small, precise
woman who had spent fifteen years in the Indian Space Defense Force
before transferring to civilian security work. "I've read their
manifestos. They believe the Wall is not a shield. They believe it's a
weapon."

"A weapon," Reyes said. "A wall of frozen comets."

"Their argument is that the directed-energy infrastructure being built
to fuse the Wall could be reconfigured as a weapons array — that the
Wall is, in effect, a massive orbital gun platform aimed outward toward
the stars. They believe the Alderson Cloud threat has been exaggerated
or fabricated to justify the construction of a military installation in
the outer system."

"That's insane," said Okoro, who was a mild man but felt strongly about
the integrity of his data. "The Alderson Cloud is the most thoroughly
documented astronomical phenomenon of the century. Every major
observatory on Earth and in space has confirmed its trajectory, its
composition, and its velocity. The threat models have been peer-reviewed
by—"

"I am not endorsing their position," Nair said. "I am explaining it.
These people are not interested in peer review. They are interested in
sovereignty. Their core belief is that the inner system governments are
using the Wall project to extend military control into the outer system
— their territory, as they see it."

"Their territory," Okoye said. "The Oort Cloud."

"They have a point, legally speaking," Nair said. "The Outer System
Treaty of 2028 established that territories beyond the Kuiper Belt are
not subject to any single nation's jurisdiction. The Wall project
operates under a Consortium mandate, but the Consortium is dominated by
inner-system governments. The OSM sees this as colonial expansion."

"I don't care what they see it as," Okoye said, and the flatness of
her voice made the room go very still. "I care about the Wall. What
kind of sabotage are we talking about?"

"The intelligence report mentions three categories," Nair said.
"Supply line disruption — which may explain some of our equipment
shortages. Material compromise — the introduction of structurally
deficient bodies into the construction stream, which could create
hidden weaknesses in the Wall. And direct action — physical attacks on
project infrastructure."

"Body six-two-nine," Zhou said quietly.

Everyone looked at her.

"The fracture in Sector Fourteen," she said. "I assumed it was natural
— a stress failure in the ice matrix. But if someone deliberately
introduced a compromised body into the construction stream..."

"We'd need to verify," Okoye said. "How?"

"Deep scan. Spectral analysis of the fracture surfaces. If the body
was weakened deliberately — drilled, heated, chemically treated — there
will be signatures."

"Do it. Today."

                               III.

The inspection crew reached Sector Fourteen at 0900 and reported back
by noon. The news was not good.

"It's sabotage," Zhou said, standing at the holographic table with the
scan results displayed before her. The fracture surfaces were shown in
enhanced color — false-color spectral images that revealed, with
damning clarity, a series of bore holes drilled into the body's
interior and filled with a compound that, over time, had weakened the
ice matrix from within. The compound was ammonium nitrate — a common
industrial chemical, readily available on any mining station, and
utterly out of place inside a comet body.

"Someone drilled into this body before it was placed," Zhou continued.
"They packed the bore holes with a slow-acting destabilizer and sealed
the entry points. It was designed to fail gradually, over weeks or
months, so the structural collapse would look natural."

"And we wouldn't know the Wall had a weak point until the Cloud
arrived and punched through it," Okoye said.

"Precisely."

Okoye looked around the table. The faces were grim. Reyes, who rarely
showed emotion, had a muscle working in his jaw. Nair was already
making notes on her tablet, her expression focused and cold. Okoro
looked stricken — the idea that someone had corrupted the data, had
turned his carefully calculated placements into vulnerabilities, was
a violation that went deeper than politics for him.

"How many other bodies could be compromised?" Okoye asked.

Zhou hesitated. "We've placed seven hundred and thirteen bodies. If
the saboteurs had access to the construction stream at any point in
the past two years, the answer is: any of them. All of them."

"We'd have to scan every body in the Wall."

"Yes."

"How long?"

"With our current scanning equipment, operating around the clock —
approximately eight months."

The number landed in the room like a dropped wrench. Eight months.
They were already behind schedule. An eight-month scanning operation
would effectively halt new construction, or at best slow it to a
crawl. The completion date would slip past the cloud's arrival. The
Wall would not be finished in time.

Okoye was quiet for a long moment. She stood at the table, her hands
flat on its surface, her eyes on the rotating image of the Wall — her
Wall, the thing she had been building for two years, the thing that
stood between every human being alive and the indifferent violence of
the interstellar medium.

"We're not stopping construction," she said.

"Director—" Zhou began.

"We're not stopping. We scan while we build. Split the crews. Half on
construction, half on inspection. Reyes, I need you to redesign the
work schedules — double shifts, staggered rotations, whatever it takes
to keep both operations running simultaneously."

"That will put enormous strain on the crews," Reyes said.

"I know. Talk to them. Explain the situation. Every person on this
station volunteered for this project because they understood what was
at stake. Trust them to understand this too."

"And the compromised bodies?" Nair asked.

"Every body that scans dirty gets extracted and replaced. Zhou, I want
a priority list — which sections are most critical to the Wall's
structural integrity? We scan those first."

"I'll have it by tonight."

"Nair, I want the security team expanded. I want background checks on
every crew member, every tug pilot, every contractor who's been within
fifty AU of this station. And I want to know how the compromised
bodies got into the construction stream. Someone had physical access
to those bodies between the time they were surveyed and the time they
were placed. Find out who."

"Understood."

Okoye straightened up. She was a tall woman — one hundred and eighty
centimeters — with close-cropped hair and the broad shoulders of
someone who had spent her early career doing physical construction work
in orbital habitats. Her face was angular and striking, the face of a
woman who made decisions quickly and did not revisit them. She had been
born in Lagos, educated at MIT, and had built bridges, stations, and
habitats across the inner system before being chosen to lead the
largest engineering project in human history. She was forty-seven
years old, and she had not seen her family on Earth in two years.

"One more thing," she said. "I'm calling Geneva. I'm requesting
authorization to arm this station."

The room went very quiet.

"We're a construction project," Reyes said. "Not a military
installation."

"We're a construction project that is under attack. I'm not going to
wait for someone to blow a hole in the Wall while I'm filling out
requisition forms."

She left the operations center and walked to her office — a small
compartment with a desk, a chair, and a window that looked out on the
Wall. She sat down, opened the secure channel to Geneva, and began
composing her message.

Through the window, the Wall stretched across the darkness, massive
and incomplete. A monument to human stubbornness and engineering skill,
growing one comet at a time, against the clock.

She would finish it. She had to finish it. There was no second option.

                               IV.

The security liaison team arrived three days later aboard a fast
courier from the inner system: a ship that had burned at high-g for
the entire transit and arrived with its crew looking gray and
compressed. The team leader was a woman named Colonel Ada Osei,
Ghanaian-born, career military intelligence, with a reputation for
being thorough, uncompromising, and almost entirely devoid of small
talk.

Okoye met her at the docking bay. They shook hands.

"Director Okoye. I've read your file. Impressive construction record."

"Colonel Osei. I've read yours. Impressive arrest record."

Osei almost smiled. "I'm told you've already identified one compromised
body."

"One confirmed. We're scanning the rest. It's going to take time."

"Show me."

Okoye showed her. They spent four hours in the operations center,
reviewing the scan data, the construction logs, the personnel records.
Osei asked questions — many questions, specific questions, questions
that revealed a mind accustomed to finding patterns in noise. She was
particularly interested in the supply chain: the sequence of events
between a body being identified in the Oort Cloud, surveyed, selected
for construction, transported to the grid, and fused into the Wall.

"Your supply chain has thirty-seven discrete steps," Osei said, at the
end of the review. "The body could have been compromised at any of
twelve of those steps. That's too many vulnerability points."

"We designed the supply chain for efficiency, not security," Okoye
said. "When the project started, nobody expected sabotage."

"Somebody should have."

Okoye let the rebuke pass. She had thought the same thing herself, in
the small hours of the night.

"My team will need access to everything," Osei said. "Personnel
files, comm logs, transport manifests, docking records. Everything."

"You'll have it."

"And I'll need to interview your crew. All of them."

"All fifteen hundred?"

"We'll start with anyone who had physical access to the bodies between
survey and placement. That should narrow it down."

"To about three hundred."

"Then we start with three hundred."

                               * * *

The interviews began the next morning and continued for two weeks. Osei
and her team were methodical and relentless, working through the crew
in groups of twenty, cross-referencing testimony against the logs,
building a picture of who had been where and when.

The work of the station continued around them. Construction proceeded
at reduced speed — the split between building and scanning had cut the
placement rate by nearly half, and Okoye watched the growth
projections slide further behind schedule with each passing day. The
scanning crews found two more compromised bodies in the first week,
both in Sector Fourteen. The sabotage pattern was consistent:
bore holes, ammonium nitrate, sealed entry points. Whoever had done
this knew what they were doing.

On the ninth day, Osei came to Okoye's office.

"We have a lead," she said. She sat down across from Okoye's desk
without being invited — a habit of hers. "Three of the compromised
bodies passed through a secondary staging point called Depot Seven,
approximately forty AU from here. It's a small facility — six crew,
used as a waystation for bodies in transit from the outer cloud. All
three compromised bodies were processed through Depot Seven during the
same three-month period."

"Who's stationed there?"

"Six crew, rotating on ninety-day cycles. During the relevant period,
the station chief was a man named Mikhail Volkov. Russian-born,
naturalized Consortium citizen, twelve years of deep-space experience.
Clean record."

"But."

"But his communications logs show encrypted transmissions to a relay
node in the outer Kuiper Belt that does not appear on any official
network map. The transmissions began four months before the first
compromised body was processed through his depot."

Okoye leaned back in her chair. "Can you decrypt them?"

"Working on it. In the meantime, I've ordered Volkov brought here for
questioning. He arrives tomorrow."

"And if he's not working alone?"

"He almost certainly is not. The OSM is a distributed organization —
cells, not hierarchy. Volkov is probably one node in a network. If we
can get him to talk, we can find the others."

"And if he doesn't talk?"

Osei's expression did not change. "Everyone talks, Director. The
question is how long it takes."

                               V.

Mikhail Volkov arrived at Farwatch Station the following afternoon
under escort. He was a thin, quiet man in his mid-fifties with
pale eyes and the slightly hunched posture of someone who had spent
too many years in low-gravity environments. He did not resist. He
did not protest. He sat in the interview room with his hands folded
on the table and waited.

Okoye watched the interview from the observation room next door,
through a one-way window. She did not like watching interrogations.
She was an engineer, not an intelligence officer. But this was her
project, and these were her people, and she needed to understand
what was happening.

Osei sat across from Volkov and placed a tablet on the table between
them.

"Mr. Volkov. You know why you're here."

"I can guess."

"The encrypted transmissions. Who were you communicating with?"

Volkov was silent for a moment. Then he unfolded his hands and laid
them flat on the table, palms down, and looked directly at Osei.

"I will tell you everything," he said. "But first, I want Director
Okoye to understand something."

He looked at the one-way window. He could not see Okoye, but he
knew she was there.

"I do not want the Wall to fail," he said. "I want it to be what it
was promised to be — a shield. Not a weapon. That is all any of us
want."

"Then why sabotage it?" Osei asked.

"Because a shield that can be turned into a weapon is not a shield.
It is a threat. And threats must be opposed."

He talked for three hours. The story that emerged was at once
familiar and infuriating. The OSM was not a fringe group of cranks
and anarchists, as the inner-system media portrayed them. It was a
loose coalition of outer-system workers, scientists, and settlers
who had watched the Wall project with growing alarm — not because
they doubted the Alderson Cloud, but because they had seen the
engineering specifications for the directed-energy systems that were
being installed as part of the fusing infrastructure.

Those systems — the beams that melted ice and rock into a unified
structure — were powerful. Far more powerful than the fusing operation
alone required. The specifications called for energy outputs that
could, with relatively minor modifications, be reconfigured as
weapons. The OSM had obtained these specifications through a
sympathizer in the Consortium's engineering division and had concluded
that the Wall was being designed with a dual purpose: shield first,
weapon second.

"Your fusing arrays have a maximum output of forty terawatts per
beam," Volkov said. "Fusing operations require a maximum of eight.
Why is the system rated for five times its operational requirement?"

Okoye, watching from the observation room, felt a cold weight settle
in her stomach. She knew the answer. She had asked the same question
herself, two years ago, when she had first reviewed the engineering
specifications. The Consortium's response had been that the excess
capacity was a safety margin — that the fusing operations might
encounter unusually dense or refractory materials that required
higher energy inputs.

She had accepted that explanation. It had seemed reasonable.

Now, watching Volkov's quiet, determined face through the glass, she
was no longer certain.

                               VI.

Okoye spent the next forty-eight hours in her office, reviewing the
engineering specifications with fresh eyes.

The excess capacity in the fusing arrays was real. Forty terawatts per
beam, thirty-two beams, positioned around the Wall's circumference —
a total of over a petawatt of directed energy, most of it surplus to
the project's stated requirements. The power generation systems were
similarly oversized: the fusion reactors feeding the arrays were rated
for outputs that far exceeded the construction budget's energy
projections.

She ran the numbers. She was an engineer; numbers were her language.
The excess capacity could, in theory, be redirected. Not easily — the
beams were designed for short-range fusing operations, not long-range
targeting — but the modifications were not impossible. A team of
competent engineers, given six months and access to the system
architecture, could reconfigure the fusing arrays into a weapons
platform capable of directing concentrated energy at targets across
a significant volume of space.

A wall that was also a gun.

She sat at her desk and stared at the numbers on her screen. She was
a builder. She had been a builder her entire life — bridges, stations,
habitats, and now this, the Wall, the largest thing any human being
had ever constructed. She had taken this project because she believed
in it. Because the Alderson Cloud was real and the threat was real
and the Wall was the only thing standing between humanity and a slow-
motion catastrophe.

But if the Wall was also a weapon — if the governments that funded it
intended, once the cloud had passed, to retain a military installation
in the outer system — then Volkov was right. The shield was also a
threat. And every person who lived beyond the Kuiper Belt had reason
to fear it.

She picked up the secure comm and called Geneva.

The call took eighteen hours, round-trip, with lightspeed delay. She
used the time to prepare.

                               * * *

The response came from Consortium Director Elodie Marchetti, a
French diplomat who chaired the board with the cool efficiency of a
woman accustomed to managing crises by committee.

"Director Okoye. We have received your inquiry regarding the fusing
array specifications. The excess capacity is, as you were informed at
the outset, a safety margin. The engineering division has confirmed
this. I understand your concern, but I must remind you that the
security situation requires your full attention to construction
progress, not to speculation about system design."

Okoye listened to the message twice. Then she composed her reply.

"Director Marchetti. With respect, a safety margin of five-to-one is
not a safety margin. It is a capability. I need a direct answer to a
direct question: does the Consortium intend to retain the Wall's
energy infrastructure after the Alderson Cloud has passed?"

The reply took another eighteen hours.

"Director Okoye. The Consortium's post-cloud plans are not within
the scope of your operational authority. Your mandate is to complete
the Wall within the specified timeline. Please focus your efforts
accordingly."

Okoye read the non-answer and understood it perfectly. She had built
things for governments before. She knew what a non-answer meant.

                               VII.

She called a meeting of her senior staff. Not in the operations
center — in the station's mess hall, after hours, with the doors
shut. It was an unusual choice, and the staff noticed.

"I'm going to tell you something," she said, standing at the head
of a long table around which sat Reyes, Zhou, Nair, Okoro, Dahl,
and four other section chiefs. "And then I'm going to ask you to
help me do something that the Consortium board has not authorized."

She told them about the fusing array specifications. She showed them
the numbers. She showed them Geneva's non-answer.

When she finished, Reyes was the first to speak.

"You're saying the saboteurs might have a point."

"I'm saying they have a legitimate concern that has been met with
evasion. I am not saying that sabotage is the right response. Sabotage
endangers every person in the solar system. But the concern is real,
and if we don't address it, someone else will — and their methods
will be worse."

"What are you proposing?" Zhou asked.

"A redesign. We modify the fusing array architecture so that the
excess capacity cannot be weaponized. We reduce the maximum output
to twelve terawatts per beam — fifty percent above operational
requirements, which is a genuine safety margin — and we hardwire the
reduction into the system. Not software. Hardware. Physical limiters
that cannot be removed without disassembling the entire array."

"Geneva won't authorize that," Nair said.

"Geneva won't know about it until it's done."

The silence that followed was very thorough.

"You're talking about insubordination," Nair said, slowly.

"I'm talking about building a shield that is only a shield. I was
hired to build a wall, not a weapon. If the Consortium wants a
weapons platform, they can build it themselves, somewhere else, on
their own time."

She looked around the table. "I need to know if you're with me. All
of you. This has to be unanimous, or it doesn't happen."

Reyes leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms. He was quiet
for a moment — a moment that stretched until Okoye could hear the
ventilation system cycling.

"I came out here to build something," he said, finally. "Something
worth building. Something I could tell my daughters about. I'm not
building a gun." He unfolded his arms. "I'm with you."

Zhou nodded. Okoro nodded. Dahl nodded. Nair was last, and she took
the longest, and her face was the hardest to read. But in the end,
she nodded too.

"Then we start tonight," Okoye said. "Zhou, I need revised
specifications for the limiter hardware. Reyes, I need fabrication
schedules. Nair, I need you to ensure that our communications with
Geneva don't include any details about the modifications until they're
complete."

"And Osei?" Nair asked. "She's Consortium military intelligence. She's
going to notice."

"I'll handle Osei," Okoye said.

                               VIII.

She found Osei in the station's small gymnasium at 2200, running on a
treadmill at a pace that suggested either exceptional fitness or
serious anger. Okoye waited until she finished, then handed her a
water bottle and said, "I need to talk to you."

They sat on a bench by the viewport. The Wall filled the sky outside,
a dark mosaic against deeper darkness. Somewhere out there, beyond
the Wall, the Alderson Cloud was coming — invisible, patient,
indifferent.

Okoye told Osei everything. The array specifications. The excess
capacity. Geneva's evasion. The planned modifications.

Osei listened without interrupting. When Okoye finished, Osei was
quiet for a long time, her water bottle held loosely in one hand,
her eyes on the Wall.

"You know I should report this," Osei said.

"I know."

"My mandate is to protect the project. What you're describing could
be interpreted as compromising the project."

"My mandate is to build a shield. That's what I'm doing. I'm making
sure that's all it ever is."

Osei looked at her. Her face was neutral, but something moved behind
her eyes — something that Okoye recognized, because she had felt it
herself: the slow, grinding conflict between duty and judgment, between
orders and conscience.

"Volkov's people will keep sabotaging if they think the Wall is a
weapon," Osei said.

"Yes."

"And if the Wall isn't finished in time, everyone dies."

"Yes."

"So you're proposing to remove their reason for sabotage by removing
the thing they're afraid of."

"Yes."

Osei set her water bottle on the bench beside her. She stared at it
for a moment, as though it contained a very complicated problem.

"I need twenty-four hours," she said. "Don't start the modifications
until I give you a signal."

"What kind of signal?"

"You'll know."

                               * * *

The signal came the next morning, in the form of Osei walking into
the operations center and announcing, in her flat, professional
voice, that her security assessment of the station was complete and
that she had found no evidence of internal collaboration with the
OSM. She recommended that the station return to full construction
operations immediately and that the scanning program be accelerated
using a statistical sampling method rather than the exhaustive
body-by-body approach.

"Additionally," she said, looking directly at Okoye, "I recommend
that the station's engineering staff conduct a comprehensive review
of all energy systems to ensure they are optimized for their stated
purpose. Any excess capacity that is not required for construction
operations should be eliminated to reduce power consumption and
improve efficiency."

It was, Okoye reflected, the most beautifully bureaucratic
authorization she had ever received.

"Thank you, Colonel," she said. "We'll begin immediately."

                               IX.

The modifications took three months. They were conducted alongside
ongoing construction, which continued at an accelerating pace as the
scanning program cleared sections of the Wall and released crews
back to building. The statistical sampling method identified four
more compromised bodies — all processed through Depot Seven during
Volkov's tenure — and all were extracted and replaced without
significant delay.

The limiter hardware was fabricated on-station from standard
materials: tungsten carbide housings, ceramic insulators, mechanical
interlocks that physically prevented the fusing arrays from exceeding
twelve terawatts. Each limiter was the size of a briefcase and
weighed approximately forty kilograms. Installing them required
taking each array offline for six hours — a process that Reyes
scheduled into the regular maintenance rotation so smoothly that
no one outside the senior staff noticed anything unusual.

When the last limiter was installed, Okoye stood in the gallery
and looked at the Wall. It was six thousand kilometers across now,
more than halfway to completion. The fusing arrays glowed with their
pale blue light, welding ice to rock, building the shield one body
at a time.

A shield. Only a shield. A wall, not a weapon.

She opened a channel to the outer system — a broad-spectrum broadcast
that anyone with a receiver could pick up.

"This is Director Amara Okoye, Farwatch Station, Wall Project
Command. I am transmitting the engineering specifications for the
Wall's directed-energy systems as they now stand, including all
recent modifications. These specifications are being made available
to all interested parties in the outer system. The fusing arrays
have been physically limited to a maximum output of twelve terawatts
per beam — sufficient for construction, insufficient for weapons
applications. This limitation is hardwired and cannot be reversed
without disassembling the arrays.

"The Wall is a shield. It was always meant to be a shield. We are
building it to protect everyone in the solar system — inner and
outer, Earth-born and space-born, citizen and settler. If there are
those among you who doubted this, I hope this transmission
addresses your concerns. If there are those among you who have been
working to stop us, I ask you to stop. We have eight years to finish
this Wall. We need every hand, and every hour.

"The cloud is coming. Let us face it together."

She closed the channel.

                               * * *

Marchetti's response from Geneva arrived forty hours later. It was
terse, furious, and contained phrases like "unauthorized modification
of Consortium assets," "potential court-martial proceedings," and
"grave consequences."

Okoye read it once and filed it.

Two days later, the sabotage stopped.

A week after that, four new gravity tugs arrived from the outer
system — not from the Consortium supply chain, but from independent
operators in the Kuiper Belt who had heard the broadcast and
volunteered their equipment. A note accompanied the shipment: "For
the Wall. From the people it protects."

Okoye put the note on her desk, next to the growth projections.
Then she went back to work.

                               X.

The Wall was completed on March 12, 2043, seven months ahead of the
revised schedule. It was nine thousand one hundred kilometers in
diameter — slightly larger than planned, to accommodate additional
volunteer bodies provided by outer-system mining operations. It
contained four thousand eight hundred and twelve individual cometary
and asteroidal bodies, fused into a single structure that was, by
any measure, the largest object ever constructed by human beings.

The Alderson Cloud arrived on schedule, eighteen months later. The
leading edge struck the Wall at six hundred kilometers per second
and was deflected.

Not stopped. Deflected. The Wall was never meant to stop the cloud
— that would have required a structure of impossible size. It was
meant to redirect the densest part of the debris stream away from
the inner system, scattering it into the interstellar void. The
physics were simple: an object in the path of a stream diverts the
stream. The engineering was not simple at all. But it worked.

The bombardment lasted nine years. During that time, the Wall
absorbed impacts that would have devastated every inhabited world
in the solar system. It cracked, it fractured, it lost sections
that had to be repaired by crews working in conditions that made
the original construction look like a vacation. Seventeen workers
died during the bombardment years. Their names were engraved on the
Wall itself, in letters visible from orbit.

When the cloud passed, the Wall remained — battered, scarred,
magnificent. It stood in the outer darkness like a monument to
what human beings could do when they agreed that something needed
to be built, and when they trusted the builders to build only what
was needed.

Amara Okoye returned to Earth in 2053, at the age of sixty-seven.
She had spent twelve years at Farwatch Station. The Consortium
had long since dropped its charges against her — the political
winds had shifted, as political winds do, and the woman who had
defied Geneva was now the woman who had saved the solar system.
She declined three medals and two honorary doctorates.

She took a teaching position at MIT, in the civil engineering
department. On her first day, a student asked her what the most
important principle of engineering was.

She thought about it for a moment.

"Build what you promised," she said. "Nothing more. Nothing less."

Through her office window, the sky was clear and blue, and somewhere
beyond it, three hundred AU from the sun, the Great Wall of Sol
stood in the darkness, doing exactly what it had been built to do.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         BREAKING THE SEAL

                         by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

The station was big enough to have its own weather.

Jack Reese stood on the hull of the demolition ship _Crowbar_ and
stared at the thing they'd been sent to take apart, and for the
first time in twenty-three years of wrecking, he felt the urge to
turn around and go home.

Fortuna Station hung in the void like a small, ugly moon — a mass
of interconnected modules, domes, gantries, and structural plating
that had been accreting for the better part of a century. It had
started life as a research platform in orbit around Titan, grown
into a shipyard, mutated into a trading hub, and finally been
decommissioned twelve years ago when the trade routes shifted and
the corporate consortium that owned it decided the maintenance costs
weren't worth the revenue. They'd pulled out the crew, locked the
doors, and left it to drift.

Twelve years of drift. Twelve years of vacuum and radiation and the
slow, cold decay that ate everything in space if you gave it enough
time.

Now someone had decided to scrap it, and Jack Reese's Wrecking Crew
had drawn the contract.

"That," said Enid Chavez from beside him, "is the biggest damn thing
I've ever seen."

"Bigger than Kessler Platform?"

"Kessler was six modules. This is — what, a hundred?"

"One hundred and forty-seven, according to the manifest." Reese
pulled up the station schematics on his helmet display and whistled
through his teeth. "Plus external structures. Total mass is
approximately eighteen million metric tons."

"How long did they give us?"

"Six months."

Chavez laughed. It was not a happy laugh. "Six months. For eighteen
million tons. Tell me you negotiated hazard pay."

"Double rate."

"Not enough."

"I know."

Reese took one more look at Fortuna Station, imprinting it on his
memory the way he always did before a job. In six months — if
everything went right, which it never did — this thing would be a
cloud of sorted materials: metals to the smelters, composites to
the recyclers, everything else to the void. That was the job. That
was what the Wrecking Crew did. They took things apart.

"All right," he said. "Let's go introduce ourselves."

                               * * *

The crew assembled in the _Crowbar's_ mess hall for the pre-entry
briefing. There were twelve of them — the standard complement for a
Class IV demolition contract, which was the biggest classification
there was, short of "call the military."

Reese stood at the head of the table, the station schematics
projected on the wall behind him. He was a big man — six-one, broad
across the chest, with hands like shovels and a face that looked
like it had been assembled from leftover parts: heavy jaw, flat nose,
deep-set eyes the color of ball bearings. He'd been wrecking since he
was nineteen, starting as a cutter on a salvage barge in Earth orbit
and working his way up to foreman by the time he was thirty. He was
forty-two now and had taken apart everything from orbital labs to
derelict warships to a luxury liner that had suffered a catastrophic
hull breach and needed to be cut up before it became a navigation
hazard.

This was the biggest job he'd ever seen.

"Listen up," he said. The chatter died. "Fortuna Station. Built
between 1987 and 2034. Decommissioned 2041. Twelve years dark. Our
contract is to reduce the structure to component materials for
recycling and salvage. Standard demolition protocols apply, with the
following exceptions."

He tapped the schematic. "Exception one. The station's reactor
section — here, in the central hub — contains three fusion reactors
that were shut down but not decommissioned. That means residual
radiation in the surrounding compartments. Nobody goes near the
reactor section without full rad gear and a dosimeter check every
thirty minutes."

"What kind of levels are we talking about?" asked Kofi Mensah, the
crew's radiation specialist, a wiry Ghanaian who had spent a decade
cleaning up hot zones on Luna.

"The pre-survey says moderate. Nothing lethal at short exposure, but
accumulated dose is a concern. We'll pull the reactors first, before
we start structural demolition."

"Exception two," Reese continued. "The station's decommissioning
report flags several sections as 'sealed — do not access.' These are
compartments that were locked and pressurized when the crew left. The
report doesn't say why."

"That's helpful," said Chavez.

"Isn't it? Standard protocol for sealed compartments: we scan before
we open. If the scan is clean, we proceed. If it's not, we flag it
and move on."

"And exception three?" asked Lev Petrov, the crew's demolitions
expert, a mountainous Russian who had the disconcerting habit of
humming show tunes while setting explosive charges.

"Exception three is the station's size. This thing has its own
internal gravity — centrifugal sections, spin habitats. Some of those
may still be rotating. If they are, we've got inertial hazards in
addition to the usual structural concerns. Nobody moves through a
spinning section alone. Buddy system at all times."

He looked around the table. Twelve faces looked back — experienced,
professional, and just slightly apprehensive. Good. Apprehension
was healthy in this line of work. It was the guys who weren't
apprehensive who got killed.

"We start with entry and assessment. Four teams of three. Map the
station, verify the schematics against actual conditions, flag
anything that doesn't match the paperwork. Full entry report by end
of day two. Questions?"

"Yeah," said Chavez. "What's that?" She pointed to a section of the
schematic that was shaded gray — no internal detail, just a blank
rectangle in the station's lower hemisphere. "The schematics don't
show anything inside that module."

Reese frowned. She was right. Module 142, according to the index,
was designated "Storage — Restricted Access." No interior layout. No
systems data. No decommissioning notes.

"It's probably classified," said Mensah. "Corporate stations always
have a few locked rooms where the suits kept their secrets."

"Probably," Reese agreed. "We'll scan it with everything else. If
it's just storage, we pop it open and scrap it like the rest."

"And if it's not just storage?"

"Then it becomes somebody else's problem. We're wreckers, not
detectives."

                               * * *

The entry teams went in the next morning.

Reese took Team One — himself, Chavez, and a young cutter named
Darnell Washington who had been with the crew for two years and was
shaping up to be one of the best structural demolition specialists
Reese had ever trained. They entered through the main docking port
on the station's north face, cycling through an airlock that still
worked — atmospheric seals holding, lights activating on entry,
internal air registering breathable if stale.

"Station's in better shape than I expected," Reese said, moving
through the docking corridor. The walls were clean, the floor
panels intact, the overhead lighting functional. It looked like the
crew had walked out yesterday, not twelve years ago.

"That's because nobody's been here to trash it," Chavez said.
"Vacuum is a great preservationist."

They moved deeper, following the schematic's corridor layout toward
the central hub. The station was enormous — it took them forty
minutes just to traverse the distance from the docking port to the
first major junction, passing through habitat modules, storage bays,
and a cafeteria that still had trays stacked in the dispensing racks.
Reese noted everything, marking his digital map with structural
assessments. Wall integrity: good. Floor panels: secure. Ceiling
mounts: three percent corrosion.

At the central junction, the corridors branched in six directions.
Reese sent Chavez and Washington down the port-side branch toward
the engineering section and took the starboard branch himself, heading
for the sealed compartments that the decommissioning report had
flagged.

He found the first one two hundred meters down the corridor. A
heavy blast door — not the standard pressure doors that separated
the rest of the station's compartments, but a reinforced barrier of
the kind used in military installations. It was sealed with
electronic locks and a mechanical dead bolt. A sign on the door
read: RESTRICTED — AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY — DO NOT BREACH.

"Charming," Reese muttered. He pulled out his scanner and ran it
over the door and the compartment beyond. The readings were
unremarkable — standard atmosphere inside, ambient temperature, no
radiation, no biological hazards. Just an empty room behind a very
heavy door.

He noted it on his map and moved on. There would be time to open
it later.

He found the second sealed compartment three corridors down, and
the third around a bend. Same doors. Same locks. Same signs. Same
clean scans.

The fourth sealed compartment was different.

The door was the same — heavy, reinforced, locked. The sign was
the same. But the scan was not clean. Reese frowned at his
scanner display, ran the scan again, and got the same result.

The compartment behind the door was cold. Not station-temperature
cold, but deep cold — minus one hundred and seventy degrees Celsius.
Colder than the ambient exterior. Something inside was actively
refrigerated, drawing power from somewhere even though the station
had been dark for twelve years.

And the scan showed a mass reading that didn't match an empty room.
Something was in there. Something large, dense, and very, very cold.

Reese stared at the scanner. Then he keyed his comm.

"Chavez. Reese. I need you at my position. Bring Washington. And
bring the heavy cutter."

"What've you got, boss?"

"I've got a locked room with something in it that somebody went to
a lot of trouble to keep frozen. And I've got a bad feeling."

"Copy. On our way."

                               * * *

It took them thirty minutes to cut through the blast door. The heavy
cutter — a plasma-arc tool designed to slice through ship hulls —
went through the reinforced steel in a shower of sparks and molten
metal that spattered across the corridor floor and cooled into bright
orange beads. Reese stood back and let Washington work; the kid had
the steadiest hands on the crew, and a blast door was no place for
impatience.

The door fell inward with a boom that echoed through the empty
corridors. A wave of cold air rushed out — not air, exactly, but
supercooled gas that condensed instantly into a fog of ice crystals,
swirling around their ankles and biting through their suits.

Reese stepped through.

The compartment was large — maybe twenty meters square and ten high.
The walls were lined with refrigeration units, industrial-grade,
humming with a low, steady vibration that explained where the power
was coming from: they had their own dedicated fuel cells, separate
from the station's main reactor grid. Someone had installed an
independent power supply to keep this room cold, and it had been
running for twelve years.

In the center of the room, mounted on a raised platform, was a
containment vessel.

It was cylindrical, about four meters tall and two in diameter,
made of a dark, matte material that Reese didn't recognize. It was
covered in frost, the surface white and crystalline, and it was
anchored to the platform by a framework of heavy clamps that
looked like they were designed to withstand significant force.
Not to keep the vessel still — to keep it from getting out.

"What the hell is that?" Washington said.

"Nothing good," Reese said. He moved closer, scanning the vessel
with his handheld. The readings were strange — the mass was right
for a solid object of that size, but the density was uneven,
fluctuating in a way that suggested the contents were not solid,
not liquid, not gas, but something that was shifting between states.

"Boss," Chavez said. She was at one of the refrigeration units,
reading the diagnostic panel. "These units are set to maintain
interior temperature at minus one-seventy. There are failsafe
protocols — if the temperature rises above minus one-fifty, the
system triggers an alarm. If it rises above minus one hundred, the
system triggers a—" She stopped.

"Triggers a what?"

"A purge. Thermite charges. Built into the platform under the
vessel. If the contents warm up past minus one hundred, the whole
thing incinerates."

The three of them stood in the cold room, looking at the frost-
covered vessel with its clamps and its thermite charges and its
independent power supply, and nobody said anything for a long
moment.

"We didn't just break a seal," Reese said, finally. "We opened a
cage."

"A cage for what?" Washington asked.

Reese looked at the vessel. The frost on its surface was already
beginning to thin — the open door had let warm air in, and the
refrigeration units were struggling to compensate. The temperature
display on the nearest unit was climbing. Minus one-sixty-eight.
Minus one-sixty-five.

"Chavez, get on the comm. Contact the Consortium emergency line.
Tell them we've found something on Fortuna Station that somebody
went to a lot of trouble to keep contained, and we need someone
who knows what it is. Now."

"And us?"

"We seal this room back up. Whatever's in that vessel, it's been
frozen for twelve years for a reason, and I'm not going to be the
idiot who defrosts it."

                               * * *

They couldn't reseal the blast door — the plasma cutter had destroyed
the locking mechanism. Reese improvised: they welded a sheet of hull
plating across the opening, using the cutter in low-power mode,
and packed the seams with spray insulation from the _Crowbar's_
stores. It wasn't elegant, but it would hold the cold in.

Then they waited.

The Consortium response came six hours later — fast, by bureaucratic
standards, which told Reese more than the actual content of the
message. Someone in the Consortium's records division knew what was
in Module 142. Someone had been expecting this call.

The message was brief: Do not approach the containment vessel. Do
not attempt to open or examine it. Do not allow the room temperature
to rise above minus one hundred and fifty degrees. A specialized
team is being dispatched. ETA: ninety-six hours.

"Ninety-six hours," Chavez said. "Four days."

"Four days to sit on our hands while the meter's running," Reese
said. He was not happy. Breaking the Seal was a small operation —
twelve people, one ship, and a reputation that lived or died on
completing contracts on time and on budget. Four days of dead time
meant four days of crew salaries with no progress, and the contract
had no provision for mysterious frozen objects in sealed rooms.

"What do you think it is?" Washington asked. He was young enough to
be more curious than cautious, which was a quality that Reese
planned to break him of before it got him killed.

"I think it's not our problem," Reese said. "I think we've got one
hundred and forty-six other modules to tear apart, and that's
exactly what we're going to do while we wait for the experts."

"But—"

"Darnell. Listen to me. In this line of work, you will occasionally
find things that somebody hid. Sometimes it's contraband. Sometimes
it's a body. Once, on the Kessler job, it was fourteen hundred
kilograms of refined plutonium in a false bulkhead. Every single
time, the right move is the same: call it in, step back, and let
somebody else deal with it. We are wreckers. We are not heroes, we
are not scientists, and we are not qualified to handle whatever is
in that vessel. Clear?"

"Clear, boss."

"Good. Now go help Petrov with the survey on the upper decks. I
want a structural map of the habitat ring by tonight."

Washington went. Chavez lingered.

"You're worried," she said.

"I'm always worried. It's why I'm still alive."

"More worried than usual."

Reese looked at the welded plate that covered the opening to Module
142. The spray insulation was already developing a skin of frost, the
cold inside fighting to get out.

"The thermite charges," he said. "They're not a failsafe. They're a
last resort. Somebody built a self-destruct into that containment
system because they believed that whatever's in that vessel is
worse than losing the vessel entirely. You don't build a self-
destruct for a science experiment. You build it for something
dangerous."

"So we stay away from it."

"We stay away from it. And we hope the Consortium's experts get here
before the refrigeration units run out of fuel."

"How long do the fuel cells have?"

Reese checked his scanner notes. "At current draw, approximately
eleven days."

"That's cutting it close."

"Yeah," Reese said. "It is."

                               * * *

The experts did not arrive in four days.

On day two, the Consortium sent an updated message: the specialized
team had been delayed due to a scheduling conflict. New ETA: seven
days.

On day four, another update: eight days. A "logistics issue."

On day five, Reese sent a message of his own: "The independent fuel
cells powering the refrigeration units in Module 142 have an
estimated remaining operational life of six days. If your team does
not arrive before the fuel cells are exhausted, the containment
vessel's temperature will rise to ambient, and either the thermite
failsafe will engage or the contents will thaw. Please advise."

The response came in three hours — the fastest turnaround yet.
"Maintain containment. Supplement power if possible. Team is being
expedited."

"Supplement power," Reese said to Chavez. "With what? We're a
demolition ship, not a power station."

"We could run a line from the _Crowbar's_ reactor," Chavez said.
"Patch it into the refrigeration units."

"That would mean tapping our main power supply to keep their
mystery box frozen."

"You got a better idea?"

He didn't. They ran the line.

                               * * *

The specialized team arrived on day nine — two days past the original
deadline, three days past the revised one, and roughly twelve hours
before the _Crowbar's_ power tap would have started affecting the
ship's own operational systems.

They came in a ship with no markings, crewed by people who wore
uniforms with no insignia and carried equipment in sealed cases
that they refused to open in the presence of the Wrecking Crew.
The team leader introduced herself only as "Dr. Kessler" — Reese
suspected it was not her real name — and asked to be taken to
Module 142 immediately.

Reese took her. They cut away the improvised seal, and Dr. Kessler
and her team entered the cold room while Reese and Chavez waited
in the corridor. Through the open doorway, they could see the team
working around the containment vessel — scanning it, measuring it,
conferring in low voices that didn't carry.

After an hour, Dr. Kessler came out.

"Thank you, Mr. Reese. Your power supplementation was well-timed.
The containment is stable. My team will take over from here."

"Happy to hear it. You want to tell me what's in there?"

"No."

"Didn't think so. It's going to be in my report, though. The whole
thing — the sealed room, the containment vessel, the thermite
charges, all of it."

"I would strongly advise against that."

"And I would strongly advise you to be straight with me, Doctor,
because I've got a crew of twelve people who spent two weeks babysitting
your frozen mystery, and they deserve to know whether they were in
danger."

Kessler studied him. She was a small, sharp-featured woman with gray
eyes and the manner of someone who was accustomed to being obeyed.

"They were not in danger," she said, carefully, "as long as the
containment held."

"And if it hadn't?"

"Then danger would be an understatement."

She went back into the cold room and closed the improvised door
behind her.

Breaking the Seal finished the Fortuna Station demolition in five
months and eighteen days — twelve days ahead of schedule, despite
the two-week delay. Module 142 was not included in the demolition.
It was detached from the station intact by Dr. Kessler's team,
loaded onto their unmarked ship, and taken somewhere that Reese was
not told about and did not ask.

He filed his report with the Consortium, including a full account
of Module 142. The report was accepted without comment. A week
later, he received a rider to his contract adding a "security
compliance bonus" of twice the original contract value.

"Hush money," Chavez said.

"Hazard pay," Reese corrected. "For a hazard we didn't know about."

"Same thing."

"Yeah," he admitted. "Same thing."

He stood at the viewport of the _Crowbar_ and watched the last
fragments of Fortuna Station drift apart — eighteen million tons
of steel, composite, and mystery, reduced to sorted scrap and
catalogued salvage. A century of human construction, taken apart
in six months by twelve people with plasma cutters and shaped
charges.

Somewhere out there, in a ship with no name, Module 142 was
traveling to a destination he would never know, carrying a secret
he would never learn. That was fine. He was a wrecker. His job was
to take things apart, not to understand them.

But late at night, in the quiet hours between jobs, when the
_Crowbar_ was cruising dark and the crew was asleep, Jack Reese
sometimes thought about that frost-covered vessel in its cold
room, with its clamps and its thermite charges and its twelve years
of silent, patient waiting.

And he wondered what would have happened if they had been one day
later.

                         FLICKERING BOARDS

                        by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                               I.

Clara drove the last nail at sunset, and by morning it was gone.

Not the nail. The board. The entire eastern wall of what she had,
with cautious optimism, begun calling the kitchen. Twelve boards,
each one cut from timber she had milled herself from the trees at
the edge of the settlement — trees that were themselves only
occasionally present — fitted together with mortise-and-tenon joints
because nails, she had learned, vanished faster than wood. The joints
had held. The boards had not.

She stood in the pale orange light of the Vashta morning and looked
at the gap where the wall had been. The remaining three walls stood
solid, framing a rectangle of packed earth floor with one open side,
like a stage set missing a wing. Her tools were where she had left
them — saw, plane, hammer, level — laid out on the workbench she had
built from a single slab of rock that had, so far, proven stable.
The rock was from deep underground. The deep things lasted longer.
Nobody knew why.

She picked up her saw and went to cut more boards.

                               * * *

The planet was called Vashta, and the people who had come to settle
it called themselves, with the dark humor of the desperate, the
Builders. There were four hundred and twelve of them, down from the
five hundred and thirty who had landed eighteen months ago. The
missing hundred and eighteen had not died — or at least, most of
them had not. They had left. Gone back up to the colony ship in
orbit, the _Perseverance_, which still had power and air and
artificial gravity and, most importantly, walls that stayed where
you put them.

Vashta was a world where reality was unreliable. That was the
technical assessment. The survey team's report, filed before
colonization was approved, had used phrases like "localized
ontological instability" and "intermittent material coherence loss"
and "spontaneous object demanifestion." What these phrases meant,
in practical terms, was that things on Vashta disappeared.

Not everything. Not all the time. The ground stayed. The sky stayed.
The air, the water, the big geological features — mountains, rivers,
the basalt formations along the southern coast — these were stable.
They had been here for millions of years and showed no signs of
going anywhere. But smaller things — objects below a certain mass
threshold, objects above a certain complexity, objects that had been
recently changed or moved — these flickered. They were here, and
then they were not, and then sometimes they were here again, and
sometimes they were not.

The pattern, such as it was, had been studied by the colony's
scientists with the frantic attention of people whose equipment
kept disappearing. Dr. Yuen, the settlement's physicist, had
developed a theory involving quantum coherence fields and probability
gradients that Clara did not pretend to understand. What she
understood was the practical reality: anything you built on Vashta
might vanish overnight. A wall. A roof. A fence. A chair. A cup
left on a table. A blanket on a bed.

The bed itself.

Some things lasted longer than others. Heavy things. Simple things.
Things made from local materials, especially stone and the dense,
dark wood of the basin trees that grew in the valleys. Things that
had been in place for a long time seemed to accumulate a kind of
stability — Dr. Yuen called it "coherence momentum" — as though
the universe gradually accepted their existence and stopped trying
to take them back.

But there was no guarantee. Nothing was certain. You built, and you
waited, and you woke up in the morning and looked to see what was
still there.

Clara had been building for eighteen months, and she was not done
yet.

                               II.

She had chosen her homestead site with care. It was on a low rise
at the edge of the settlement, overlooking the river valley to the
south. The ground was stable — dense basalt bedrock, according to
the geological survey, part of a formation that was billions of
years old and showed perfect coherence. The trees in the nearby
grove were old-growth basin timber, deep-rooted, their trunks as
wide as a person was tall. They flickered less than the younger
trees. They had been here long enough that the world had accepted
them.

Clara planned to be accepted too.

Her house was a simple structure — or would be, when it was
finished. Four rooms: kitchen, bedroom, workroom, and a front room
with a window facing the valley. Stone foundation, timber frame,
timber walls, timber roof. No machinery, no electronics, no
composite materials brought down from the ship. Everything local.
Everything simple. Everything heavy and dense and deeply rooted in
the planet's own substance.

She had learned the hard way what worked and what didn't. In the
first month, she had tried to build with the prefabricated panels
from the colony's supply store — lightweight polymer sheets designed
for rapid shelter construction. They vanished within hours, sometimes
while she was still attaching them. She tried steel framing next.
It lasted three days.

Then she tried wood.

The first timber wall lasted a week before it disappeared. But it
came back — four days later, in the middle of the night, with a
soft thump that woke her from sleep. She went outside and found it
standing exactly where she had built it, every board in place, as
though it had never left.

That was when she began to understand. The planet was not hostile.
It was not trying to stop her. It was — testing was too purposeful a
word, but it was the closest she could find. The planet was testing
the coherence of what she built, the way a river tested the banks
that contained it. If the thing she built was solid enough, simple
enough, rooted enough, the planet would eventually accept it. But
it had to prove itself first.

She began building with that understanding. She cut her timber from
the oldest trees, with their permission — she had started talking to
the trees, she knew this was not entirely rational, she did not care
— and she let the cut wood season in the open air for two weeks
before she used it, allowing it to adjust to its new form. She sank
her foundation stones deep into the basalt, anchoring them with
their own weight. She built slowly, one board at a time, checking
each morning to see what had survived the night.

And gradually, stubbornly, the house grew.

                               * * *

Clara was not the only Builder who had stayed. In the settlement
below her rise, forty-seven others were engaged in the same patient,
maddening work — constructing homes, workshops, fences, storage
buildings, a meeting hall. The settlement looked, from a distance,
like a town that was being built and demolished simultaneously:
walls half up, roofs missing, doorframes standing alone in empty
lots where the walls around them had vanished.

Marcus Hale was building a blacksmith's forge. He was a metallurgist
by training, a squat, quiet man from the Welsh mining valleys, and
he had taken to Vashta with the grim determination of someone who
understood that shaping resistant materials was the whole point of
his existence. His forge was built from stone — quarried basalt,
dressed by hand, fitted without mortar — and it was the most stable
structure in the settlement. The anvil had been there for six
months without flickering once.

"The trick," he told Clara, over a cup of coffee at the meeting
hall — the meeting hall being a roofless rectangle of stone walls
that had been rebuilt three times — "is to make the planet forget
that you changed anything. Take the stone. Shape it. Put it back.
If you do it right, the planet thinks it's still just stone. It
doesn't notice."

"You're anthropomorphizing a planet," Clara said.

"I'm anthropomorphizing reality. It's a bad habit. But it works."

Dr. Yuen, when Clara asked her about this, was less colorful but
not entirely dismissive. "There is a pattern in the coherence data
that is consistent with Mr. Hale's intuition," she said. She was
a precise, careful woman who wore the same gray jumpsuit every day
— she had given up on varied clothing after her wardrobe vanished
for the third time — and she spoke with the measured caution of
someone who knew her data was incomplete. "Objects that are
minimally transformed from their source state show higher coherence
persistence. A stone block that still resembles a stone persists
longer than a polymer panel that resembles nothing in the local
environment. The planet — the coherence field — appears to have a
bias toward continuity."

"A bias toward things that belong," Clara said.

"That is one way to interpret the data. I would note that we do
not have sufficient data to confirm this interpretation."

"But it's the interpretation that works."

"It is the interpretation that is consistent with the observed
construction outcomes, yes."

Clara went home and built another wall. This time, she left the
bark on the boards.

It was still there in the morning.

                               III.

The winter came early.

On Vashta, winter meant cold — not the moderate chill of the
settlement's first months, but a deep, penetrating freeze that
dropped temperatures well below zero and sent frost creeping across
every surface. The river froze. The trees shed their leaves — the
leaves, being small and recently detached, vanished almost
immediately, creating the unsettling spectacle of a forest that
was simultaneously autumnal and bare.

Clara's house was not finished. She had three walls on the kitchen,
two on the bedroom, and a partial roof that covered about half the
structure. The front room and workroom existed only as foundation
stones and a few upright posts.

It was not enough.

She worked through the short winter days with a concentration that
bordered on fury, cutting timber in the gray morning light, fitting
boards in the pale afternoon, collapsing into her bedroll at
nightfall and rising before dawn to see what had survived. The cold
helped, in a strange way. Cold things were more stable than warm
things — Dr. Yuen theorized that reduced molecular motion improved
coherence — and Clara's winter-built walls lasted longer than her
summer ones. The kitchen gained its fourth wall on the third day
of winter and kept it. The bedroom walls went up in a week.

The roof was harder.

A roof was complex. It was many pieces joined at angles, supported
by joists that had to bear weight without direct contact with the
ground. It was, in the language of the planet's physics, highly
transformed — wood that had been cut, shaped, lifted, and arranged
into a configuration that bore no resemblance to anything that had
ever existed on Vashta before. The coherence field resisted roofs
the way water resisted being held in an open hand.

Clara lost three roofs in two weeks. Each time, she woke to find
the sky above her, the stars visible through the gap where the
timbers had been, and her blankets — when she still had blankets —
dusted with frost.

The fourth time, she tried something different.

She didn't build a roof. She grew one.

She transplanted a basin tree sapling — a young tree, barely taller
than herself, its trunk as thick as her wrist — into the gap
between her bedroom walls. She staked it in place, watered it, and
waited. The sapling, being a living thing rooted in the planet's
own soil, had excellent coherence. It stayed. It grew. Slowly, over
the course of two weeks, its branches spread outward, extending
over the bedroom walls, creating a canopy of dense, dark leaves
that shed water and blocked wind.

It was not a conventional roof. It leaked in heavy rain. It rustled
in the wind. Small insects lived in it, and occasionally one would
drop onto her face while she was sleeping.

But it stayed. It was part of the planet, growing in the planet's
soil, doing what trees did. The coherence field accepted it without
question.

Marcus came to see it and stood for a long time, staring up at the
tree growing through the middle of Clara's bedroom.

"You're insane," he said.

"I'm warm," she said.

"Those are not mutually exclusive."

"No. But one of them matters more right now."

                               IV.

Spring came. The ice on the river broke with a sound like a
gunshot, and the trees put out new leaves, and the air warmed, and
some of the settlers who had gone back to the _Perseverance_ came
down again to try once more.

Clara's house survived the winter with all four kitchen walls, three
bedroom walls (the fourth had vanished and returned twice), the
living tree roof over the bedroom, and the beginnings of a stone
chimney that Marcus had helped her build. It was, by the standards
of the settlement, a mansion. It was, by the standards of any
other world, a hovel — a ramshackle collection of bark-covered
boards and mismatched stones, with a tree growing through the
middle of it and gaps in the walls that she had stuffed with dried
river grass.

She did not care. It was hers. She had built it, board by board,
stone by stone, day after day, in the face of a universe that kept
trying to take it apart. And it was still standing.

That was enough.

                               * * *

New settlers arrived in the spring — not from the _Perseverance_,
but from Earth. A second colony ship, the _Endurance_, had been
dispatched with three hundred additional settlers and a cargo hold
full of supplies. They landed on a bright morning, their shuttle
kicking up dust as it settled on the flat ground west of the
settlement, and they emerged blinking into the Vashta sunlight with
the expressions of people who had read the reports but had not
quite believed them.

Clara was among the original settlers who met them. She stood in
the welcoming line, her hands calloused, her clothes patched, her
hair cut short with a knife because scissors vanished too quickly
to be worth keeping, and she watched the new arrivals look around
at the settlement — the half-built houses, the missing walls, the
roofless meeting hall — with a mixture of curiosity and poorly
concealed dismay.

A young woman named Priya, an architect by training, broke away
from the group and walked up to Clara's house. She studied it for
a long time — the bark-covered walls, the stone foundation, the
tree growing through the roof.

"You built this?" she asked.

"Yes."

"It's — unconventional."

"It's standing."

Priya touched the nearest wall, running her fingers over the rough
bark surface. "The walls are unskinned timber. No treatment, no
sealant."

"Sealant vanishes. The bark stays."

"And the tree?"

"The tree is my roof."

Priya was quiet for a moment. She was a tall woman, precise and
composed, with the posture of someone who had spent years learning
how buildings were supposed to be built. Clara could see her
processing — could see the conflict between her training and the
evidence of her eyes.

"I've been studying the survey reports on the transit," Priya said,
slowly. "The coherence field dynamics. I have some ideas about how
to build structures that might resist demanifestion more effectively.
New techniques. Better materials."

"Such as?"

"Composite local materials — stone and timber, but processed in
specific ways to maximize coherence momentum. And architectural
forms that mimic natural structures — arches, curves, shapes that
the planet's systems might recognize as consistent with the local
environment."

Clara looked at her. "You want to build things that look like they
grew here."

"Essentially, yes."

"That's what I've been doing."

Priya looked at the house again. At the bark walls. At the tree.
At the moss that had started growing on the north-facing stones.

"Yes," she said. "I can see that." She paused. "Would you be
willing to work with me? I have the theory. You have the practice."

Clara considered this. She looked at her house — her stubborn,
imperfect, still-standing house — and she looked at the settlement
around it, its buildings rising and falling like the tides, and she
looked at the new settlers standing by their shuttle, fresh and
bewildered and not yet understanding what it meant to build on a
world that might unmake your work overnight.

"Yes," she said. "But I'll warn you now — the first thing you build
will disappear. And the second. And probably the third. It's the
fourth one that matters. The fourth one is when you find out whether
you're going to stay."

"What happened to your fourth one?"

Clara pointed at the kitchen wall — the solid, bark-covered, twelve-
board wall that had been standing for nine months now without so
much as a flicker.

"Still here," she said.

                               V.

They built together through the spring and into the summer. Priya's
ideas were good — better than good. She designed structures using
curved forms that echoed the shapes of the basin trees: arching
walls, domed roofs, rooms that flowed into each other like the
chambers of a seashell. She used local stone and timber, processed
minimally, and she developed a technique for joining boards with
tongue-and-groove cuts so precise that the joints were nearly
invisible — the boards fitting together as though they had grown
that way.

The coherence results were remarkable. Priya's structures lasted
longer on their first placement than anything the settlement had
built before. The curved walls persisted at a rate of eighty-seven
percent — compared to the flat-wall average of sixty-three percent
— and the domed roofs, which distributed their weight evenly and
presented a shape that the planet's coherence field seemed to
recognize as natural, persisted at ninety-one percent.

The settlement began to change. The half-built, half-vanished
quality of the early months gave way to something more permanent.
Curved walls rose along the main street. Domed roofs covered the
workshops and storage buildings. The meeting hall finally got a
roof — a great dome of interlocking stone, fitted without mortar,
that Marcus built over the course of three weeks and that survived
its first night, and its second, and every night after that.

Clara watched it happen with a feeling she had almost forgotten:
hope.

Not the desperate, teeth-gritting hope of the first winter, when
hope had been a survival mechanism, a way of getting through one
more day. This was a different kind of hope. Quieter. Deeper. The
hope of a woman who could see, for the first time, the shape of
what she was building — not just a house, not just a settlement,
but a way of living in a world that did not owe her existence.

On the longest day of summer, the settlement held a celebration in
the domed meeting hall. Two hundred and seven people — the Builders
who had stayed, and those of the new settlers who had chosen to
try — gathered under the stone dome and ate food grown from the
planet's soil and drank water from the planet's river and talked
and laughed and argued about what to build next.

Clara sat on a stone bench at the edge of the gathering, her back
against the curved wall, and listened. The wall was solid against
her shoulders. The dome arched above her, each stone fitted to its
neighbor, the whole structure held together by nothing but geometry
and weight and the planet's grudging acceptance of their right to
be here.

Marcus sat down beside her. "Good wall," he said, tapping the
stone behind them.

"Good dome."

"Took me three tries."

"Only three?"

He smiled. It was a rare expression on his face — the face of a
man who had spent his life fighting resistant materials. "I'm
getting better."

"We all are."

She looked around the hall. At the people. At the walls. At the
dome that should not have been possible on a world that unmade
what it did not recognize, and that was standing anyway, because
someone had been stubborn enough to build it.

"I've been thinking," she said.

"That's dangerous."

"I've been thinking about what we're doing here. All of us. Every
day, we get up and we build, knowing it might be gone tomorrow.
Knowing the planet might take it away. And we build anyway."

"We build anyway," Marcus agreed.

"Why?"

Marcus was quiet for a long moment. Around them, the celebration
continued — voices, laughter, the clink of cups made from polished
river stone.

"Because that's what people do," he said, finally. "We build. Not
because it lasts. Because we need to. Because the act of building
is the thing that makes us human. A wall that falls down and gets
built again is more human than a wall that stands forever. The
standing is easy. The rebuilding is the point."

Clara looked at the dome above them. Through the gaps between the
stones — there were always gaps; the planet insisted on imperfection
— she could see the stars, faint points of light in the deep blue
evening sky.

"We're going to be all right," she said.

"Maybe," Marcus said. "Maybe not. But we'll build either way."

She leaned her head against the wall. It was cool and solid and
present. Tomorrow it might be gone. She would build it again.

That was the point. That had always been the point.

She closed her eyes, and the wall held her, and for now — for this
night, in this moment — everything she had built was still here.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                      ARCHITECT'S CONFESSION

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The call came at three in the morning, which is when all the worst
calls come.

Martin Geary, chief structural engineer of Janus Station, fumbled
for the comm panel in the dark of his sleeping compartment and
managed to knock a water glass off the bedside shelf in the process.
The glass drifted away in the station's gentle spin gravity,
tumbling end over end, spilling a slow-motion spiral of water
droplets that hung in the air like tiny planets.

"Geary," he said, blinking at the panel.

"Martin. It's Petra." Petra Vasquez, station director. Her voice
was the voice she used when something was seriously wrong — calm,
precise, and completely drained of warmth. "I need you in my office.
Now."

"What's happened?"

"Simon Ares is dying."

Geary sat up. The water droplets drifted across his face, and he
brushed them away without thinking. Simon Ares. The name hit him
the way certain names always do — not as a word but as a weight,
carrying with it the full freight of history and significance and
personal association.

Simon Ares had designed Janus Station. He was, by near-universal
consensus, the greatest space architect of the past century —
the man who had reimagined what a space station could be, who had
thrown out the utilitarian cylinders and modular boxes that had
defined orbital construction for decades and replaced them with
structures of such beauty and functional elegance that people wept
when they saw them. Janus Station was his masterpiece: a vast,
spiraling double helix of interconnected habitats, laboratories,
and public spaces, spinning gently in the L2 point between Earth
and the Moon, home to fourteen thousand people and considered one of
the architectural wonders of the solar system.

Ares was ninety-one years old. He had been living aboard the station
for the past three years — a sentimental choice, people said,
the old man wanting to spend his final days inside his greatest
creation. He had been in declining health for months. The fact of
his dying was not a surprise.

But the three-in-the-morning urgency suggested something else.

Geary pulled on his jumpsuit, collected the drifting water glass,
and went to the director's office.

                               * * *

Vasquez was waiting for him with Dr. Lena Okafor, the station's
chief medical officer, and a man Geary didn't recognize — a thin,
tense individual in a civilian suit who introduced himself as
Robert Ames, from the Consortium's Office of Infrastructure Safety.

"Mr. Ares has made a statement," Vasquez said. She was standing
behind her desk, her arms folded, her face showing the particular
expression of a station director who has just received information
she deeply wishes she had not. "He asked that we record it. He
asked that you be present, Martin, specifically."

"Why me?"

"Because you're the chief structural engineer. And because of what
he's confessing."

Geary looked at Ames, the Consortium man. Ames looked back with an
expression that combined bureaucratic anxiety with something close
to dread.

"Confessing?" Geary said.

Vasquez touched a control on her desk, and a recording began to play.

The voice was old — a dry, papery whisper, each word placed with
the deliberate care of a man who knows he has a limited number of
them remaining. But it was unmistakably Simon Ares. Geary had met
him twice, at formal events, and the voice was the same — that
distinctive cadence, simultaneously precise and musical, the voice
of a man who thought in blueprints and spoke in poetry.

"My name is Simon Ares. I am the architect of Janus Station. I am
making this statement freely, in the presence of Dr. Lena Okafor,
and I understand that it will be transmitted to the relevant
authorities. I make it now because I am dying and because the truth
must be told before I am no longer capable of telling it.

"Janus Station contains a structural flaw. I designed it. I placed
it deliberately, in full knowledge of its implications. The flaw
is in the central spindle — the main load-bearing column that runs
through the station's axis and supports the counter-rotation of the
two helices. At a point approximately two-thirds of the way along
the spindle's length, I specified a material composition that is
inconsistent with the structural requirements of the design.

"Specifically, I specified a titanium-aluminum alloy of Grade Seven
purity for the spindle's inner sheath at that point. The correct
specification — the one required by the stress calculations — is
Grade Nine. Grade Seven is adequate for normal operational loads.
It is not adequate for the stress concentrations that would occur
during a maximum-rated spin adjustment or an emergency counter-
rotation event.

"The flaw has been present since the station was constructed. It
has never been tested by a maximum-rated event because no such event
has occurred in the station's twenty-eight years of operation. But
the station's golden anniversary is approaching, and the
celebrations will include a ceremonial spin-up to maximum rated
speed. If this spin-up occurs, the stress on the Grade Seven
section of the spindle will exceed its tolerance. The failure mode
would be catastrophic and rapid. The station would break apart.

"I am telling you this now because I can no longer bear the weight
of it, and because fourteen thousand people deserve to know that
the building they live in has a fracture in its heart.

"I am sorry. That is inadequate, but it is true."

The recording ended. The office was silent.

                               II.

Geary listened to the recording three more times. Then he went to
his engineering office, pulled the station's structural blueprints,
and spent two hours verifying Ares's claim.

It took him less time than he expected. The flaw was exactly where
Ares said it was — a material specification on drawing S-412,
page seventeen, line forty-three. Grade Seven where Grade Nine
should be. Geary stared at the specification and felt a sensation
that was part disbelief, part anger, and part a strange, vertiginous
understanding, as though a floor he had been standing on had
suddenly revealed itself to be a trapdoor.

He'd walked past that section of the spindle a hundred times. He'd
conducted routine inspections of the spindle every six months for
the past twelve years. The Grade Seven alloy looked identical to
Grade Nine — same color, same surface texture, same response to
standard non-destructive testing. The difference was internal:
crystalline structure, fatigue resistance, maximum shear strength.
You wouldn't see it. You wouldn't feel it. You would only know it
when it mattered.

He went back to Vasquez's office. Ames was still there, looking
more anxious than before.

"Confirmed," Geary said. "The specification is Grade Seven. It
should be Grade Nine. The stress analysis confirms that the Grade
Seven section would fail under maximum-rated spin conditions."

"How long would we have?" Vasquez asked.

"If a maximum-rated spin-up were initiated? The models say the
Grade Seven section would reach critical stress within approximately
forty minutes. Failure would follow within seconds. The station
would — the helices would decouple. The forces involved would be..."

He didn't finish the sentence. He didn't need to. Everyone in the
room understood what it meant when a spinning structure the size
of a small city lost its axial support.

"The golden anniversary celebration is in nine weeks," Ames said.
"The spin-up is the centerpiece of the event. It's been publicized
across the system. The Secretary-General is scheduled to attend."

"The spin-up is not happening," Vasquez said.

"That decision is above my pay grade, Director."

"Then get someone whose pay grade it is on the line. Right now."

"Can we fix it?" Geary asked. He was already thinking through the
engineering. "Replace the Grade Seven section with Grade Nine?"

"In nine weeks?"

"The affected section is approximately eighteen meters long. We'd
need to cut out the old sheath, fabricate a new one in Grade Nine,
and install it. The spindle is accessible through the axial
maintenance corridor. The work itself is straightforward. The
problem is that the spindle is load-bearing — it's holding the
station together. We can't just cut a section out. We'd need to
install temporary supports to transfer the load while we do the
swap."

"How long?"

Geary ran the numbers in his head. "Six weeks. Maybe five, if we
work double shifts. We'd need to reduce the station's spin rate
during the operation — lower the centrifugal load on the spindle
to give us margin."

"Can we keep the station operational during the work?"

"At reduced spin, yes. Gravity would drop to about sixty percent
of normal. People would notice, but the station would be safe."

Vasquez looked at Ames. "That's your answer. We reduce spin, fix
the flaw, and postpone the spin-up until the repair is complete."

"The political implications—"

"The political implications of the station breaking apart with
fourteen thousand people inside it and the Secretary-General on
board are considerably worse, Mr. Ames."

Ames opened his mouth, closed it, and reached for his comm panel.

                               III.

Geary went to see Ares.

The old architect was in the station's medical wing, in a private
room that overlooked the Grand Atrium — the vast, cathedral-like
space at the heart of the station that was Ares's most celebrated
design achievement. It was a cylindrical volume two hundred meters
long and eighty meters in diameter, its walls lined with trees and
gardens, its ceiling a transparent dome through which the stars
wheeled slowly as the station turned. It was the most beautiful
space Geary had ever seen, and he had seen it every day for twelve
years, and it still made him catch his breath.

Ares was propped up in a medical bed, his body thin and diminished
beneath the blankets, his face a landscape of sharp bones and
transparent skin. His eyes were open — large, dark, still bright
with the intelligence that had conceived the most remarkable
structures in human history.

"Mr. Geary," he said. His voice was weaker than it had been in
the recording — the effort of his confession had cost him. "Thank
you for coming."

Geary sat down in the chair beside the bed. He had prepared many
things to say — questions, accusations, the angry words of an
engineer who had just learned that the building he maintained had
a deliberate weakness built into its bones. But looking at Ares —
at the frail, luminous wreck of the man who had created the most
beautiful thing in the solar system — the anger drained away, and
what was left was simpler and harder to name.

"Why?" he asked.

Ares closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, they were
focused on something beyond the room — on the Atrium, perhaps, or
on something further, something only he could see.

"Have you ever built something perfect, Mr. Geary?"

"No."

"Neither have I. But Janus — Janus was close. When the final
designs came together, when I stood back and looked at what I had
created on paper, I saw something that was, within the limits of
human engineering, without flaw. Every stress calculation balanced.
Every material specification optimal. Every proportion, every curve,
every joint — perfect. I had been designing buildings for forty
years, and I had never achieved that before. Perfection."

He paused, gathering breath. "And I was terrified."

Geary waited.

"Perfection is inhuman, Mr. Geary. A perfect building is not a
building that people live in. It is a monument. It is a tomb. It
says to the people inside it: you cannot improve this, you cannot
change this, you cannot make it more yours. It stands above you,
complete and untouchable, and you are merely its tenants.

"I did not want to build a tomb. I wanted to build a home. And a
home must have — must contain within itself — the possibility of
vulnerability. A crack. A weakness. Something that says: I am not
eternal, I am not divine, I am a thing made by human hands, and
human hands must tend me, or I will fall.

"The flaw in the spindle is that crack. It is my gift to the
people who live here — my assurance that Janus needs them, that it
is not self-sufficient, that it requires their attention and their
care. A perfect building does not need its occupants. An imperfect
building needs them desperately. And being needed — being essential
to the survival of the place you call home — is, I believe, a
fundamental human requirement."

Geary sat in the chair, listening, and felt the slow, uncomfortable
sensation of understanding something that he did not want to
understand. Because the argument was mad. It was irresponsible. It
was the most dangerous piece of architectural philosophy he had
ever heard. And it was, at some level that he could not quite
dismiss, almost true.

"You put fourteen thousand people at risk," he said. "For a
philosophy."

"Yes."

"You understand that's indefensible."

"I do. That is why I am confessing."

"Why now?"

"Because the spin-up would have found it. Because fourteen thousand
people would have died. Because my philosophy was never meant to
be tested — it was meant to be discovered, understood, and corrected.
The flaw was always intended to be found. I assumed — I hoped — that
a routine inspection would catch it, that someone would look at the
specification and see the discrepancy, and that the correction would
be made, and the people who made it would understand that their
building needed them."

"Nobody found it," Geary said. "In twenty-eight years."

"No. Nobody found it. And that is my second failure — the failure
of my faith in human attention. I overestimated the likelihood of
discovery. I underestimated the trust that people place in the
specifications they inherit. You, Mr. Geary — you have inspected
the spindle many times. Did you ever question the material
specification?"

Geary thought about it. The answer, honest and uncomfortable, was
no. He had inspected the spindle for visible damage, for wear, for
fatigue indicators. He had never gone back to the blueprints and
checked the material grades against the stress calculations. Why
would he? The architect was Simon Ares. The station was Janus.
The design was perfect.

"No," he said. "I trusted the design."

"And that trust — that faith in perfection — is exactly what I was
afraid of. You see, Mr. Geary? Perfection makes people stop
looking. It makes them complacent. A perfect building makes its
caretakers lazy, because there is nothing to care for. My flaw was
meant to prevent that. Instead, the perfection of everything else
hid the flaw so completely that no one ever looked for it."

He coughed — a dry, shallow sound. Dr. Okafor, who had been standing
silently by the door, moved toward the bed, but Ares waved her away.

"Fix it," he said to Geary. "Fix the spindle. Make it Grade Nine.
And then — if I may make one last request — do not make it perfect.
Leave something else. Something small, something harmless, something
that requires attention. A joint that needs tightening every year.
A panel that must be replaced every decade. Something that says to
the people who live here: this building is alive, and it needs you."

Geary looked at the old man — the creator, the builder, the madman
who had put a crack in the heart of his masterpiece because he
was afraid of his own genius. And he understood, in a way that he
would spend years trying to articulate, that Ares was right and
wrong at the same time, and that the rightness and the wrongness
were inseparable, like the two helices of the station itself,
spiraling together around a shared axis.

"I'll fix it," he said. "And I'll leave something. But it'll be
my choice, not yours. And it won't endanger anyone."

Ares smiled. It was a thin, tired smile, but it carried within it
a relief so profound that it changed his face entirely — from the
mask of a man carrying a terrible weight to the face of a man who
had finally, after twenty-eight years, set it down.

"Thank you," he said.

                               IV.

Simon Ares died four days later, peacefully, in his room overlooking
the Grand Atrium. He was ninety-one years old.

The repair operation began the following week. Geary's team reduced
the station's spin rate to sixty percent, installed temporary
load-bearing supports around the affected section of the spindle,
and began the delicate process of cutting away the Grade Seven
sheath and replacing it with Grade Nine alloy fabricated on-station.

The work took five weeks. During that time, Janus Station lived at
reduced gravity — children bounced higher in the playgrounds, water
behaved oddly in the sinks, and everyone walked with the slightly
cautious gait of people who were not quite sure of their weight.
The station's residents had been told the truth — Vasquez had
insisted on transparency, over Ames's objections — and they had
responded with a mixture of shock, anger, and, eventually, a quiet
kind of pride. They were fixing their home. They were the caretakers
that Ares had always wanted them to be.

When the last section of Grade Nine sheath was welded into place,
Geary stood in the axial maintenance corridor and ran his hand
along the new metal. It was smooth, dense, perfect. The spindle
was whole. The station was safe.

He reached into his toolkit and pulled out a small steel plate —
a cover panel for an access port in the corridor wall. It was
standard equipment, unremarkable in every way, except that he had
drilled four mounting holes where the specification called for six.

Four holes would hold the panel in place indefinitely under normal
conditions. But the panel would rattle slightly in high-vibration
events — docking operations, thruster firings, the occasional
micrometeorite impact — and the rattle would be audible from the
corridor outside. Someone would hear it. Someone would investigate.
Someone would find the panel, see that it had four holes instead of
six, and add the missing bolts.

And then, a few years later, another panel somewhere else in the
station would develop a similar rattle. Because Geary planned to
install several of them, in different locations, over the course of
his remaining career. Small imperfections. Harmless. Fixable.
Detectable.

Invitations to pay attention.

He mounted the panel on the wall, tightened the four bolts, and
stepped back to listen. In the quiet of the corridor, he could
hear it — the faintest vibration, barely perceptible, a tiny sound
that said: I'm here. I need you. Look closer.

He smiled, and went back to work.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                      WHY BOTHER?

                        by Franklin Hoyt

================================================================================

                               I.

The last irrational man on Earth was eating breakfast when the world
ended.

Not ended in the dramatic sense — no fire from the sky, no sudden
silence, no horsemen. The world ended the way worlds actually end:
with a memo. Specifically, a memo from the Global Rationality
Commission to all citizens of the Consolidated Republic, distributed
at 0600 Universal Standard Time to every neural interface on the
planet, informing them that the Commission had, after careful and
fully rational deliberation, concluded that human civilization was
no longer a viable enterprise and would be phased out over the
following eighteen months.

Earl Tremaine did not receive the memo because Earl Tremaine did
not have a neural interface. He was, as far as anyone knew, the
only adult human being on Earth who lacked one. This was not by
choice — or rather, it was not by his choice. It was an oversight.

Earl was fifty-seven years old, lived alone in a three-room
apartment in what had once been called Baltimore, and worked as a
custodian at the Chesapeake Reclamation Facility, a water treatment
plant that served the mid-Atlantic region. He was a quiet man,
heavyset, with large hands and a face that defaulted to an
expression of mild bewilderment. He had been born in 2041, two
years before the Rationality Initiative was passed by the first
World Parliament, mandating neural modification for all citizens to
eliminate irrational cognitive biases.

Earl had been scheduled for modification at age three, like every
other child. But on the day of his appointment, a power failure
at the modification clinic in Baltimore had shut down the procedure
queue, and Earl's appointment had been rescheduled for the following
week. The following week, his mother — a woman of disorganized
temperament who would herself have benefited enormously from
modification, had she not received hers a year earlier — forgot
the new appointment. The system generated a follow-up reminder,
which was routed to an incorrect address. A second follow-up was
lost in a database migration. A third was flagged as duplicate and
deleted.

And so Earl Tremaine, through a cascade of small bureaucratic
failures, slipped through the net. He grew up unmodified — his
neurons firing in the messy, biased, emotionally contaminated
patterns that evolution had designed and that the Rationality
Initiative had been created to correct. He went to school, where
his modified classmates found him confusing but not threatening.
He got a job. He paid his taxes. He lived his life. And nobody
noticed, because nobody was looking.

Nobody was looking because nobody believed it was possible. The
neural modification system was, in the language of the Commission,
"comprehensive and error-free." Every citizen was modified. Every
citizen was rational. The idea that someone might have been missed
was, to a rational mind, not worth considering.

Earl ate his breakfast — eggs, toast, coffee — and listened to the
morning news on his radio. He was one of the few people who still
owned a radio. He found the sound of it comforting in a way he
couldn't quite explain. The neural interface broadcasts that
everyone else received were efficient and information-dense, but
they lacked something — a quality of warmth, of human imperfection,
that Earl's unmodified brain craved the way a body craves salt.

The morning news was strange.

"...the Commission's recommendation has been received and processed
by the World Parliament," said the newsreader, in the calm, measured
tones that all newsreaders used these days — rational tones, empty
of emphasis or emotion. "Implementation protocols are being
developed. Citizens are advised to consult their regional
administration offices for detailed phase-out schedules. The
Commission emphasizes that the decision was reached through rigorous
cost-benefit analysis and represents the optimal outcome given
current parameters."

Earl frowned. He turned up the volume.

"...the Commission's analysis indicates that the aggregate
resource expenditure required to maintain human civilization exceeds
the aggregate utility produced by a factor of three point seven.
Contributing factors include ecological degradation, infrastructure
maintenance costs, and the persistent failure of social systems to
achieve stable equilibrium. The Commission concludes that a
controlled phase-out of civilization, including managed population
reduction and systematic dismantling of infrastructure, would
reduce net suffering by approximately ninety-four percent over a
two-hundred-year horizon..."

Earl set down his coffee cup. He was not a sophisticated man. He
had not attended university. He did not understand cost-benefit
analysis or stable equilibrium or aggregate utility. But he
understood, with the immediate, gut-level clarity that his
unmodified brain was still capable of, that what the radio was
describing was the end of everything.

And that nobody else seemed to think this was a problem.

                               II.

He went to work. He didn't know what else to do.

The Chesapeake Reclamation Facility was a large, clean, efficiently
run installation on the shore of the bay. Earl's job was to maintain
the physical plant — the pipes, pumps, filters, and treatment
chambers that processed the region's wastewater and returned it to
the bay as clean water. It was a job that required no neural
interface and no particular rationality, just a strong back, a good
set of tools, and the willingness to do unpleasant work that more
rational people had decided was beneath them.

He arrived at 0700 and found the facility operating normally. The
other workers — six technicians and a shift supervisor, all
modified — were at their stations, doing their jobs with the calm,
unhurried efficiency that characterized everything modified people
did. None of them seemed disturbed by the morning's announcement.

Earl approached the shift supervisor, a man named Chen, who was
reviewing flow rates on a monitor.

"Did you hear the news?" Earl asked.

"Yes," Chen said, without looking up.

"They're shutting down civilization."

"The Commission has recommended a managed phase-out, yes. The
analysis is sound. The resource expenditure figures are
incontrovertible."

"But — people will die."

Chen looked at him then, with the patient, slightly puzzled
expression that modified people used when confronted with an
emotional statement. It was the expression of someone encountering
a logical error and trying to locate it.

"Death is an inevitable outcome in any scenario," Chen said.
"The question is whether more people will die through the
continuation of civilization or through its controlled conclusion.
The Commission's analysis indicates the latter option produces
less aggregate suffering."

"But we built all this," Earl said, gesturing at the facility
around them. "We built — everything. The cities. The farms. The
hospitals. We built all of it. And they want to tear it down."

"The infrastructure will be dismantled in an orderly fashion.
Essential services will be maintained during the transition period
to minimize hardship."

"That's not what I mean."

"Then I do not understand what you mean."

Earl opened his mouth to explain, and found that he couldn't. Not
because the explanation was complicated, but because it required
something that Chen did not have — something that had been carefully
and deliberately removed from his brain when he was three years
old. It required the capacity to feel that something was wrong,
not because the numbers said so, but because it felt wrong. Because
the gut clenched and the heart rate spiked and a voice in the back
of the brain screamed no, not this, not ever, not while I'm
breathing.

Earl had that capacity. Chen did not.

"Never mind," Earl said. He went to work on the pipes.

                               * * *

The days that followed were the strangest of Earl's life. The world
continued to function — people went to work, services operated,
the infrastructure hummed along — but beneath the surface of
normalcy, the dismantling had begun.

He saw it in small things at first. Government offices began
closing, their functions "consolidated" or "phased out." Schools
announced that the current semester would be the last. Hospitals
reduced their services, transferring patients to "transition care
facilities" that Earl did not want to think too hard about.

And nobody protested. Nobody objected. Nobody stood in the streets
and shouted that this was wrong, because nobody felt that it was
wrong. The rational brain of every modified citizen on Earth had
received the Commission's analysis, processed it, verified its
logic, and accepted its conclusions. The numbers were correct.
Civilization was a net negative. Shutting it down was the optimal
choice.

Earl watched this happen the way a man watches a fire approach
from across a field — with the sick, helpless certainty that it
was coming for him and that nobody around him could see the flames.

He tried talking to people. His neighbors, his coworkers, the woman
at the grocery store who still sold food because the food
distribution system had not yet been phased out. He said: This is
wrong. This is insane. We can't just stop being a civilization.
And they looked at him with that patient, puzzled expression and
said: The analysis is sound. The numbers are clear. Why are you
upset?

And he couldn't explain. Not in terms they could understand. Because
the terms they understood were rational terms — numbers, analyses,
cost-benefit calculations — and the thing Earl felt was not rational.
It was irrational. It was a howl in the dark, a fist slammed on a
table, a voice saying: No. Not because I can prove you wrong. But
because I refuse. Because this matters. Because we matter. Because
I would rather live in a civilization that costs too much than die
in an efficient void.

But who would listen to the last irrational man on Earth?

                               III.

On the fourteenth day after the announcement, Earl did something
that he would later describe as "not really a plan, more like a
tantrum."

He went to the World Parliament building in Geneva.

Getting there was surprisingly easy. The transportation systems
were still running — they were among the last services scheduled
for phase-out, since people needed to move around during the
transition period. Earl took a maglev from Baltimore to New York,
a suborbital from New York to Geneva, and a local transit pod from
the Geneva station to the Parliament complex. Nobody stopped him.
Nobody asked where he was going or why. The security systems
scanned his biometrics, noted the absence of a neural interface,
flagged it as an anomaly, and — because the security staff who
monitored the flags had rationally concluded that security was no
longer a priority in a civilization that was being phased out —
did nothing.

The Parliament building was a vast, crystalline structure that
floated above Lake Geneva on anti-gravity pylons — a monument to
human engineering and ambition that was, according to the
Commission's analysis, scheduled for dismantling in Month Seven
of the phase-out. Earl walked through the main entrance, past the
empty information desk, through the silent corridors, and into the
Grand Assembly Hall.

The hall was enormous — tiered seating for two thousand delegates,
a raised dais at the front, holographic display systems that could
project information at any scale. It was empty. The World Parliament
had voted to accept the Commission's recommendation three days
after it was issued, by a margin of 1,947 to zero, with fifty-three
abstentions on procedural grounds. Having voted to end civilization,
the delegates had gone home. There was nothing left to legislate.

Earl stood in the empty hall and felt a surge of something that a
rational person would have identified as an inappropriate emotional
response to a suboptimal situation. Earl, being irrational, identified
it as fury.

He climbed the steps to the dais. He stood behind the speaker's
podium. He looked out at the empty seats and the silent displays
and the crystalline walls through which the waters of Lake Geneva
were visible, gray and cold and indifferent.

And he began to talk.

"My name is Earl Tremaine," he said. His voice echoed in the empty
hall. "I am a custodian from Baltimore. I clean pipes. I fix pumps.
I do the work that nobody else wants to do, and I've been doing it
for thirty-two years, and I'm going to keep doing it until somebody
gives me a reason to stop that I actually believe.

"You — all of you, every modified, rational, optimized citizen of
this perfectly logical world — you've decided that civilization isn't
worth the trouble. You've run the numbers. The numbers say we're a
bad investment. Too expensive. Too wasteful. Too messy. And because
you can't feel anything about it — because somebody took away your
ability to feel — you're going along with it. You're dismantling
everything we've ever built, everything our grandparents built,
everything their grandparents built, because a spreadsheet says it's
the smart move.

"Well, I'm here to tell you that the spreadsheet is wrong. Not
because I can find the error in the math. I can't. I never got past
algebra. But the spreadsheet is wrong because it's asking the wrong
question. It's asking whether civilization is worth the cost. That's
the wrong question. The right question is whether civilization is
worth fighting for, and the answer is yes, and the reason is because
— because —"

He stopped. He gripped the edges of the podium and stared at the
empty seats and tried to find the words for something that words
could not contain.

"Because my mother used to sing to me," he said. "She had a terrible
voice. Couldn't carry a tune. She'd sing while she was cooking
dinner, these old songs that her mother had taught her, and she was
awful, she was just awful, and it was the most beautiful sound in
the world. And no spreadsheet, no cost-benefit analysis, no rational
optimization of aggregate utility will ever account for that. Will
ever explain why a woman with a terrible voice singing a song she
learned from her mother while she burns the chicken is worth more
than all the efficiency in the universe.

"That's what you lost. That's what they took from you. Not your
intelligence. Not your logic. Your ability to know, without proof,
without data, without analysis, that some things are worth keeping.
That some things are worth fighting for. That civilization is not
a cost. It's a gift. It's the greatest thing we've ever made, and
it's messy and wasteful and illogical and glorious, and if you
tear it down, there will be nothing left — nothing — because the
universe doesn't care about us, and we are the only ones who do."

He stopped talking. His voice had been rising, filling the empty
hall, bouncing off the crystalline walls. In the silence that
followed, he could hear his own breathing, harsh and unsteady, and
the faint hum of the building's systems, still running, still
maintaining a structure that had been condemned.

He did not know that the building's internal broadcast system was
still active. He did not know that his words had been transmitted,
automatically, to every neural interface on the planet — a default
function of the Parliament's communication array, designed to
ensure that all citizens could hear proceedings in the Grand
Assembly Hall.

Seven billion people heard Earl Tremaine.

Seven billion perfectly rational people, who had accepted the
end of civilization with the calm equanimity of minds unclouded
by emotion, heard a man with a terrible education and no neural
interface stand in an empty hall and shout about his mother's
singing voice.

And something happened.

                               IV.

Later, the scientists would try to explain it. The rational mind,
they said, was not a closed system. It was a mind, after all — a
biological organ shaped by millions of years of evolution, modified
but not replaced by the neural interface. The modification
suppressed certain cognitive patterns: emotional reasoning, irrational
attachment, intuitive valuation of experiences that could not be
quantified. But it did not destroy them. They were still there,
buried beneath the rational architecture, like seeds beneath concrete.

Earl Tremaine's speech — raw, unpolished, illogical, and radiating
an emotional intensity that no modified person had been exposed to
in decades — cracked the concrete.

Not for everyone. Not immediately. But for enough people, and fast
enough, to matter.

The first reports came from Geneva itself. Three Commission members
— the very officials who had authored the phase-out recommendation —
contacted the Parliament's emergency office within two hours of
Earl's speech. Their communications were unusual: they were, for
the first time in any of their careers, uncertain. They used words
like "reconsider" and "re-evaluate" and, most remarkably,
"uncomfortable." Discomfort was not a rational category. Discomfort
was an emotion.

In Baltimore, Earl's coworker Chen arrived at the Reclamation
Facility the next morning and stood for a long time looking at the
treatment chambers — the pipes, the filters, the pumps — the
infrastructure that cleaned the water that people drank. He had
processed the Commission's recommendation. He had accepted its
logic. But now, standing in the facility, he found himself thinking
a thought that he could not account for rationally: I don't want
this to stop.

He could not explain why. The "why" was not in his rational
architecture. It was somewhere else — somewhere deeper, somewhere
the modification had not reached, somewhere that a man's voice,
echoing in an empty hall, had found and shaken loose.

In Mumbai, a hospital administrator who had been processing the
closure of her facility stopped in mid-form and looked up. She
looked at the patients in the ward. She looked at the nurses. She
looked at the monitoring systems keeping people alive. She put down
her pen.

"We're not closing," she said.

"The phase-out schedule—" her deputy began.

"I know what the schedule says. We're not closing."

"That is not rational."

"No," she said. "It is not."

In São Paulo, a teacher who had been told that today was the last
day of school walked into her classroom, looked at the twenty-three
children sitting at their desks, and taught the lesson anyway. When
the principal asked why, she said, "Because they need to learn," and
could not articulate what she meant by "need," and did not care.

In a thousand cities, in ten thousand buildings, in a hundred
thousand small and unremarkable interactions, the crack spread.
People who had accepted the end of everything began, slowly and
confusingly, to resist. Not with arguments — they had no arguments
that could match the Commission's logic. Not with analysis — the
analysis still said what it had always said. But with something older
than analysis, something more fundamental than logic, something that
had been buried but not killed: the stubborn, irrational, gloriously
unreasonable conviction that the world was worth keeping.

                               V.

The World Parliament reconvened six weeks later. The Grand Assembly
Hall was full — every seat occupied, the galleries packed, the
corridors overflowing. Earl Tremaine was not invited. He found out
about the session from his radio.

The debate lasted four days. It was, by all accounts, the most
extraordinary legislative proceeding in the Parliament's history —
not because of the arguments, which were familiar, but because of
their character. For the first time, delegates spoke with
uncertainty. They qualified their statements. They contradicted
themselves. They argued — not the polished, logical exchanges that
had characterized parliamentary discourse for decades, but messy,
emotional, sometimes incoherent arguments that lurched between
data and feeling, between analysis and conviction, between the
rational architecture that still governed most of their thinking and
the something else that had been awakened beneath it.

On the fourth day, the Parliament voted to rescind the phase-out
recommendation, by a margin of 1,612 to 388. The vote was not
unanimous. Three hundred and eighty-eight delegates remained fully
convinced that the Commission's analysis was correct, and they
were, strictly speaking, right. The numbers had not changed. The
cost-benefit calculation still showed civilization as a net negative.

But the majority had concluded — irrationally, illogically,
beautifully — that the cost-benefit calculation was not the point.

The Commission was disbanded. The neural modification program was
not repealed — that would take years of additional debate, and the
question of whether modification should be reversed was far more
complex than the question of whether civilization should be
maintained — but a new exception was added to the mandate: a
provision allowing individuals to request partial de-modification,
restoring certain suppressed cognitive functions, including
emotional reasoning.

In the first month, twelve million people applied.

                               * * *

Earl Tremaine went back to Baltimore and went back to work. He did
not become famous, exactly — the modified media had difficulty
knowing what to do with a story that was, at its core, about the
triumph of irrationality. But he was recognized, occasionally, by
people who had heard his speech. They would stop him on the street,
or in the grocery store, or at the Reclamation Facility, and they
would say thank you, and he would nod and say you're welcome and
change the subject, because he was not a man who was comfortable
with gratitude.

Chen, his coworker, was one of the first to apply for de-
modification. The process took three months. When it was complete,
he came back to work at the Facility and stood beside Earl at the
treatment chambers, watching the water flow through the filters,
and for the first time in his life, he felt something about it. Not
a calculation. Not an analysis. A feeling. A sense that the water
was clean and that clean water mattered and that the work of making
it clean was, in some way that no number could express, good.

"This is very inefficient," he said, watching the water.

"What is?"

"Feeling things. It takes up enormous cognitive resources. The
emotional processing alone requires—" He stopped himself. He looked
at Earl and smiled — an unfamiliar expression on his face, awkward
and uncertain and completely genuine.

"It's nice, though," he said.

Earl looked at the water. He looked at Chen. He looked at the
Facility — the pipes, the pumps, the filters, the entire beautiful,
wasteful, essential apparatus of civilization maintaining itself,
one day at a time, for no rational reason at all.

"Yeah," he said. "It is."

He went back to work. The pumps hummed. The water flowed. The world,
imperfect and irrational and stubbornly, magnificently alive,
continued.

                            STELLAR CRUCIBLE

                      by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                               I.

The furnace reached operational temperature at 3:47 AM on a Tuesday,
and Dr. Sera Navarro was the only person awake to see it.

She sat at the monitoring console in Laboratory Nine of the
Prometheus Materials Research Facility, a government installation
buried in the granite bedrock of the Colorado Rockies, and watched
the temperature readings climb with the careful attention of a
woman who understood, with precision, what those numbers meant.

One hundred million degrees. The surface temperature of a blue
supergiant star. At this temperature, atoms lost their electron
shells and existed as bare nuclei in a plasma so energetic that
it would vaporize any known material in microseconds. The only
thing containing it was a magnetic confinement field of a design
that Navarro had spent seven years developing — a nested
architecture of superconducting electromagnets that held the plasma
in a suspended sphere, twelve centimeters in diameter, floating in
the center of a vacuum chamber that was itself surrounded by three
meters of lead shielding, water cooling jackets, and enough
monitoring equipment to fill a small building.

Stellar Crucible. That was what the team called it. Not the official
designation — the official designation was the Extreme Temperature
Materials Synthesis Platform, a name that had been generated by a
committee and that no one used. Stellar Crucible was simpler, more honest.
A kiln was a place where you put raw material in and took something
new out. That was what they were doing. That was the entire point.

Two hundred million degrees. Navarro adjusted the magnetic
confinement parameters — a series of fine corrections to the field
geometry that kept the plasma sphere stable as the temperature
increased. The adjustments were calculated by the facility's
computer, but Navarro made them by hand, entering each value
individually, checking each result against her models before
proceeding. She did not trust automation with temperatures that
exceeded the cores of most stars. The margin for error was not
narrow. There was no margin at all.

"Confinement stable," she said, to the recording system that logged
every word spoken in the laboratory. "Plasma density nominal.
Approaching target temperature."

Five hundred million degrees. The temperature at the center of a
massive star during carbon fusion. At these temperatures, the
electromagnetic force that held atomic nuclei apart began to weaken
relative to the strong nuclear force that pulled them together. Nuclei
that would never interact under normal conditions could be driven
close enough to fuse — to combine into new configurations, new
elements, new forms of matter that did not exist in nature outside
the hearts of dying stars.

That was what the Kiln was for. Not to generate energy — fusion
reactors did that, efficiently and at much lower temperatures. The
Kiln was for synthesis. For creation. For making things that had
never existed before.

Navarro watched the temperature reach seven hundred million degrees
and stabilized the confinement field. The plasma sphere glowed on
the monitoring display — a false-color image rendered from sensor
data, since no human eye could survive a direct view — and it was
beautiful. A tiny sun, held in a cage of magnetic force, burning
at temperatures that would consume a planet.

She opened the feed system. A precisely measured quantity of raw
material — a mixture of heavy elements, carefully selected for
their nuclear properties — entered the plasma sphere through a
magnetic injection channel. The material vaporized instantly, its
atoms stripped of electrons, its nuclei driven into the plasma's
heart.

And there, in the unimaginable heat, something happened.

The nuclei fused. Not in the statistical, probabilistic way that
fusion occurred in stars — the slow, patient process of quantum
tunneling that powered the universe on timescales of billions of
years. This was directed fusion. Controlled. Intentional. The
magnetic confinement geometry channeled the plasma's energy into
specific interaction volumes, driving nuclei together with a force
and frequency that nature achieved only in the hearts of supernovae.

On the monitoring display, new spectral lines appeared — lines that
did not match any element in the periodic table. Lines that
corresponded to nuclear configurations that had never been observed
in any laboratory, any star, any supernova remnant, anywhere in the
catalogued universe.

Navarro stared at the display. Her hands were steady on the console.
Her heart rate, she noted with the detached precision of a scientist
observing her own body, was one hundred and forty-two beats per
minute.

"New spectral signature detected," she said to the recorder. "Nuclear
configuration does not match any known element or isotope.
Preliminary analysis suggests a stable transuranic nucleus with
— " She paused, checking the data. "With a proton count of one
hundred and sixty-four."

Element 164. An island of stability in the sea of radioactive
instability that characterized the transuranic elements. Theorized
for decades. Never synthesized. Never observed. A mathematical
prediction, a physicist's dream, a number on a chart that said:
here, if you could get here, matter would be stable again. New
elements. New materials. New possibilities.

She had gotten there.

"Initiating extraction sequence," she said.

The magnetic confinement field reconfigured, channeling the newly
formed nuclei out of the plasma sphere and into a cooling chamber
where they could capture electrons and condense into solid matter.
The process took fourteen minutes. At the end of it, Navarro opened
the cooling chamber and found, resting on the ceramic collection
plate, a small object.

It was a bead. Perhaps three millimeters in diameter. It was dark —
not the darkness of an absence of light, but a deep, saturated
darkness, like the color of a sky just after sunset, before the
stars appear. It was smooth and perfectly spherical, and it was warm
to the touch — not hot, but warm, as though it contained a gentle,
persistent source of heat.

And it was glowing.

Not brightly. Not like a lamp or a phosphorescent compound. It
emitted a soft, steady light — a luminescence without visible source
or explanation. The light was warm in color, tending toward gold,
and it seemed to come from the bead's interior, as though the
material itself were lit from within.

Navarro held it in her gloved hand and looked at it. The light
played across her fingers, casting tiny shadows on her palm. She
brought it close to her face. The warmth was constant, unchanging.
She placed it on the console, in a patch of shadow, and the glow
continued — steady, patient, undeniable.

A new element. A stable transuranic nucleus. And it emitted light.

Without energy input. Without decay. Without any mechanism that
current physics could account for.

She sat down heavily in her chair and stared at the bead, and for
a long time she said nothing at all.

                               II.

By morning, the laboratory was full.

Navarro had spent the intervening hours running every diagnostic
she could devise. The bead — she had started thinking of it as
"the bead," a name that was inadequate but serviceable — had been
subjected to spectroscopic analysis, mass spectrometry, X-ray
diffraction, and calorimetric measurement. The results were
consistent and bewildering.

Element 164 was real. The nucleus was stable — no detectable
radioactive decay over six hours of continuous monitoring. The
atomic mass was 427.3 atomic mass units. The crystalline structure
was face-centered cubic, similar to gold but with a lattice
constant that did not match any known material. The density was
approximately 24 grams per cubic centimeter — heavier than osmium,
the densest naturally occurring element.

And it glowed. The luminescence was constant — 0.3 watts, measured
at the surface, in a broad spectrum peaked at 580 nanometers. The
energy output did not diminish over time. Calorimetric analysis
confirmed that the bead was producing heat as well as light,
at a steady rate of approximately 0.4 watts. The total energy
output — light plus heat — was 0.7 watts, continuous, with no
detectable input.

The laws of thermodynamics had a clear opinion about objects that
produced energy without input. Navarro was familiar with these laws.
She had spent her career working within them. The bead did not care
about her familiarity.

"It's not magic," she told her team, standing at the whiteboard in
the laboratory's briefing room with the data displayed behind her.
"There is a physical mechanism. We simply do not understand it yet."

The team — six researchers, each an expert in nuclear physics,
materials science, or high-energy plasma dynamics — looked at the
data with the expressions of people who had been trained to be
skeptical and were now confronting something that made skepticism
feel inadequate.

"Could it be residual energy from the synthesis process?" asked
Dr. David Osei, the team's nuclear physicist. He was a careful,
methodical man who distrusted excitement in science, considering
it a precursor to error. "Stored energy in the nuclear
configuration, releasing slowly?"

"The energy budget doesn't work," Navarro said. "The total energy
input during synthesis was approximately forty megajoules. At the
current output rate of 0.7 watts, the bead has already emitted more
energy than it received. And the output is not decreasing."

"Then where is the energy coming from?"

"I don't know."

The words sat in the room like a dropped tool, heavy and final.
I don't know. Three words that every scientist understood, and
three words that every scientist dreaded, because they meant that
the comfortable framework within which they understood the universe
had developed a crack.

"What about the light?" asked Dr. Min-Ji Park, the team's
spectroscopist. "The emission spectrum is unusual — it's too smooth
for fluorescence, too broad for a laser, and the peak wavelength
doesn't correspond to any known electronic transition in any known
element."

"Because it's not a known element," Navarro said. "Element 164
does not exist in nature. Its electronic structure is entirely
novel. The transitions are novel. The emission is novel. Everything
about this material is new."

"Beautiful, too," said Park, who had a tendency toward aesthetic
observations that her colleagues found either charming or irritating,
depending on their mood. "The color. Have you noticed? It's the
exact color of candlelight."

Navarro had noticed. She did not say so. She was a precise woman,
trained in the austere disciplines of high-energy physics and
materials science, and she was uncomfortable with beauty as a
category of analysis. But Park was right. The bead's light was
warm, gentle, and deeply appealing in a way that had nothing to
do with spectroscopy and everything to do with the human eye's
long evolutionary relationship with fire.

Candlelight. Starlight. The light of something burning, given
freely, without consumption.

                               III.

Navarro made a second bead the following week. And a third. Each
synthesis required the full output of the Kiln — sixteen hours of
preparation, eight hours of sustained operation at seven hundred
million degrees, fourteen minutes of extraction and cooling. Each
bead was identical: three millimeters, perfectly spherical, dark
and warm and glowing.

She arranged them on her desk — three tiny suns, casting their
golden light across her papers and her coffee cup and the framed
photograph of her daughter that she kept beside her monitor. The
light was gentle enough to read by. The warmth was enough to feel
on her skin from half a meter away.

Three beads. 2.1 watts. A trivial amount of energy by any
industrial standard. But 2.1 watts, continuous, with no fuel, no
input, no mechanism that anyone could explain.

The Department of Energy sent a team. They measured. They analyzed.
They wrote a report. The report said, in the carefully hedged
language of government science, that the phenomenon was "anomalous"
and "warranted further investigation."

Navarro read the report and set it aside. She knew what she had
made. She knew what it meant. The hedged language was a bureaucratic
reflex, the institutional equivalent of blinking. The reality was
simpler and more alarming: she had created something that should
not exist, and it was sitting on her desk, glowing.

She made a fourth bead, and a fifth. The facility's director,
Dr. Raymond Cross, began asking questions about energy consumption
and resource allocation. Stellar Crucible used enormous amounts of power —
the magnetic confinement system drew thirty megawatts during
operation, enough to power a small city. Five beads producing a
total of 3.5 watts represented a return on investment that was, by
any rational measure, absurd.

But Navarro was not interested in the energy budget. She was
interested in the material. Element 164 was something genuinely
new — a form of matter that had never existed in the fourteen-
billion-year history of the universe, created in a laboratory in
Colorado by a woman with a magnetic confinement field and a very
hot furnace. It was the alchemist's dream, the philosopher's stone,
the transmutation of base matter into something unprecedented.

And it glowed.

She began experimenting with the material's properties. It was
extraordinarily hard — harder than diamond, resistant to scratching
by any tool in the laboratory. It was chemically inert, reacting
with nothing at room temperature and resisting corrosion by every
acid and solvent she tried. It was a superconductor at room
temperature — a property so remarkable that, under normal
circumstances, it would have been the discovery of the century.
But it was overshadowed by the luminescence, which remained the
material's most visible and most inexplicable characteristic.

She made a ring of the beads — twelve of them, arranged in a
circle on a ceramic tray. The combined light was strong enough to
illuminate the entire laboratory. Warm, golden, steady. The
researchers began turning off the fluorescent ceiling lights and
working by bead-light. It was easier on the eyes, they said.
More pleasant. More natural.

Park made the observation that Navarro had been avoiding.

"It's Promethean," she said one evening, as they sat in the
bead-lit laboratory, reviewing data.

"Meaning?"

"Promethean. As in Prometheus. The Titan who stole fire from the
gods and gave it to humanity. You've made fire, Sera. Not a fire
that burns fuel. A fire that just — burns. Light and heat, forever,
from nothing. It's the oldest dream in the world."

"It's a nuclear phenomenon," Navarro said. "Not a myth."

"It's both. Every great discovery is both. The atomic bomb was both
physics and myth — the myth of the sun brought to earth. DNA was
both chemistry and myth — the myth of the book of life. You've
made perpetual fire. The physics will be explained eventually. The
myth is already here."

Navarro looked at the beads, their golden light playing across
Park's face, and said nothing. She was a physicist. She dealt in
measurements, equations, reproducible phenomena. Myths were for
other people.

But the beads glowed, and the light was warm, and somewhere in
the back of her rigorously trained mind, a very old part of her
brain — the part that had sat around fires in caves, the part that
had looked up at the stars and wondered — that part knew what
Park meant.

                               IV.

The second creation happened six weeks later, and it was not
planned.

Navarro had been experimenting with variations in the synthesis
parameters — adjusting the plasma temperature, the confinement
geometry, the composition of the feed material — to explore the
range of possible products. Most variations produced nothing useful:
unstable isotopes that decayed in microseconds, radioactive waste,
or simply failed fusions that scattered the feed material across
the chamber walls.

But on the morning of November 3rd, running a synthesis at a
slightly elevated temperature — eight hundred million degrees,
one hundred million above the standard protocol — with a modified
feed mixture that included a small percentage of lighter elements,
she produced something different.

The extraction process was normal. The cooling was normal. She
opened the collection chamber and found, resting on the ceramic
plate, not a bead but a filament.

It was thin — perhaps a tenth of a millimeter in diameter — and
approximately four centimeters long. It was dark, like the beads,
but its surface had a different quality: not smooth but textured, as
though it had been grown rather than formed. It was warm. It glowed.

And it moved.

Not dramatically. Not like an animal or a machine. It moved the
way a plant moves in time-lapse photography — slowly, steadily,
extending one end outward while the other remained fixed to the
ceramic plate. It was growing. Producing new material from — from
what? There was nothing to grow from. The collection chamber was
empty except for the filament itself. And yet the filament was
extending, adding to its length at a rate of approximately one
millimeter per hour.

Navarro watched it for three hours, measuring its growth, analyzing
the material it was producing. The new material was identical to
the original — same element, same crystalline structure, same
luminescence. The filament was replicating itself. Creating new
matter. Adding mass.

From nothing.

She checked the energy readings. The filament's luminous output
was higher than the beads' — approximately 2 watts per centimeter
of length. And it was drawing no external energy. No heat, no
radiation, no electromagnetic input. It was generating matter and
energy simultaneously, from no detectable source.

The laws of conservation of energy and conservation of mass — the
two pillars upon which all of physics rested — were, in this small
ceramic chamber in a laboratory in Colorado, being violated.

Or they were being supplemented by something that no one had
previously observed. A source of energy and matter that was not
accounted for in the standard model. A mechanism so fundamental
and so unfamiliar that it had no name.

Navarro sealed the collection chamber and locked it. She stood
outside the chamber for a long time, her hands flat against the
cool metal surface, feeling the faint warmth that radiated from
inside.

Then she called Cross.

"We have a problem," she said.

                               * * *

The problem was not the physics. The physics, however bewildering,
was at least observable, measurable, subject to analysis. The
problem was containment.

The filament continued to grow. By the end of the first day, it was
eight centimeters long. By the end of the second, twelve. By the
end of the third, it had reached the wall of the collection chamber
and begun growing along the surface, following the curvature of
the metal, adhering to it with a grip that resisted all attempts
at removal.

"It's bonding to the chamber wall," Navarro told Cross, in a
meeting that also included the facility's safety officer, a stern
woman named Captain Torres who had been seconded from the Air
Force. "The material is integrating with the metal substrate at
the molecular level. It's — for lack of a better word — eating
the chamber."

"Eating?" Torres said.

"Converting. The chamber wall is a nickel-chromium alloy. The
filament is converting the nickel and chromium atoms into Element
164. It's using the chamber wall as feed material."

"And growing."

"And growing."

Torres looked at the monitoring display, which showed the filament
— now more of a web, branching and spreading across the interior
of the collection chamber like frost on a windowpane. The golden
glow illuminated the chamber's interior, casting intricate shadows
through the web's lattice.

"Can we stop it?" Torres asked.

"We can try. Extreme cold might slow the conversion process.
But—"

"But?"

"But I don't know what will happen when the chamber is fully
converted. The filament is consuming the containment itself. When
the containment is gone, the filament will be in contact with
the rest of the laboratory infrastructure."

The room was quiet.

"How fast is it growing?" Cross asked.

"The growth rate is accelerating. Doubling approximately every
eighteen hours."

Cross did the calculation in his head. Navarro could see him do it,
could see the moment when the exponential curve crossed the
threshold from theoretical concern to practical emergency.

"Shut it down," he said. "Destroy the filament. Whatever it takes."

"The material is harder than diamond. It resists every cutting tool
we have. It's impervious to chemical attack. It's a room-temperature
superconductor, which means we can't use electromagnetic disruption.
The only thing that might work is extreme heat — returning it to
plasma in the Kiln."

"Then do it."

"Stellar Crucible is designed to create Element 164. Destroying it requires
the same temperatures. If I heat the filament to plasma
temperature while it's bonded to the chamber wall, I'll destroy
the chamber, the Kiln, and possibly the entire laboratory."

"Then we evacuate the laboratory, seal it, and let it consume
itself."

"Raymond, you're not listening. It's growing. Exponentially. If
it consumes the laboratory, it will reach the facility
infrastructure. If it consumes the facility infrastructure, it
will reach the bedrock. It will keep growing. It will keep
converting. And it will not stop, because it has no reason to
stop. It is doing what its physics demands: converting matter
into Element 164, producing energy, and expanding."

She paused. "I made a new kind of fire. And the first thing I
did with it — the very first thing — was set it loose."

                               V.

The solution, when it came, was not elegant. Navarro would have
preferred elegant. She was a physicist; elegance was a professional
value. But the situation did not permit elegance. It permitted
only speed.

The collection chamber was removed from the Kiln assembly — a
delicate, dangerous operation that required cutting the chamber's
mounting bolts with plasma torches while the filament inside
continued to grow. The chamber was transported, in a shielded
container, to the facility's deep storage vault — a chamber carved
into the bedrock two hundred meters below the laboratory, lined
with a ceramic composite that the filament could not convert
because it contained no metallic elements.

Navarro supervised the placement personally. The container was
lowered into the vault, sealed behind three layers of ceramic
doors, and monitored by remote sensors. The filament, deprived of
metallic feed material, slowed its growth. It did not stop — it
began, slowly, to convert the ceramic lining — but the rate was
orders of magnitude slower. Ceramic was not metal. The atomic
structures were more resistant to conversion. The doubling time
extended from eighteen hours to approximately six months.

Six months. Time to think. Time to study. Time to understand
what she had made and how to unmake it, if unmaking was possible.

Navarro stood at the monitoring console above the vault, watching
the remote sensors track the filament's slow progress through the
ceramic lining, and she thought about Prometheus.

The myth said that Prometheus stole fire from the gods and gave
it to humanity, and that the gods punished him by chaining him to
a rock and sending an eagle to eat his liver every day, and that
his liver grew back every night, and that the punishment was
eternal.

The myth was usually read as a story about the cost of knowledge.
About the price of bringing light to the darkness. But Navarro,
standing above a vault that contained a self-replicating element
that produced energy from nothing and consumed everything it
touched, thought the myth was about something else.

It was about the moment — the precise, irreversible moment — when
the fire leaves your hands. When the thing you created becomes
the thing that exists, independent of your will, beyond your
control, alive in the world with its own momentum and its own
imperatives.

She had made a new element. Beautiful and stable. A bead that
glowed with candlelight.

She had made a second thing. Beautiful and unstable. A filament
that grew and consumed and would not stop.

The beads sat in her office, on her desk, glowing their quiet
golden light. She looked at them often. She did not touch them.
She was no longer certain that they were safe. She was no longer
certain that anything she had made was safe. She had opened a
door into a room that physics had not previously explored, and
the first thing through the door had been light, and the second
thing had been hunger, and she did not know what the third thing
would be.

Stellar Crucible stood idle in Laboratory Nine, its magnetic confinement
field powered down, its plasma chamber cold and dark. Navarro had
not shut it down. She had simply stopped using it. She went to
the laboratory every morning and sat at her console and looked at
the numbers and did not turn it on.

Park came to see her on a Thursday afternoon, carrying two cups
of coffee and wearing the expression of a friend who has come to
say something difficult.

"Are you going to use it again?" she asked.

Navarro took the coffee. "I don't know."

"The beads are still glowing."

"Yes."

"They're still beautiful."

"Yes."

"And the filament is still growing."

"At a much slower rate. We have time."

"Time to do what?"

Navarro looked at her coffee. At the beads on her desk. At the
faint golden light that played across her hands. "Time to decide
whether the fire is worth the hunger."

Park sat down beside her. They drank their coffee in the bead-
light, and neither of them spoke, and the light glowed on, warm
and steady and free, asking nothing, giving everything, the
oldest gift in the world, still burning.

                            [THE END]

                        LILY'S EXTRA PLANET

                        by Danny Kowalski

================================================================================

                               I.

The crayons were the good kind — the big box with sixty-four
colors, including Burnt Sienna, which Lily Chen considered the
most important crayon in the box because it was the color of her
cat, Mr. Whiskers, back home on Earth.

She didn't have Mr. Whiskers anymore. He was staying with Grandma
in Portland while Lily and her parents lived on Orbital Station
Kepler, which was a big wheel in space that spun around so you
didn't float everywhere, and which had a school and a park and a
cafeteria and approximately zero cats, which was the main thing
wrong with it.

Lily was eight years old. She had straight black hair that her
mother cut in a bob, brown eyes that got very big when she was
excited, and a gap where her left front tooth had been until last
week when it fell out during a math lesson and she accidentally
swallowed it, which was disgusting and also meant she couldn't put
it under her pillow, which meant the tooth fairy owed her and she
intended to collect.

Right now, she was sitting at her desk in Mrs. Okafor's third-grade
classroom on Kepler Station, working on her entry for the Annual
Station Art Contest. The theme this year was "Our Solar System," and
Lily had decided to draw all the planets.

She had started with the sun, which she put in the bottom left
corner of the paper because that was where suns went, according to
every drawing she had ever made. The sun was yellow and orange and
red and had spiky things coming off it that were called — she
squinted, trying to remember what Mrs. Okafor had said — "solar
prominences," which was a very long word for spiky things.

Then she drew Mercury, which was small and gray and boring. Then
Venus, which was sort of yellow-white and had swirly clouds. Then
Earth, which she drew very carefully, with blue oceans and green
continents and white swirly clouds, and a tiny red dot where
Portland was, which was where Grandma and Mr. Whiskers lived, so
it was the most important place.

Then Mars. Then Jupiter, which took a long time because of the
stripes and the big red spot. Then Saturn with its rings, which
were her favorite thing about Saturn. Then Uranus, which was
blue-green and tilted sideways, which Lily thought was funny
because it looked like it had fallen over. Then Neptune, which
was dark blue and far away.

Then Pluto, which Mrs. Okafor said was not technically a planet
anymore but which Lily drew anyway because she felt sorry for it.

And then — she didn't know why — she kept going.

Past Pluto. Past the edge of what Mrs. Okafor's chart showed. Into
the space at the top right corner of her paper, where there was
nothing on any chart she had ever seen, and where she drew, with
steady, certain strokes of her Burnt Sienna crayon, another planet.

It was small — about the size of her Mars — and it was brown and
orange, like the crayon, with streaks of darker color that might
have been mountains or storms or something else entirely. She gave
it a thin ring, like Saturn's but narrower, and two small moons,
one on each side, like earrings.

She looked at it. She wasn't sure why she had drawn it. It had
just — come. The way things sometimes came when she was drawing:
not planned, not thought about, just there, arriving on the paper
through her hand as though it had been waiting for her to pick up
the right crayon.

She liked it. It looked right. It looked like it belonged there,
in that corner of the paper, past Pluto, where nobody had drawn
a planet before.

She wrote a label underneath it in her neatest handwriting: LILY'S
PLANET.

                               II.

The art contest entries were displayed in the station's main
concourse — a wide, curving corridor that ran around the station's
equator, lined with shops and offices and, this week, the artwork
of every student at Kepler Elementary. The drawings were taped to
the concourse walls at kid-height, a colorful band of rockets and
planets and aliens and stars that made the corridor look like the
inside of a kaleidoscope.

Lily's drawing was between Tommy Petersen's (a rocket ship with
flames shooting out the back and a stick figure waving from the
window — Tommy was not the best artist) and Sofia Gutierrez's
(a very detailed and accurate portrait of Jupiter's Great Red
Spot, because Sofia was going to be a scientist when she grew up
and wanted everyone to know it).

The judging would happen on Friday. Lily was not optimistic about
her chances — Sofia's Jupiter was really good — but she was proud
of her drawing, especially the sun's solar prominences and the
little red dot for Portland.

And Lily's Planet. She was especially proud of that.

She didn't think about it again until Thursday evening, when her
father came home from work.

James Chen was an astronomer. He worked in Kepler Station's
observatory, a large dome on the station's hub that housed a
telescope and a suite of instruments that he used to look at things
very far away. He was a quiet, gentle man who wore glasses and
forgot to comb his hair and sometimes stood in the kitchen staring
at nothing while his dinner got cold, because he was thinking about
a star.

"I saw your drawing," he said, sitting down at the dinner table.
"On the concourse."

"Did you like it?" Lily asked.

"I did. Very accurate. Good color work on Jupiter."

"Sofia's is better."

"Sofia's is more detailed. Yours has more — personality." He
paused, the way he paused when he was about to say something he'd
been thinking about. "The planet at the end. Past Pluto. The
brown one."

"Lily's Planet."

"Yes. Where did you get the idea?"

Lily shrugged. "I just drew it. It wanted to be there."

Her father looked at her for a moment. It was the look he gave the
stars through his telescope — careful, curious, as though he was
trying to see something that was just beyond the edge of visible.

"Can I look at it more closely tomorrow?" he asked. "The drawing?"

"Sure."

"And can you show me exactly where you put the planet? On the
paper, I mean. Where it is relative to the other planets?"

"It's past Pluto. In the corner."

"I know, but — how far past? Did you think about the distance?"

Lily considered this. "Kind of. I put it — it felt like it should
be about as far from Pluto as Pluto is from Neptune. But farther
out. Like, a little farther than that."

"And the color?"

"Burnt Sienna."

Her father smiled. "Burnt Sienna. Of course." He went quiet again,
doing the staring-at-nothing thing that meant he was thinking. Her
mother, who was used to this, served the dinner around him.

                               III.

On Friday morning, James Chen went to the concourse before his
shift at the observatory. He stood in front of Lily's drawing for
fifteen minutes, which was long enough for two other parents to
notice and wonder if he was all right.

He was looking at the placement. Lily had drawn her solar system
with an eight-year-old's sense of scale, which meant that Mercury
was almost as big as Jupiter and the distances between the planets
were determined more by available paper space than by orbital
mechanics. But within that framework, the placement of Lily's
Planet had a specificity that caught his attention.

The planet was positioned at approximately 80 astronomical units
from the sun — if you scaled the drawing's distances to the
known planetary positions and extrapolated. That put it well beyond
the Kuiper Belt, in the region of space that astronomers had been
scanning for decades in search of the hypothesized "Planet Nine" —
a massive body whose gravitational influence had been inferred from
the orbital patterns of distant Kuiper Belt objects but which had
never been directly observed.

The estimated position of Planet Nine, based on the latest orbital
models, was between 60 and 100 AU from the sun, with the most
probable location around 75 AU.

Lily had drawn her planet at approximately 80 AU. With a ring.
And two moons.

Chen looked at the drawing for a long time. Then he went to the
observatory.

                               * * *

The Kepler Station observatory was a quiet place — a dome of
transparent composite at the station's hub, where the spin gravity
was nearly zero and the telescope floated in its mounting like a
compass needle, pointing wherever the astronomer directed it. Chen
spent most of his shifts conducting routine survey work — cataloguing
stars, monitoring known objects, adding data to the vast and ever-
growing map of the sky.

Today, he did something different.

He entered coordinates. 80 AU from the sun, along the ecliptic,
at a right ascension and declination that corresponded — as nearly
as he could estimate from an eight-year-old's crayon drawing — to
the position of Lily's Planet.

He pointed the telescope and looked.

The exposure time was long — forty-five minutes, accumulating photons
from the faint, cold reaches of the outer solar system. The image
built slowly on his monitor, pixel by pixel, the darkness resolving
into a field of distant stars, each one a tiny point of light
against the void.

And there, near the center of the field, was a point that was not
a star.

It was faint. Very faint. A smudge of light that might have been a
cosmic ray artifact, or a lens flare, or a dead pixel on the
detector. But Chen was a careful astronomer. He ran the exposure
again. And again. And a fourth time, with a slightly different
filter.

The point was there in every exposure. It was consistent in
position. It moved — very slightly, between the first and fourth
exposures — by an amount consistent with parallax for an object
at approximately 80 AU.

Chen sat at his console and stared at the images. His hands were
shaking. His hands never shook.

He ran a spectral analysis on the point's light. The spectrum was
consistent with reflected sunlight from a rocky body with surface
material in the iron oxide range — brownish, reddish. The color
one might describe, if one were using a box of sixty-four crayons,
as Burnt Sienna.

He took off his glasses, polished them, put them back on, and
looked again.

It was still there.

He picked up the comm handset and called home.

"Mei? Can you put Lily on?"

A pause. Rustling. Then: "Hi, Daddy."

"Hi, sweetheart. I have a question about your drawing. The planet
you drew — the one past Pluto. Did you — did someone tell you
where to put it? Did you see it in a book, or on a screen, or—"

"No. I just put it where it wanted to go."

"Where it wanted to go."

"Yeah. I was drawing, and I got past Pluto, and I still had room
on the paper, and I just knew there was supposed to be another one.
So I drew it."

"You knew."

"Daddy, is something wrong?"

Chen looked at the monitor. At the faint point of light, 80
astronomical units away, that an eight-year-old girl had drawn
with a Burnt Sienna crayon.

"No, sweetheart," he said. "Nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong at
all."

                               IV.

The confirmation took three weeks. Chen submitted his observations
to the International Astronomical Union and to three independent
observatories — Mauna Kea, the European Southern Observatory, and
the Deep Space Survey Array on the lunar far side. Each one trained
its instruments on the coordinates and found the same thing: a body
approximately 0.8 Earth masses, orbiting the sun at 82.3 AU, with
a thin particulate ring and two small satellites.

It was Planet Nine. Or rather, it was the object that the
theoretical models had predicted — the large body in the outer
solar system whose gravitational influence had been shaping the
orbits of distant Kuiper Belt objects for billions of years. It
had been searched for, debated, hypothesized, modeled, and argued
about for decades. And an eight-year-old girl on a space station
had drawn it with crayons.

The news spread the way all news spreads on a space station — fast,
in every direction, and with approximately zero ability to contain
it. By dinnertime on the day the confirmation was announced, every
person on Kepler Station knew that Lily Chen had drawn a planet
that nobody had ever seen, and that the planet was real, and that
nobody could explain how she had known.

Lily, for her part, did not understand what the fuss was about.

"I just drew it," she told the reporter from the Station Gazette,
a nice woman who asked too many questions and wrote down the
answers very fast. "It wanted to be there."

"But how did you know where to put it?"

Lily thought about this. "I don't know. I was drawing, and I
got to the edge of the solar system, and there was still paper
left, and it felt like there should be more. Like the picture
wasn't done yet. So I kept going."

"And the color? The Burnt Sienna?"

"That's the color it is."

"How do you know what color it is?"

Lily gave the reporter the look that eight-year-olds give adults
when adults are being particularly dense. "Because that's the
crayon I picked up. It was the right one."

                               * * *

The art contest was judged that Friday. Sofia Gutierrez won first
place for her Jupiter, which everyone agreed was technically
superior. Lily won an Honorable Mention, which came with a
certificate and a new box of crayons.

She also received a letter from the International Astronomical
Union, informing her that the newly discovered body at 82.3 AU had
been officially designated "Planet Chen" — the first planet named
after its discoverer who was under the age of ten.

Chen argued, gently, that the designation should be "Lily's
Planet," which was what his daughter had written on her drawing.
The IAU replied that informal names were not within their
nomenclature protocols. Lily's Planet it was not.

Lily did not care about nomenclature protocols. She cared about
two things: that Mr. Whiskers was coming to live on the station
(her parents, worn down by months of polite but relentless
lobbying, had finally agreed), and that her drawing was now
displayed in the observatory, in a frame, next to the telescope
that had found her planet.

She went to see it sometimes, after school, climbing the zero-g
corridor to the hub where her father worked. She would float in
the dome, looking up through the transparent composite at the
stars — millions of them, bright and sharp and impossibly numerous
— and she would think about the planet she had drawn. Her planet.
Out there, in the dark, past Pluto, where nobody had drawn a
planet before.

She didn't know how she had known it was there. She didn't think
about it much. Knowing things was something that happened sometimes
— you looked at a blank piece of paper, and you saw what was
supposed to be on it, and you drew it. That was all. It wasn't
mysterious. It was just drawing.

But sometimes, floating in the observatory dome, looking at the
stars, she felt something — a tingle, a pull, a whisper from the
dark at the edge of everything — that said: there is more. There
is always more. The paper never runs out. The crayons never get
used up. There are always more planets, more stars, more things
to draw, more things to discover, more things that are waiting
out there in the dark for someone to pick up the right crayon and
say: you belong here.

She smiled, and floated, and the stars went on forever.

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

HAROLD "HAL" MERCER is a civil engineer and writer whose stories
have appeared in Astounding, Galaxy, and Engineering News-Record
(the latter by accident, when a technically detailed story about
orbital stress fractures was mistaken for a professional article).
Born in Akron, Ohio, and educated at Ohio State University, he
served in the Army Corps of Engineers during the war and spent
twenty years designing highway interchanges for the Ohio Department
of Transportation before his fiction career began in earnest. He
lives in Akron with his wife Dorothy, their four sons, and a
basement full of model railroads. "Great Wall of Sol" is his
most ambitious story to date, and he reports that the engineering
calculations for the Wall took longer than writing the story
itself, which he considers "exactly the right proportion."

REX DRUMMOND is a former bomber pilot, occasional rancher, and
full-time teller of tales whose action-adventure stories have
appeared in Planet Stories, Thrilling Wonder Stories, and every
issue of this magazine that will hold still long enough for him
to fill it. Born in Midland, Texas, and educated in the cockpit
of a B-17, he lives in San Diego with his current wife, his
previous wife's dog, and a cigar that appears to be permanently
attached to his person. "Breaking the Seal" represents what he
calls "a slight departure" — a story in which things are taken
apart rather than blown up, although, as readers will note, he
did manage to blow something up anyway.

AGNES WHITFIELD teaches high school English in Salina, Kansas, and
writes science fiction at her kitchen table between harvests. Her
stories have appeared in Galaxy, The Magazine of Fantasy and
Science Fiction, and The Saturday Evening Post. A graduate of the
University of Kansas, she lives on a small farm outside Salina
with her husband Lloyd and credits the Kansas landscape — "flat
as a page, wide as a possibility" — with teaching her everything
she knows about writing. "Flickering Boards" is her eighth
appearance in these pages and her most hopeful story to date,
which she attributes to "a good winter wheat crop and a general
improvement in my disposition."

THEODORE CAIN is a writer, former autoworker, and reliable
provider of stories on deadline whose fiction has appeared in
virtually every science fiction magazine currently in publication.
Born in Detroit and educated at Wayne State University, he works
as a technical writer for General Motors and writes fiction from
8:00 PM to midnight, seven days a week, in a converted bedroom
of his house in Dearborn, Michigan. He lives with his wife Jean
and their three children. "Architect's Confession" is his
thirty-fourth appearance in these pages, and he notes that the
story's theme — the question of whether perfection is desirable
— is one he has "personal opinions about, having never achieved
it."

FRANKLIN HOYT is a journalist, political commentator, and science
fiction writer whose work has appeared in Astounding, Galaxy, The
Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and The Washington Post.
Born and raised in Washington, D.C., he attended Howard University
and served in the Army during the war in a segregated unit, an
experience he describes as "the most important education I ever
received." He lives in Washington with his wife Barbara, a civil
rights attorney, and their three children. "The Wrath of the
Rational" is his seventeenth appearance in these pages and his
most personal story, which he dedicates to "my mother, who
couldn't carry a tune, and who was right about everything
important."

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a physicist and writer whose stories have
appeared in Astounding, Galaxy, Physical Review Letters (where
they are not classified as fiction, though some of his colleagues
disagree), and this magazine since its first issue. Born in
Kharkov, Ukraine, and raised in Cleveland, Ohio, he holds a
doctorate in astrophysics from MIT and maintains a research
position at Caltech, where he divides his time between theoretical
physics and speculative fiction. He describes "Stellar Crucible" as "the
story that frightened me most to write," and declines to say
whether the element described in the story is based on any
theoretical work he is currently conducting.

DANNY KOWALSKI is a middle school science teacher and writer whose
stories have appeared in Galaxy, The Magazine of Fantasy and
Science Fiction, and the mimeographed newsletter of the Pittsburgh
Science Fiction Society, which he co-founded in 1954. Born and
raised in the Polish Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh, he attended
the University of Pittsburgh on the GI Bill and has been teaching
seventh-grade science for twelve years. He lives in Pittsburgh
with his wife Mary and their four children. "Lily's Extra Planet"
was inspired, he says, by a student who drew a picture of the
solar system "that was technically wrong in every particular and
somehow more right than the textbook."

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have just finished reading "Dead Man's Beacon" by Robert Finley in
your February issue (#38) and I must tell you that the ending brought
tears to my eyes, which is not an experience I typically associate
with science fiction. The image of Corporal Hadley defending his post
against an enemy that has already surrendered, not knowing the war is
over, is one of the most poignant things I have read in any genre
this year. Mr. Finley has outdone himself. More from this quarter,
please.

Dear Max,

Dr. Tanaka's "The Resonance of Shells" in issue #37 (January 1956)
is a masterpiece of patience — both in its subject matter and in its
execution. I have never read a first contact story that moves so
slowly and so deliberately, and I mean that as the highest praise.
The scene in which Dr. Ashford realizes that the organism has been
studying her for twenty years — that it has been patient on a time
scale she cannot comprehend — is genuinely humbling. Tanaka
understands something that most SF writers do not: that the universe
is not on our schedule.

Dear Editor,

I wish to register a mild but sincere objection to Colonel Stanton's
"Holding Pattern" in issue #37. While I respect the Colonel's
military credentials and acknowledge the story's technical
authenticity, I find his portrayal of the alien fleet commander
disappointingly one-dimensional. Surely, if we are to imagine
interstellar warfare, we can imagine adversaries with motives more
complex than "destroy the humans." Even our earthly enemies are
not so simple. I trust the Colonel will take this criticism in the
spirit in which it is offered, which is one of admiration tempered
by high expectations.

                              — Professor Alice Nguyen

Dear Sterling,

With reference to the letters in your January issue debating the
plausibility of Mr. Mercer's space elevator in "The Pylon Builders"
(issue #34): I have run the tensile strength calculations on the
carbon nanotube cable he describes, and while his numbers are
optimistic, they are not absurd. The required tensile strength of
approximately 130 GPa is within the theoretical limit of perfect
carbon nanotubes, assuming zero defects in the crystalline
structure. Mr. Mercer may be correct that such a cable could be
manufactured within the century. I am less certain of his timeline
for the political cooperation required to build the thing, but
that is a different kind of engineering entirely.

                              — Dr. Hans-Joachim Weber
                                 Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research
                                 Stuttgart, Germany

We are, as always, grateful for our readers' engagement, expertise,
and willingness to argue with us and each other. Keep the letters
coming!                                                       — M.S.

                    THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

LONG TOMORROW by Leigh Brackett
(Doubleday, 1955, $2.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Miss Brackett, known to many readers for her planetary romances and
her screenwriting work, has here produced something quite different:
a post-apocalyptic novel of extraordinary restraint and power. In a
future America that has outlawed cities and technology after nuclear
war, young Len Colter discovers a hidden community of scientists
and must decide whether knowledge is worth the risk of its misuse.
The writing is lean and vivid, the moral questions are genuinely
difficult, and the vision of a society that has chosen ignorance over
danger is chillingly plausible. This is serious science fiction of
the highest order, and it deserves a wide readership. Highly
recommended.

THEY'D RATHER BE RIGHT by Mark Clifton and Frank Riley
(Gnome Press, 1955, $3.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

This novel, which won the Hugo Award last year, concerns a
supercomputer that can grant immortality by removing psychological
blocks — but only to those who abandon their preconceptions
entirely. The premise is fascinating, and there are passages of
genuine insight into the relationship between technology and human
consciousness. The execution, however, is uneven: the pacing drags
in the middle sections, and the characterization is sometimes thin.
Recommended with reservations, primarily for readers interested in
the theme of technological transcendence.

STAR GUARD by Andre Norton
(Harcourt, Brace, 1955, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Miss Norton continues her prolific and thoroughly enjoyable
exploration of galactic civilization with this tale of a young
soldier in an interstellar mercenary corps who discovers that his
alien employers have darker motives than he was led to believe.
The military adventure is brisk and exciting, the alien cultures
are imaginatively drawn, and the young protagonist's journey from
naive recruit to disillusioned veteran is handled with the sure
touch of a writer who understands that coming-of-age stories need
not be gentle. A fine entertainment and a worthy addition to
Norton's growing body of work.
