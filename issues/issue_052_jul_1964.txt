TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITORS' DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

We are builders, all of us. Even those of us who have never driven a rivet
or poured a foundation. Even those of us who have never hefted a slide rule
or run a stress calculation at four in the morning with cold coffee and warm
fear for company. We build because we cannot help it. We look at the sky and
see not void but scaffolding.

This issue is about building — the grand kind, the kind that changes the
shape of the world and leaves a mark visible from orbit. It is about bridges
and towers and machines so large that they strain the limits of not merely
engineering but of politics, economics, and the human capacity for sustained
collective effort. It is, if you like, a return to the themes that animated
this magazine's earliest days, when we published stories about men and women
who wrestled with rivets and equations and the stubborn refusal of the
physical world to cooperate with human ambition.

But we are not the same magazine we were in 1953, and neither is the world.
In those early days, we could write about great engineering projects as
though the only obstacles were technical — as though the people doing the
building were incidental to the thing being built. We know better now. The
interstate highway system is a marvel of engineering; it is also a
instrument of displacement that bulldozed through Black neighborhoods with
the precision of a surveyor's transit and the compassion of a wrecking ball.
The rockets that reach for the heavens are built by men and women who work
in conditions that would give a nineteenth-century factory inspector pause.
The great dams that tame rivers also drown valleys, and the people who lived
in those valleys are rarely consulted.

Engineering is never merely engineering. Every bridge carries traffic in
both directions — toward progress and away from something that will be lost.
The stories in this issue understand this. They are stories about people who
build magnificent things and must reckon with the cost of magnificence.

Hal Mercer returns to these pages after a three-year absence with "Bridge
to Everywhere," a story about an orbital elevator that is simultaneously the
greatest construction project in history and the greatest labor exploitation.
It is vintage Mercer — the man knows his load tolerances — but there is a
new anger in his work that we find thrilling and necessary. Cassandra Voss,
one of the most exciting new voices in the field, gives us "The
Cartographer's Confession," an intricate tale of intelligence work and
unintended consequences among the stars. Margaret Thornton offers "Pollen
Count," a characteristically elegant meditation on what happens when the
things we engineer begin engineering us. Franklin Hoyt contributes
"Blueprints for a Better Bomb," a devastating story about a weapons designer
who discovers that making nuclear war "cleaner" may make it more likely.
Dr. Vincent Koslov investigates the harmonic structure of the universe itself
in "Resonance Engine." Rex Drummond — yes, that Rex Drummond — tackles
colonialism and salvage law in deep space in "Salvage Rights," and we
promise you it is not the story you expect from him. And Douglas Pemberton
closes the issue with "Smile Under Surveillance," a deadpan masterpiece of
bureaucratic horror that had both of us laughing and then very much not
laughing.

Seven stories. Seven visions of what we build and what it costs us.

A word about the future of the magazine. We have been gratified by the
response to our new bimonthly format and our expanded page count. The letters
continue to pour in — passionate, argumentative, and occasionally
unprintable — and we could not be happier. We want stories that take
seriously both the science and the human beings who do the science. We pay
five cents a word on acceptance, and we remain open to new voices. Send us
your blueprints.

Building is an act of faith — faith that the future is worth constructing,
even when the present gives us every reason for doubt.

Yours in the scaffolding,

                         BRIDGE TO EVERYWHERE

                    by Harold "Hal" Mercer

================================================================================

                               I.

The cable was three inches in diameter, woven from carbon nanotube fibers
that could support a theoretical load of fourteen thousand metric tons per
linear meter, and it was singing.

Ray Castillo heard it through his helmet, a low, resonant hum that traveled
up through the platform grating and into the bones of his feet. The cable
ran from the anchor station in the Galápagos to the counterweight asteroid
in geosynchronous orbit, thirty-five thousand, seven hundred and eighty-six
kilometers of continuous filament, and every meter of it vibrated with the
accumulated stresses of gravity, rotation, thermal expansion, and the small,
persistent interventions of wind at the lower altitudes. The engineers called
it the Song. The workers called it something else.

Castillo stood on Platform Fourteen, which was at the forty-thousand-foot
level — twelve thousand, one hundred and ninety-two meters, if you preferred
metric, which the engineering specifications did. Below him, the Pacific
Ocean was a sheet of hammered blue-gray visible through breaks in the cloud
cover. Above him, the cable diminished to a dark thread against the
gradually darkening sky. The platform itself was a disk of reinforced
composite forty meters across, bolted to the cable housing at six points
and cantilevered outward to provide workspace for the construction crews. It
swayed. Everything swayed at this altitude. You got used to it or you didn't
last.

He had been project director of the Tethys Orbital Elevator for four years,
seven months, and eleven days. He knew this because he kept count. Not out
of sentiment — Castillo was not a sentimental man — but because precision
was a habit, and habits were what kept you sane when you were managing the
largest construction project in human history, twelve time zones from home,
with a workforce of nine thousand, a budget that had been revised upward
eleven times, and a completion deadline that moved like a mirage in the
desert: always eighteen months away, no matter how far you'd come.

The Tethys Elevator was the brainchild of the International Space
Development Authority, which was itself the brainchild of seventeen national
governments, four multinational corporations, and a treaty organization
that had been designed by committee and showed it. The concept was
straightforward: a permanent, fixed structure connecting the Earth's surface
to geosynchronous orbit, capable of lifting cargo and passengers to space
at a fraction of the cost of chemical rocketry. The engineering was
difficult but theoretically sound. The politics were neither.

Castillo had accepted the position because he believed in the elevator. He
had spent his career building things — bridges in the Andes, tunnels in the
Rockies, a deep-water port facility in Singapore that the trade journals had
called impossible until it was finished and then called inevitable — and the
elevator was the culmination of everything he understood about structural
engineering, materials science, and the organized application of human labor
to problems that seemed, from the outside, insoluble. It was the bridge to
everywhere. A single structure that would open the solar system the way the
transcontinental railroad had opened the American West, and he intended to
see it finished if it killed him.

It might, at that. He had lost seventeen workers since construction began —
four to mechanical failure, two to human error, six to decompression events
at altitude, and five to what the incident reports classified as
"environmental exposure," which was a polite way of saying the cold got
them. The suits were rated for the conditions at Platform Fourteen, but
"rated for" and "adequate for" were different things when you were working
a twelve-hour shift at forty thousand feet in an airstream that ran thirty
below zero and moved at a hundred and forty knots. The workers knew this.
The workers had been complaining about it for two years. And the workers —
as of six hours ago — had stopped working.

"Ray." The voice in his headset was Lena Oduya, his operations chief,
speaking from the command module at Platform Six, twenty-four thousand feet
below. "We've got a situation."

"I know we've got a situation, Lena. I'm standing in the middle of it."

"It's worse than you think. It's not just Fourteen. We've got work
stoppages on Platforms Twelve, Thirteen, Fifteen, and Sixteen. The lower
platforms are still running, but Twelve is talking about solidarity, and if
Twelve goes, everything below it goes too."

Castillo closed his eyes. The cable sang beneath his feet.

"Who's leading it?"

"Gorski. Who else?"

Stefan Gorski. Of course it was Gorski. The man was a welder from Gdańsk
who had come up through the Polish construction unions and who had been,
in Castillo's private estimation, the best structural worker on the project
and the most dangerous personality. Gorski was forty-six years old, built
like a bridge pier, and possessed of the calm, patient stubbornness of a
man who had learned how to organize under a government that shot organizers.
He had been filing grievances for eighteen months — suit quality, shift
length, hazard pay, medical response times, the temperature in the sleeping
modules, the caloric content of the food, the ventilation in the welding
bays. Every grievance was legitimate. Every grievance had been forwarded to
the Authority's labor relations office in Geneva, where it had been
acknowledged, logged, and buried under the procedural sediment of an
international bureaucracy that moved at the speed of continental drift.

"What are their demands?" Castillo asked.

"The usual, plus three new ones. New thermal suits rated for sixty below.
Medical evacuation guarantee — thirty minutes to a pressurized facility,
not the current ninety. And hazard pay tripled for anyone working above
Platform Ten."

"We can't triple hazard pay. Geneva would have to renegotiate every labor
contract on the project."

"I know that. Gorski knows that too. He's making a point."

"His point is going to cost us four months if we lose the weather window
for the Sixteen-to-Twenty cable splice."

"His point is that three men died on Fourteen last month because their suits
failed at altitude, and the replacement suits haven't arrived because
someone in procurement decided to save twelve percent by sourcing from a
secondary manufacturer."

Castillo said nothing. He knew about the procurement decision. He had signed
off on it. Not because he thought it was a good idea, but because the
Authority had cut his budget by nine percent in the last quarterly review,
and something had to give, and the secondary manufacturer's suits met the
published specifications — on paper, in a laboratory, at sea level. At
forty thousand feet, in actual service, they failed. Three men had died in
the space of eleven days, and Castillo had written the letters to their
families, and the letters had been, in his judgment, the most dishonest
things he had ever produced, because they spoke of unavoidable risk and the
inherent dangers of frontier construction when the truth was simpler and
uglier: someone had bought cheap suits to save money, and three men had
frozen to death because of it.

"Where is Gorski now?" he asked.

"Platform Fourteen mess hall. He's holding a meeting."

"I'm going to talk to him."

"Ray—"

"I'm going to talk to him, Lena."

                              II.

The mess hall on Platform Fourteen was a pressurized module bolted to the
underside of the platform deck, accessible through an airlock that wheezed
and clanked with the distinctive complaint of machinery that had been
serviced on schedule but not well. Inside, the air was warm and smelled of
reconstituted coffee, sweat, and the faint metallic tang of recycled
atmosphere. The walls were bare composite with condensation forming in the
corners. A row of fold-down tables ran the length of the module, and at
every table, and standing in the aisles between them, were workers.

Castillo counted eighty-three. He knew the platform's complement was
ninety-one, which meant the remaining eight were either on essential
maintenance — life support, cable monitoring, platform structural
integrity — or had decided not to attend, which would not endear them to
their colleagues and would probably ensure their attendance at the next
meeting.

Gorski stood at the far end of the module, in front of a whiteboard on
which someone had written, in block letters: SEVEN DEAD SINCE MARCH. WHAT
IS THE ACCEPTABLE NUMBER? Below it, in smaller letters: THE AUTHORITY SAYS
ZERO. THE AUTHORITY LIES.

He was a big man, Gorski — not tall, but wide, with forearms like cable
drums and a face that looked like it had been carved from the same
composite as the platform hull. He wore his work coveralls, the orange ones
that marked him as a certified high-altitude welder, and he stood with his
hands at his sides and his feet planted, the way a man stands when he
expects to be standing for a long time.

"Mr. Castillo," Gorski said. His English was heavily accented but precise.
He had learned it on the project, which meant his technical vocabulary was
better than his conversational vocabulary, a combination that gave his
speech a peculiar formal quality, as though he were narrating a specification
document. "You have come to the meeting."

"I've come to listen," Castillo said.

"Then you are the first manager to do so. Please. Sit."

There was no empty seat. A woman Castillo recognized — Kamala Prasad, a
cable rigger from Hyderabad — stood and offered hers. Castillo shook his
head.

"I'll stand," he said. "Go on."

Gorski looked at him for a long moment. Then he turned to the room.

"We have filed forty-seven grievances in eighteen months," he said. "The
official response to forty-seven grievances is forty-seven acknowledgments,
eleven promises to investigate, and zero changes. I will say that again.
Zero. No new suits. No improved medical evacuation. No reduction in shift
length. Nothing. We are told to wait. We are told the process is ongoing.
We are told that our concerns are being taken seriously."

He paused.

"Bożena Wójcik is dead. She was twenty-nine years old, from Kraków, a
first-class welder who could lay a bead straighter than any machine I have
seen. Her thermal suit failed on March the twelfth during a routine splice
operation at Platform Fourteen exterior. The suit's heating element shorted
at the left shoulder junction. She reported the malfunction at 0347 hours.
The nearest medical team was on Platform Nine. They arrived at 0519. She
was dead at 0502. Core temperature twenty-seven degrees Celsius."

The room was silent.

"Marcus Chen. Thirty-four. From Taipei. Cable technician, Grade Three. His
suit's oxygen recycler malfunctioned on March the seventeenth. He lost
consciousness at altitude and fell. We recovered his body from Platform
Eleven. The fall was two thousand meters."

Gorski's voice did not change. It maintained the same steady, factual
cadence, the cadence of a man reading a technical report, and the contrast
between the tone and the content was unbearable.

"David Anand. Twenty-six. From Mumbai. Electrician's apprentice on his
first high-altitude assignment. His suit's visor seal failed on March the
twenty-third. He was performing an inspection of the cable housing exterior.
The temperature at his location was minus forty-one Celsius. He reported
visor fogging at 1122. He reported he could not see at 1130. He did not
report again."

Gorski turned back to Castillo.

"Three dead in eleven days. Seven dead since March. Seventeen dead since
construction began. The suits are rated for the conditions. The suits fail
in the conditions. This is not a contradiction, Mr. Castillo. It is a lie.
The specifications are written for a laboratory. We do not work in a
laboratory. We work on the side of a cable in the sky, and the sky does
not care about specifications."

Castillo felt the weight of eighty-three pairs of eyes. He felt the hum
of the cable through the deck plating. He felt, with the precision of an
engineer who has spent his career calculating loads, the exact distribution
of forces acting on this moment: the workers' anger, the Authority's
budget constraints, the physics of the construction timeline, the political
pressures from seventeen governments who had promised their citizens a
space elevator and would not tolerate delay, and the simple, irreducible
fact that Gorski was right.

"I approved the procurement change," Castillo said.

The room stirred.

"I signed the order that sourced the replacement suits from Meridian
Fabrication instead of Kobayashi Heavy Industries. Meridian's suits met
spec. They were twelve percent cheaper. I knew the budget was tight and I
made a decision and three people are dead because of it."

Gorski watched him. The room was very quiet.

"I can't bring them back," Castillo said. "I can't undo the decision. What
I can do is tell you what happens next, and you can decide whether it's
enough."

"Tell us," Gorski said.

"I am going to call Geneva tonight and inform the Authority that all
construction above Platform Ten is suspended until every worker on this
project has a Kobayashi-rated thermal suit. I am going to request emergency
medical evacuation capability at Platforms Ten, Twelve, and Fourteen — full
pressurized medical modules with trained personnel, not the first-aid kits
we've been pretending are adequate. I am going to request a reduction in
maximum shift length from twelve hours to eight at all platforms above Ten."

"And hazard pay?" someone called from the back of the room.

"I'm going to recommend tripling it. I can't guarantee Geneva will agree.
I can guarantee I'll make the recommendation in writing, with my name on
it, and I'll send a copy to every labor ministry in every participating
nation."

Gorski was quiet for a long time.

"You understand," he said, "that these requests will delay the project."

"By at least six months."

"And you understand what the Authority will do when you make these
requests."

"They'll fire me," Castillo said. "Probably."

"And yet you will make them."

"Stefan, I'm an engineer. I build things. I don't build things on top of
people's bodies."

                              III.

He made the call from his quarters on Platform Fourteen — a compartment six
feet by eight feet with a fold-down bunk, a fold-down desk, and a porthole
that looked out on the darkening sky. At this altitude, you could see the
curvature of the Earth if you pressed your face to the glass and looked
down. Castillo did not look down. He looked at the communications console
and composed himself the way he composed a design specification: clearly,
precisely, and without ornament.

The Authority's director of operations was a Belgian named Willem De Groot
who had been an aerospace executive before his appointment and who managed
the elevator project the way he had managed his company: by the numbers.
De Groot was not a bad man. He was a man who believed that complex projects
could be reduced to spreadsheets, and that spreadsheets, properly managed,
would yield optimal outcomes. He was wrong, but he was wrong in a way that
was sanctioned by every business school on the planet, and correcting him
required a kind of patience that Castillo was running out of.

"Ray," De Groot said. His face on the screen was composed, his office in
Geneva visible behind him — all glass and blond wood and the kind of
designed efficiency that looked reasonable from a distance and sterile up
close. "I've been expecting your call."

"Then you know what I'm going to say."

"I know you've got a labor action. We've been monitoring. I also know
that you have a weather window closing in nineteen days for the Sixteen-
to-Twenty splice, and if you miss it, we're looking at a four-month delay
and a cost overrun that will require a supplemental authorization from the
governing board."

"I know the window, Willem. I set the window."

"Then you understand the urgency."

"I understand the urgency of keeping the people who build this thing alive.
I'm suspending construction above Platform Ten."

De Groot's expression did not change. He was a man who had learned to
receive bad news the way a seawall receives waves: by being immovable.

"On what authority?"

"On my authority as project director, under Section 14.3 of the project
charter, which grants me discretionary suspension authority in the event
of imminent hazard to personnel."

"Section 14.3 was intended for acute emergencies. Equipment failures.
Structural incidents. Not labor disputes."

"Three dead workers in eleven days is an acute emergency, Willem. The fact
that it's also a labor dispute doesn't change the physics. The suits are
failing. The medical response times are inadequate. The shift lengths are
too long for the conditions. These are engineering problems with engineering
solutions, and I am not going to resume construction until the solutions
are implemented."

"Ray, the governing board—"

"The governing board can fire me. They probably will. But they can't fire
the laws of thermodynamics, and they can't fire the fact that a human body
at forty thousand feet in a failed thermal suit reaches lethal core
temperature in under twenty minutes. These are not negotiable numbers.
These are the kind of numbers that I was hired to understand, and I am
telling you: the current conditions will kill more people. Not might.
Will."

De Groot was silent for seven seconds. Castillo counted.

"What do you need?" De Groot said.

Castillo told him. Kobayashi suits. Medical modules. Reduced shifts.
Hazard pay review. He laid it out with the same methodical clarity he
brought to a structural analysis, each requirement supported by data,
each data point traceable to a source, each source documented. He was an
engineer. He built his arguments the way he built his bridges: to bear
the load.

"This will cost forty-two million dollars above current budget," De Groot
said.

"Seventeen funerals have cost more than that, Willem. You just haven't
been counting the right currency."

De Groot looked at him through the screen. Behind him, Geneva was golden
in the late-afternoon light, its lake and its mountains and its old,
comfortable certainties about how the world worked visible through the
office windows like a painting of a place that had never had to build
anything higher than a clock tower.

"I'll take it to the board," De Groot said. "No promises."

"No promises," Castillo agreed. "But Willem — take it to them tonight.
Before the next shift starts. Before anyone else freezes."

                              IV.

He didn't sleep. He sat on his bunk with the lights dimmed and listened to
the cable sing. It was different at night — the thermal differentials
shifted as the sun moved, and the harmonics changed, and if you had been
on the project long enough, you could tell the time by the pitch. It was a
beautiful sound, if you forgot what it meant. It meant that the largest
structure ever built by human hands was flexing, breathing, adjusting itself
to the forces that acted upon it every second of every day, and that those
forces were enormous, and that the margin between structural integrity and
catastrophic failure was, at every point along the cable's length, a matter
of careful engineering.

Careful engineering. That was what he had dedicated his life to. The idea
that you could, through rigorous analysis and honest calculation, determine
the forces acting on a structure and design that structure to withstand
them. That you could account for wind load and thermal stress and material
fatigue and dead weight and live load and seismic activity and a hundred
other variables, and that if you did the math right and built to spec, the
thing would stand. The bridge would hold. The tunnel would not collapse.
The cable would not snap.

But you could not account for the variable of human indifference. You could
not design a structure that would withstand the force of a bureaucracy that
valued its budget more than its workers. You could not calculate the load
tolerance of a man's patience when his colleagues were dying and the people
in charge were sending acknowledgment letters. There was no equation for
that. Castillo had looked.

He thought about Dorothy, at home in Houston, who had married an engineer
and understood what that meant — the late nights, the long absences, the
conversations that trailed off into technical jargon — and who had
supported every project without complaint until this one. "Come home, Ray,"
she had said in their last call, a week ago. "It's not worth dying for."

"I'm not going to die," he had told her.

"The people who work for you are dying."

He had not had an answer for that. He still didn't.

He thought about Gorski, standing in the mess hall with his hands at his
sides, reading the names of the dead with the precision of a man who
understood that precision was a form of respect. Gorski had not raised his
voice. He had not threatened. He had simply stated facts, the way you state
the load tolerance of a structural member: this is what it can bear, and
this is what it cannot, and if you exceed the limit, it will fail. The
workers had exceeded their limit. The failure was not theirs.

He thought about the elevator.

It was, by any measure, the most remarkable thing human beings had ever
built. A single continuous structure stretching from the surface of the
Earth to geosynchronous orbit, thirty-five thousand kilometers of cable and
platform and habitation module and cargo lift, a thread connecting the
planet to the cosmos. When it was finished — if it was finished — it would
transform human civilization more profoundly than the railroad, the
telegraph, and the airplane combined. The cost of reaching orbit would drop
from ten thousand dollars a kilogram to fifty. The solar system would open
like a door. Humanity would cease to be a single-planet species and become
something else, something larger, something that Castillo could not quite
imagine but could feel in his bones the way he felt the cable's song
through the deck plating: a vibration, a possibility, a future.

And it was being built on the backs of people who were dying because
someone had bought cheap suits.

That was the thing about great engineering projects. The histories
remembered the engineers, the designers, the visionaries who conceived the
grand plan and drew the blueprints. They did not remember the workers who
drove the rivets and poured the concrete and died in the caissons. The
Brooklyn Bridge had killed twenty workers during its construction, and
every schoolchild knew the name of its designer, John Roebling, and
perhaps his son Washington, who took over after his father's death. Nobody
knew the names of the twenty. The Panama Canal had killed twenty-five
thousand, and the name everyone remembered was Goethals, the Army engineer
who finished the job. Nobody remembered the West Indian laborers who died
of yellow fever and malaria and landslides in the Culebra Cut.

The elevator would be the same. When it was finished, the histories would
say: the Tethys Orbital Elevator was designed by Dr. Kenji Yamamoto and
built under the direction of the International Space Development Authority.
They would not say: seventeen workers died during construction because the
thermal suits were inadequate and the medical evacuation times were too
long and the people in charge decided that the budget was more important
than the workers. That would be a footnote, if it appeared at all.

Unless someone made it more than a footnote.

Castillo sat in the dark and listened to the cable sing and thought about
what kind of engineer he wanted to be.

                              V.

The board's response came at 0614 the next morning, Geneva time, which was
0114 on Platform Fourteen. Castillo was still awake.

De Groot's face on the screen was drawn. Behind him, the Geneva office was
dark except for his desk lamp.

"The board has approved the Kobayashi suit procurement. Emergency order.
Six-week delivery."

"Six weeks is too long. People are working in the current suits now."

"I know. I've also secured an interim measure — we're pulling two hundred
surplus Kobayashi suits from the Artemis Station project. They're
compatible with your specifications. They can be on-site in seventy-two
hours."

"That's not enough for the full above-Ten complement."

"No. But it's enough for the critical-altitude crews on Thirteen through
Sixteen. The rest will have to wait for the full shipment."

"And the medical modules?"

"Approved. Three modules, Platforms Ten, Twelve, and Fourteen, fully
staffed. Eight-week installation timeline. In the interim, we're
stationing a medical helicopter at the surface facility with a thirty-
minute response ceiling to Platform Eight. Above that—" De Groot hesitated.
"Above that, we're still working on it."

"Shift reduction?"

"Approved. Eight-hour maximum above Platform Ten, effective immediately."

"Hazard pay?"

"Doubled. Not tripled. The board wouldn't go to triple. I pushed."

Castillo did the math. Doubled was not tripled. But doubled was more than
nothing, and the Kobayashi suits were coming, and the medical modules were
approved, and the shifts were being reduced, and these were real changes
that would keep real people alive, and he had to decide whether real was
good enough when he had asked for right.

"Am I still project director?" he asked.

De Groot's mouth twitched.

"The board considered removing you. I argued against it. I told them that
firing the project director in the middle of a labor action would guarantee
that the labor action succeeded completely and permanently, and that the
resulting delay would cost approximately ten times more than your safety
recommendations. They found this persuasive."

"You saved my job by telling them it would be expensive to fire me."

"I saved your job by speaking a language they understand. You're welcome."

Castillo sat with this for a moment.

"Willem," he said. "Thank you."

"Don't thank me. Fix it. You have a window closing."

                              VI.

He went back to the mess hall at 0700, when the night shift was ending and
the module was full of workers eating breakfast — reconstituted eggs,
protein bars, coffee that tasted like it had been brewed in a fuel cell.
Gorski was there, sitting at a corner table with four of his people, and he
looked up when Castillo walked in with the expression of a man who has
been expecting company.

Castillo told him what the board had offered. Gorski listened without
interruption, his thick hands wrapped around a coffee cup, his eyes on
Castillo's face. When Castillo finished, Gorski was quiet for a long time.

"Doubled," he said. "Not tripled."

"Not tripled."

"The suits are coming."

"Seventy-two hours for the interim shipment. Six weeks for the full order."

"And the shifts."

"Eight hours, effective immediately."

Gorski looked at his people. They looked back. A conversation occurred in
the language of glances and small gestures that develops among people who
work together in dangerous conditions, where a nod or a raised eyebrow
can carry the weight of a paragraph.

"It is not everything," Gorski said.

"No."

"But it is not nothing."

"No."

Gorski stood. He was exactly Castillo's height, and they looked at each
other across the narrow space between the tables, and Castillo could feel
the hum of the cable through the deck plating, and the weight of the
decision that was being made, and the knowledge that this moment — this
ordinary, unglamorous, unremarkable moment in a mess hall at forty thousand
feet — was the moment on which the project turned.

"We go back to work," Gorski said. "On two conditions."

"Name them."

"First. The names of the dead are inscribed on the completed elevator. Not
a plaque in a hallway. On the structure itself. Visible. Permanent. So
that every person who rides the elevator to the stars passes the names of
the people who built it and died building it."

Castillo felt something shift in his chest. "I can guarantee that," he
said. "That one's mine to give."

"Second. You stay. You remain project director. If they replace you with
someone who cares about the schedule more than the workers, we stop again,
and the next time, we don't start."

"I can't guarantee that one. That's the board's decision."

"Then tell the board what I have told you. We work for engineers who
understand that the cable is nothing without the hands that build it. We
do not work for accountants."

Castillo extended his hand. Gorski looked at it for a moment — the
formality seemed to amuse him — and then took it. His grip was enormous,
the grip of a man who welded steel at forty thousand feet for a living, and
it was, Castillo thought, the most honest handshake he had received in four
years on the project.

"I'll need your crews ready by 1600," Castillo said. "We have a cable
splice to prepare."

"My crews are always ready, Mr. Castillo. It is the Authority that is
not."

                              VII.

The work resumed.

Castillo stood on Platform Fourteen and watched the crews move out onto
the cable housing, their figures small against the immensity of the sky.
They wore the same inadequate suits — the Kobayashi replacements were
still seventy-two hours away — but the shifts were eight hours now, and
the medical team on Platform Nine had been reinforced, and the crews moved
with the careful, deliberate competence of people who are doing dangerous
work and know it and do it anyway because the work matters.

The cable sang.

Castillo had spent his career building things, and he had always believed
that the thing itself was what mattered — the bridge, the tunnel, the port,
the elevator. The structure. The engineered solution to the physical
problem. That was what endured. That was what the histories recorded. And
it was true, as far as it went. The Brooklyn Bridge still stood. The Panama
Canal still carried ships. The things that engineers built outlasted the
engineers and the workers and the controversies and the cost overruns and
the deaths, and there was a kind of nobility in that permanence.

But Gorski had asked him for something different. Gorski had asked him to
build the names of the dead into the structure itself. To make the elevator
not merely a monument to engineering but a monument to the people who had
done the engineering — not the project directors and the designers in their
offices in Geneva, but the welders and the cable riggers and the
electricians who had climbed into inadequate suits and gone out onto the
cable in the dark, at forty thousand feet, in thirty-below wind, and done
the work.

It would be, Castillo thought, the most important thing he ever built.

Below him, the clouds parted, and the Pacific spread out in the afternoon
light, blue and endless, and above him, the cable rose toward the stars,
and the crews were working, and the elevator was growing, and somewhere in
Geneva, accountants were revising budgets, and somewhere in Gdańsk, a
welder's family was mourning, and somewhere in the future, a child would
ride the elevator to orbit and pass a panel inscribed with the names of the
seventeen — eighteen, twenty, however many it would be before the project
was done — people who had died to build the thing that carried her, and she
would not know their stories, but she would know their names.

Castillo stood on the platform and listened to the cable sing and felt,
for the first time in four years, that he was building something worthy of
the people who were building it.

The cable hummed. The clouds shifted. The work went on.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                    THE CARTOGRAPHER'S CONFESSION

                        by Cassandra Voss

================================================================================

                              I.

The errors were deliberate, of course. Every cartographer in the Imperial
Survey Office understood this, though the understanding was never spoken
aloud, never committed to memorandum, never acknowledged in the meticulous
procedural manuals that governed the Office's operations. The errors simply
existed — a navigational hazard displaced by three-tenths of a parsec, a
jump-point frequency shifted by a harmless but meaningful fraction, a
stellar classification adjusted from G2V to G3V — and they existed for
the reason that all deliberate inaccuracies in official documents exist:
because accurate maps, in the wrong hands, are weapons.

Miriel Ashton had been correcting these errors for seven months.

She worked in a basement office in the Survey building on Tavaris Prime,
the administrative capital of the Protectorate of the Galenic Arm, in a
room that smelled of recycled air and the peculiar metallic ozone of
holographic projection equipment running at capacity. Her official title
was Senior Cartographic Analyst, Grade Three, which meant she was important
enough to have her own workstation but not important enough to have a
window. Her unofficial title, known only to the eleven people who comprised
the Steering Committee of the Liberation Compact, was rather different.

She was a spy.

The word itself was inadequate — too dramatic, too redolent of cloaks and
ciphers and the clumsy theatrics of popular fiction. What Miriel did was
quiet, painstaking, and exquisitely dull: she identified the deliberate
errors in the Protectorate's official star charts and transmitted the
corrections, through a chain of intermediaries so convoluted that she
herself could not have traced it to its end, to the worlds of the Galenic
Free Corridor, where the Liberation Compact was assembling the resources
for what its leaders called "the Restoration" and what the Protectorate's
intelligence services called, when they spoke of it at all, "the
insurgency problem."

The Free Corridor comprised thirty-seven worlds on the coreward fringe of
the Galenic Arm, worlds that had been self-governing before the
Protectorate's expansion and that chafed under the administrative apparatus
that now managed their trade routes, taxed their commerce, and garrisoned
their orbital stations with Protectorate warships. The Compact's stated aim
was the restoration of self-governance to the Corridor worlds. Its methods,
thus far, had been political: petitions, diplomatic appeals to the
Interstellar Court, economic pressure through coordinated trade
disruptions. But the Compact's strategists understood what Miriel
understood: that politics without the credible threat of force was
merely begging.

The star charts were the key. The Protectorate's control of the Galenic Arm
rested on three pillars: military superiority, economic integration, and
navigational monopoly. The first two were formidable but not absolute. The
third was nearly so. The Protectorate maintained the only comprehensive
survey of the Arm's navigational hazards — the gravity wells, the unstable
jump-points, the radiation zones, the dark-matter shoals that could strip a
ship's shielding in minutes. Without accurate charts, independent
navigation was suicide. The Corridor worlds were dependent on Protectorate-
charted trade routes, and that dependency was, in the Compact's analysis,
the chain that bound them more securely than any garrison.

Miriel's work broke that chain. Each corrected chart she transmitted gave
the Free Corridor worlds the ability to navigate the Arm independently —
to chart their own trade routes, to move ships through jump-points the
Protectorate believed were unusable, to access resource-rich systems that
the Protectorate's doctored charts had placed behind walls of spurious
hazard data. It was, she believed, an act of liberation: the gift of
accurate knowledge to people who had been deliberately kept in ignorance.

She believed this with the calm, reasoned conviction of a woman who had
spent her career in the service of an empire and who had come, gradually
and then suddenly, to understand what that service meant.

                              II.

The understanding had arrived in stages, each one a small, precise
recalibration of the moral framework through which Miriel Ashton navigated
her life.

She had joined the Survey Office at twenty-three, fresh from the
Cartographic Institute on Tavaris, where she had graduated first in her
class with a specialization in gravitational topology. She was, by training
and temperament, a person who valued accuracy above all else. A star chart
was either correct or it was not. A jump-point frequency either matched the
empirical data or it did not. The universe did not care about politics or
ideology or the administrative convenience of empires; it presented its
geography with brutal objectivity, and the cartographer's duty was to
record that geography with equal objectivity. This was what Miriel
believed, and it was what she was good at, and for the first eleven years
of her career, it was enough.

The first stage of her recalibration came when she was thirty-four, during
a routine audit of the charts for the Velden Reach, a cluster of systems
on the Corridor's trailing edge. She had noticed a discrepancy — a
navigational hazard, a gravity anomaly associated with an unstable binary
system, that appeared in the official charts at coordinates that did not
match the raw survey data. The anomaly was real, but its position had been
shifted. Not by much. Three-tenths of a parsec — a trivial distance in
astronomical terms, but a lethal one for any ship that relied on the chart
to navigate the region. A ship following the official chart would avoid the
displaced hazard and fly directly into the real one.

She had reported the discrepancy to her section chief, a thin, precise man
named Wren who had been with the Survey Office for thirty years and who
received her report with the particular stillness of a person who is
deciding how much truth to dispense.

"The charts are correct," Wren said.

"With respect, sir, they are not. The survey data from the Velden
automated probe clearly—"

"The charts," Wren repeated, "are correct. The survey data has been
reviewed and the chart reflects the Office's best assessment of the hazard
location."

Miriel had looked at him — at the careful blankness of his expression, the
way his hands lay flat on his desk, the minute tension in the muscles
around his eyes — and she had understood, with the sudden clarity of a
chart error snapping into focus, that Wren knew. That the displacement was
deliberate. That the Survey Office, the institution to which she had
dedicated her professional life, was systematically producing inaccurate
charts, and that the inaccuracies were not errors but policy.

She said nothing. She returned to her workstation. She began, quietly and
methodically, to catalogue the discrepancies.

There were hundreds.

The second stage of her recalibration came six months later, when a
Corridor freight vessel, the Harvest Moon, was lost with all hands in the
Velden Reach. The official report attributed the loss to "navigation error
in a hazardous region." Miriel knew — with the cold, geometric certainty
of a woman who had mapped the exact discrepancy between the official chart
and the actual hazard — that the Harvest Moon had not made a navigation
error. The Harvest Moon had followed the official chart precisely. The
chart had led it into a gravity anomaly that the chart said was not there.

Forty-three crew members. A cargo of agricultural equipment bound for a
Corridor farming world that could not produce enough food to feed its
population under the Protectorate's trade restrictions.

Miriel attended the memorial service, which was held in the Survey Office's
austere chapel — a room of gray stone and filtered light where the Office
acknowledged its dead with the same formal precision it brought to
everything else. She stood in the back row and listened to the chaplain
speak of sacrifice and the hazards of space and the courage of those who
navigated the unknown, and she thought: We killed them. We killed them with
a three-tenths-of-a-parsec lie.

The third stage came when she was approached by the Compact.

                              III.

The approach was, as she would later appreciate, a masterpiece of
intelligence tradecraft — patient, indirect, and structured to give her
every opportunity to decline without consequence.

It began with a colleague named Saren Hale, a fellow cartographer whom
Miriel had known casually for years and whom she trusted in the limited,
professional way that people trust competent coworkers. Hale invited her to
dinner. Over the course of several months, the dinners became regular, and
the conversation, by increments so gradual that Miriel could not afterward
identify the precise moment of transition, shifted from professional
matters to political ones.

Hale was, it emerged, skeptical of the Protectorate — not violently, not
theatrically, but with the quiet, informed skepticism of a person who had
access to the same data Miriel had access to and who had drawn the same
conclusions. He spoke of the chart discrepancies as a systemic problem, not
a series of isolated errors. He spoke of the Corridor worlds' dependency on
Protectorate navigation as a form of control. He did not use the word
"oppression," which would have been too strong for the careful, analytical
register in which they both operated. He used the word "asymmetry," which
was more precise and, to a cartographer, more damning.

Four months after the first dinner, Hale introduced her to a woman who
identified herself only as Kael. Kael was small, dark-haired, and
possessed of a diplomat's capacity for saying exactly enough and no more.
She did not ask Miriel to spy for the Liberation Compact. She did not use
the word "spy." She asked Miriel a single question: If the Corridor worlds
had accurate charts, what would change?

And Miriel, who had spent two years cataloguing discrepancies and counting
the dead, gave the answer that Kael had come to hear: Everything.

                              IV.

The mechanics of the transmission were elegant in their simplicity. Miriel
identified the errors. She produced corrected chart segments — never
complete charts, which would be too conspicuous, but fragments, each one
covering a specific region, each one resolving a specific discrepancy. She
embedded the corrections in the metadata of routine interdepartmental
communications — budget projections, personnel reports, equipment
requisitions — using a steganographic protocol that Kael had provided and
that Miriel, with the meticulous curiosity of a trained analyst, had
verified was undetectable by the Survey Office's standard security sweeps.

The communications went to a contact in the Trade Ministry, who forwarded
them, through channels Miriel did not know and did not ask about, to the
Free Corridor.

It was, Miriel told herself, a righteous act. She was restoring accuracy to
documents that had been deliberately falsified. She was giving navigational
knowledge to people who had a right to it — the right of self-preservation,
the right to move through their own region of space without depending on
an empire that had demonstrably used its navigational monopoly as an
instrument of control and, in at least forty-three documented cases, as an
instrument of death. She was not committing treason; she was committing
cartography. She was doing what the Survey Office was supposed to do and
had ceased to do: she was making accurate maps.

She told herself this for seven months. She told it to the gray walls of
her basement office and to the holographic projections that floated in the
air before her like ghostly constellations, and she believed it, because
it was true, and because the truth of it was sufficient to sustain the
enormous weight of what she was risking — her career, her freedom, her
life, should the Protectorate's intelligence services discover what she
was doing.

Then the Tessarine Fleet came through the Velden Reach, and the truth was
no longer sufficient.

                              V.

The Tessarine Hegemony occupied the region of space coreward of the Galenic
Arm, separated from the Protectorate's territory by the Corridor worlds
and, more relevantly, by the navigational hazards that made the Arm's
coreward approaches treacherous to anyone without accurate charts.

The Tessarine were expansionists. This was understood, in the diplomatic
shorthand of the region, the way one understands that a particular neighbor
keeps enlarging his fence: with a mixture of annoyance, wariness, and the
dim awareness that a conversation about boundaries is overdue. The Tessarine
had absorbed six independent systems in the past decade, each absorption
preceded by a period of economic pressure, followed by a "security
partnership" that involved the stationing of Tessarine warships in the
system's orbital space, and concluding with a "voluntary integration" that
was voluntary in the same way that a man hands over his wallet to an armed
robber: technically, the choice exists.

The Tessarine had been unable to expand into the Galenic Arm because the
Arm's navigational hazards made military transit impractical. A fleet of
warships could not navigate the Reach without accurate charts, and the
Protectorate's charts were classified, and the Protectorate's navigational
monopoly served, whatever its other purposes, as an effective barrier to
Tessarine aggression.

Until Miriel corrected the charts.

She learned what had happened the way most people learn of catastrophe: in
fragments, each fragment more complete and more terrible than the last.

The first fragment was a news bulletin, delivered to her workstation's
general feed: "TESSARINE FLEET TRANSIT REPORTED IN VELDEN REACH. DETAILS
DEVELOPING."

The second was a classified intelligence summary, circulated to Survey
Office personnel with appropriate clearance: A Tessarine battle group
comprising fourteen warships, six troop transports, and an undetermined
number of support vessels had transited the Velden Reach through a
navigational corridor that the Protectorate's charts indicated was
impassable.

The corridor was not impassable. It was one of the corridors that Miriel
had corrected.

The third fragment was a diplomatic communique, leaked to the press and
reprinted in every news feed in the Arm: The Tessarine Hegemony announced
a "protective intervention" in the Free Corridor, citing "instability" in
the region and "threats to Tessarine commercial interests." Three Corridor
worlds — Velden, Ashmark, and Pelion — had been "invited" to accept
Tessarine security partnerships.

Miriel sat in her basement office and stared at the holographic projection
of the Velden Reach and understood, with the absolute, devastating clarity
of a person who has spent her life reading maps and who now saw the map of
her own actions for the first time, what she had done.

She had given the corrections to the Compact. The Compact had used them to
chart independent navigation routes. And someone — in the Compact, or
connected to the Compact, or who had intercepted the Compact's
communications — had given those same corrections to the Tessarine.

She had broken the Protectorate's navigational monopoly. She had done it
to liberate the Corridor worlds. And the Corridor worlds were now being
occupied by a different empire.

                              VI.

Kael came to her apartment three days later. It was the first time the
woman had visited Miriel's home, and the fact of the visit — its deviation
from established protocol — told Miriel everything she needed to know
before Kael said a word.

They sat in Miriel's kitchen, a small, orderly room with a window that
overlooked the Survey Quarter's central garden, and Kael told her what
had happened in the measured, precise language of a person delivering an
intelligence briefing to someone who is, simultaneously, the audience and
the subject.

The Compact's communications had not been intercepted. The breach was
internal. A member of the Compact's Steering Committee — Kael would not say
which member — had concluded, independently and without authorization, that
the Compact could not achieve its aims through political means alone, and
that the only force capable of breaking the Protectorate's hold on the
Corridor was the Tessarine Hegemony. This member had initiated a back-
channel contact with Tessarine intelligence and had provided, as an earnest
of good faith, the corrected chart data that Miriel had transmitted.

The Tessarine had received the data. They had verified it. And they had
done exactly what empires do when they discover that a barrier to their
expansion has been removed: they had expanded.

"How many worlds?" Miriel asked.

"Three, so far. Velden, Ashmark, Pelion. The Tessarine fleet is positioned
to move on four more within the week."

"Resistance?"

"The Corridor worlds have no military capacity. That was the Protectorate's
design — keep them dependent, keep them disarmed. The Compact's political
infrastructure is intact but irrelevant. You cannot petition an occupying
fleet."

Miriel looked at the window. The garden was in bloom — engineered flora,
the Survey Quarter's contribution to Tavaris Prime's aesthetic program,
each plant calibrated for optimal visual impact and minimal maintenance.
It was beautiful and it was false, and she had spent her career surrounded
by beautiful falsehoods and had believed that the remedy for falsehood was
truth.

"The corrections I transmitted," she said. "How many of them were used for
the transit routes?"

"All of them. Every correction you provided for the Velden Reach, the
Ashmark Passage, and the Pelion Approach was incorporated into the
Tessarine fleet's navigation package."

"Then I did this."

Kael's expression shifted — the first visible emotion Miriel had seen from
her, a flicker of something that might have been compassion or might have
been the professional regret of an intelligence officer watching an asset
reach the end of her useful life.

"You provided accurate information to people who told you they would use
it for liberation. One of those people lied. The responsibility is—"

"Don't." Miriel's voice was quiet but the word carried the weight of seven
months of careful, meticulous work, seven months of believing that accuracy
was a moral act, seven months of correcting lies and discovering, at the
end, that the corrections had been incorporated into a larger lie. "Don't
tell me about the distribution of responsibility. I am a cartographer. I
understand how one error propagates through a system. The original error
was mine. I assumed that accurate maps, in the hands of people seeking
justice, would produce justice. I assumed that truth, released into a
political system, would behave like truth. It did not. It behaved like
information. Information is a tool. Tools do not care about the intentions
of their makers."

Kael was silent.

"What happens now?" Miriel asked.

"To the Corridor? The Protectorate will respond to the Tessarine
incursion. Not because the Protectorate cares about the Corridor worlds,
but because it cannot tolerate a rival power occupying territory it
considers its own. There will be a confrontation. Possibly a war."

"And to me?"

"That depends on what you do next."

"I have corrected charts for twelve more regions. Regions that the
Tessarine do not yet have access to. Regions that, if corrected, would
give the Tessarine fleet access to the entire Corridor."

"Yes."

"The Compact still wants them."

"The Compact is divided. Some members believe the Tessarine presence, while
undesirable, is preferable to the Protectorate's. Others believe—"

"It doesn't matter what they believe. The question is whether I transmit."

Kael looked at her.

"The Compact is not asking you to transmit."

"But the Compact is not telling me to stop."

Kael said nothing, which was, as Miriel had learned over seven months of
clandestine communication, the most eloquent thing the woman could say.

                              VII.

Miriel spent the night at her workstation.

The holographic projections floated before her — the Galenic Arm rendered
in light, its stars and systems and navigational hazards suspended in the
air like a map of everything she had believed and everything she had
learned. She could see the Velden Reach, with its corrected hazard
positions, the corridors she had opened now glowing with the transit tracks
of Tessarine warships. She could see Ashmark and Pelion, worlds she had
never visited but whose navigational profiles she knew with the intimate
familiarity of a person who had spent months ensuring their accuracy. She
could see the twelve uncorrected regions, their deliberate errors still in
place, the Protectorate's lies still functioning as barriers, still
protecting — through falsehood — worlds that her truth had failed to
protect.

She was, she understood, standing at the intersection of two moral
principles that she had believed were identical and that turned out to be
distinct.

The first principle was that accuracy was a moral good. That lies in
official documents were instruments of control, and that correcting those
lies was an act of liberation. This was the principle that had guided her
work for the Compact, and she still believed it. The Protectorate's charts
were lies. The lies served the Protectorate's interests. The people who
depended on those charts were being manipulated, controlled, and — in the
case of the Harvest Moon and its forty-three crew members — killed.
Correcting the lies was right.

The second principle was that the consequences of an action determined its
moral worth. That a righteous intention did not guarantee a righteous
outcome. That truth, released into a system governed by power rather than
justice, would be captured by power and used for power's purposes. This was
the principle she had learned in the past three days, and she believed it
too.

The principles were incompatible. To act on the first was to risk the
second. To act on the second was to abandon the first. There was no chart
that resolved the contradiction, no navigational solution that plotted a
course between them. She was lost, and she had lost herself by doing what
she did best: providing accurate information.

She thought about the Harvest Moon. Forty-three dead because the charts
lied.

She thought about Velden, Ashmark, Pelion. Unknown thousands facing
Tessarine occupation because the charts told the truth.

She thought about the twelve uncorrected regions, and the choice that was
not a choice: transmit the corrections and risk another Tessarine
expansion, or withhold them and preserve the Protectorate's navigational
control — the same control she had spent seven months working to dismantle.

In the end, she did neither.

                              VIII.

The confession was addressed to three parties simultaneously: the
Protectorate's Survey Office, the Liberation Compact's Steering Committee,
and the Tessarine Hegemony's diplomatic mission on Tavaris Prime. Miriel
composed it at her workstation, in the same precise, analytical prose she
used for cartographic reports, and she transmitted it through unencrypted
channels, ensuring that all three recipients would receive it at
approximately the same time and that none could suppress it without the
others' knowledge.

The document was seventeen pages long. It detailed every deliberate error
Miriel had identified in the Protectorate's official charts. It detailed
every correction she had transmitted to the Compact. It detailed the route
by which those corrections had reached the Tessarine. And it included, as
appendices, the corrected chart data for all twelve uncorrected regions —
not transmitted covertly to one party, but published openly to all of them.

The cover letter was brief:

   To the Survey Office: Your charts are lies. Here is the proof.

   To the Liberation Compact: Your cause was just and your methods
   were compromised. Here is the evidence.

   To the Tessarine Hegemony: Your invasion routes are now known to
   the Protectorate. Your tactical advantage is eliminated. Here is
   the data.

   I provide these corrections to all parties simultaneously because
   I have learned that accurate information, given to one party in
   secret, is not truth — it is advantage. Truth exists only when all
   parties have access to the same map.

   I do not expect this act to produce justice. I expect it to produce
   consequences. But the consequences will at least begin from a
   position of shared knowledge rather than asymmetric deception.

   My name is Miriel Ashton. I was a cartographer. I tried to correct
   the maps, and I learned that maps do not correct themselves. People
   correct maps, and people are not cartographers. They are empires,
   and rebels, and opportunists, and they will use any map — true or
   false — for their own purposes.

   I have no more corrections to offer. The maps are as accurate as
   I can make them. What you do with them is no longer a cartographic
   question.

She transmitted the document at 0300 hours, when the Survey Quarter was
quiet and the garden outside her window was dark. Then she powered down her
workstation, removed her identification badge, and placed it on her desk
beside the holographic projector.

She walked out of the Survey building and into the garden, where the
engineered flowers were closed for the night and the air smelled of nothing
at all, and she stood there for a long time, looking up at the sky, where
the stars were in their actual positions, where they had always been, where
no cartographer's error or correction could move them.

The stars did not care about her confession. They did not care about the
Protectorate or the Compact or the Tessarine Hegemony. They were where
they were, and the space between them was what it was, and the hazards
were real and the distances were real and the light was old, and Miriel
Ashton, who had dedicated her life to recording these facts and who had
learned that facts, once released into the world, became something other
than facts — became weapons, became leverage, became the raw material of
other people's strategies — stood in the garden and breathed the neutral
air and waited for the consequences to arrive.

They would arrive. That was the one thing the map did not lie about.

                          POLLEN COUNT

                      by Margaret Thornton

================================================================================

                              I.

The pollen was golden, fine-grained, and ubiquitous, and it had been
falling for three years.

Dr. Elise Renard noticed it on her first morning on Demeter Colony, when
she opened the door of her assigned quarters in the research compound and
found a thin, luminous film coating the walkway, the railings, the broad
leaves of the ornamental hawthorn that the colony's landscape architects
had planted along the residential corridors. She touched it with her
fingertip. It was soft, slightly adhesive, and smelled faintly of warm
honey — though this, she would later understand, was not a smell in the
conventional sense but a neurochemical response triggered by the pollen's
interaction with the olfactory receptors of the human nose.

Everything about the pollen on Demeter was more complicated than it
appeared.

Demeter was the fourth successful terraforming project of the Colonial
Development Authority — a small, rocky world orbiting a K-type star in the
Gliese 667 system, its atmosphere painstakingly reconstructed over forty
years by a sequence of engineered organisms: first the lithotrophs that
processed the regolith and released oxygen, then the cyanobacterial mats
that built the nitrogen cycle, then the mosses and lichens and grasses that
stabilized the soil, and finally the engineered trees. The trees were the
crown of the project — twenty-seven species designed by the Authority's
Botanical Engineering Division, each one calibrated to thrive in Demeter's
specific conditions of light, temperature, soil chemistry, and atmospheric
composition. They were magnificent organisms: tall, broad-canopied,
deep-rooted, their leaves engineered for optimal photosynthetic efficiency,
their root systems designed to interact with the introduced mycorrhizal
networks that threaded the colony's soil like a subterranean nervous system.

The pollen was a side effect. Or, more precisely, the pollen was a
reproductive mechanism that the Botanical Engineering Division had included
in its designs because trees, being organisms, needed to reproduce, and
reproduction in flowering plants required the dispersal of genetic material
through the medium of pollen. The Division had designed the pollen for
maximum dispersal efficiency — light, wind-borne, capable of traveling
long distances in Demeter's gentle atmospheric currents — and it worked
exactly as designed. The pollen traveled. It landed. It coated every
surface with its golden film. It entered every building through every
ventilation system. It was, by the Division's calculations, present in
every cubic meter of atmosphere within the colony's inhabited zone.

And it was changing the colonists.

This was what Elise Renard had been sent to investigate. She was a
xenobotanist — though the prefix "xeno" was contested in this case, since
the plants in question were not alien but engineered, designed in
laboratories on Earth and grown in nurseries on the Authority's orbital
station before being transplanted to Demeter's prepared soil. She held a
doctorate from the University of Washington in plant biochemistry, with a
specialization in the secondary metabolites produced by engineered
organisms — the chemical compounds that plants produced not for their
primary metabolic functions but for their interactions with other organisms:
the alkaloids that deterred herbivores, the volatile compounds that
attracted pollinators, the allelopathic chemicals that suppressed competing
plants. These compounds were, in Elise's professional opinion, the most
interesting things that plants did, because they were the medium through
which plants communicated with — and manipulated — their environment.

The Authority had sent her because the colonists on Demeter were becoming
strange.

                              II.

The strangeness was subtle, which was what made it disturbing.

Colony Director Hasan Malik met her at the landing field, a broad, level
expanse of packed soil bordered by a windbreak of engineered cypresses
whose dark foliage was dusted with the ubiquitous golden pollen. Malik was
a tall, lean man in his fifties with the careful bearing of a career
administrator, and he greeted Elise with a warmth that felt genuine and a
calm that felt, she thought, slightly excessive.

"Dr. Renard. Welcome to Demeter. I hope the transit was comfortable."

"It was fine. Director Malik, I'd like to begin my assessment as soon as
possible. The Authority's briefing mentioned behavioral changes in the
colonial population—"

"Behavioral changes." Malik smiled. It was a gentle, unhurried smile. "I
suppose that's one way to describe it. Walk with me."

They walked along the colony's main avenue, a broad path that ran from the
landing field to the central administrative complex, shaded by rows of
engineered oaks whose canopies interlocked overhead in a continuous vault
of green. The pollen drifted in the air, golden motes catching the light
of Demeter's orange-tinted sun, and the air smelled of honey and growing
things and the particular mineral clarity of a world whose atmosphere was
still young.

"The population of Demeter Colony is four thousand, eight hundred and
twelve," Malik said. "Drawn from thirty-one nationalities, average age
thirty-seven, average tenure on-world three years and four months. In the
past two years, the following has occurred. Crime rate: dropped to
effectively zero. Not low — zero. No assaults, no thefts, no vandalism,
no domestic incidents. Workplace disputes: declined ninety-seven percent.
Productivity: stable, but the character of productivity has changed. People
work steadily but without urgency. Deadlines are met, but no one seems
concerned about exceeding them. Innovation proposals: declined sixty
percent. People are content with existing systems. They maintain, they
don't improve."

Elise was taking notes on her pad. "Reproductive rates?"

"Declining. Not precipitously, but consistently. Birth rate has dropped
eighteen percent in two years. It's not that people are choosing not to
have children — contraceptive usage hasn't changed. They simply seem less
interested. Less driven."

"Conflict between community groups?"

"Effectively nonexistent. We have thirty-one nationalities here, Dr.
Renard. Thirty-one cultural traditions, thirty-one sets of historical
grievances. In the colony's first year, we had the normal frictions —
nothing serious, but the usual complaints about food, cultural respect,
resource allocation. That's gone. Not resolved — gone. People don't argue
anymore. They accommodate. They adapt. They let things go."

They had reached the central garden, a circular space at the heart of the
administrative complex where the colony's most mature trees grew — great,
broad-trunked organisms with canopies that spread thirty meters in every
direction. The garden was full of colonists sitting on benches, walking the
paths, reading, talking quietly. Elise watched them. They moved slowly.
They spoke softly. They smiled easily and often. They looked, she thought,
profoundly content.

"It sounds," she said carefully, "like a well-functioning community."

Malik stopped walking. He looked at her with an expression that combined
patience and something she could not immediately identify — something that
might have been recognition, as if he had expected her to say exactly that.

"It does, doesn't it?" he said. "That's the problem."

                              III.

Elise set up her laboratory in the colony's research wing, a clean,
well-equipped facility that smelled, like everything else on Demeter, of
golden pollen. She sealed the lab's ventilation system as best she could,
installing charcoal filters on every intake, and within twelve hours she
had accumulated enough pollen samples to begin analysis.

The pollen grains were spherical, approximately twenty-five micrometers in
diameter, with a smooth exine wall perforated by numerous pores. Under the
electron microscope, the surface texture was unremarkable — similar to
terrestrial wind-pollinated species. But the chemical analysis told a
different story.

The pollen contained, in addition to the expected proteins and lipids, a
complex of secondary metabolites that Elise had never encountered in any
engineered or natural plant. She catalogued them over the course of a week:
a family of alkaloids structurally similar to the indole compounds found
in certain terrestrial psychoactive plants, but with modifications — methyl
groups in unexpected positions, ring structures that altered the molecules'
binding affinity for specific neuroreceptors — that suggested either an
extraordinary convergent evolution or, more troublingly, a design.

The alkaloids were, she determined, neuroactive. They crossed the blood-
brain barrier efficiently, facilitated by the pollen's lipid coating, and
they interacted with the serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways of the
human brain in a manner that was subtle, persistent, and cumulative. In
low concentrations — the concentrations typical of short-term exposure —
the effects would be negligible. In the concentrations achieved by three
years of continuous inhalation, the effects would be substantial.

Increased serotonin activity. Decreased dopaminergic drive. Reduced
cortisol response. In plain language: the colonists were calmer, more
content, less anxious, less ambitious, less aggressive, and less
motivated to change their circumstances.

The pollen was, in effect, a psychoactive compound delivered through
atmospheric dispersal. The colonists were being medicated by the air they
breathed. And the plants that produced the pollen had been engineered by
the Colonial Development Authority's Botanical Engineering Division.

Elise sat in her sealed laboratory and stared at the chromatography data
and asked herself the question that any competent scientist asks when the
data is alarming: Is this intentional?

                              IV.

She found the answer in the engineering specifications.

The Botanical Engineering Division's files were accessible through the
colony's scientific database — not classified, merely tedious, buried
under layers of technical documentation that few people outside the
Division would have reason to read. Elise read them. She read the design
specifications for all twenty-seven tree species, the metabolic pathway
diagrams, the genetic modification records, the ecological interaction
models. She read the Division's internal correspondence, which was
archived in the database's administrative annex. She read for four days.

The alkaloids were not in the original design specifications.

The trees had been engineered with standard reproductive chemistry — pollen
grains containing the expected proteins and lipids, nothing more. The
neuroactive alkaloids did not appear in any design document, any genetic
modification record, any specification sheet. They were not the product
of the Division's engineering. They were the product of the trees
themselves.

The trees had evolved them.

This was, on reflection, not surprising. The trees were organisms. They had
been designed with engineered genomes, but those genomes were still genomes
— complex, dynamic, subject to mutation, recombination, and natural
selection. The Division had designed the trees for Demeter's conditions,
but Demeter's conditions included, from the trees' perspective, one factor
that the Division had not adequately accounted for: the colonists.

The colonists cut down trees. They cleared land for agriculture, for
building, for the expansion of the colony's infrastructure. They pruned.
They harvested. They modified. They imposed their will on the botanical
environment with the confidence of a species that had spent ten thousand
years bending plants to its purposes.

And the plants, operating on the timescale of evolutionary pressure
rather than individual intention, had responded. Not consciously — plants
did not have consciousness, or at least no consciousness that any
current scientific framework could recognize. But organisms under selective
pressure did not need consciousness to adapt. They needed only the
molecular machinery of mutation and selection, operating across generations,
producing variant after variant until one variant conferred an advantage.

The advantage, in this case, was a pollen that made the colonists less
inclined to cut down trees.

The alkaloids reduced aggression, ambition, and the drive to modify one's
environment. The colonists who breathed the pollen were calmer, more
content, less interested in expansion, less motivated to clear new land.
They maintained what existed. They did not improve, did not expand, did not
cut. The trees that produced the most effective alkaloids reproduced more
successfully, because the colonists around them cleared less land, which
meant more space for seedlings, which meant more trees producing more
effective alkaloids, which meant calmer colonists, which meant less
clearing—

A feedback loop. An ecological feedback loop operating across the boundary
between two kingdoms of life. The plants were domesticating their
domesticators.

                              V.

Elise presented her findings to Director Malik in his office, a large room
with windows that overlooked the central garden. The windows were open. The
air smelled of honey.

Malik listened without interruption. He was very still. When she finished,
he was quiet for a long time.

"How certain are you?" he asked.

"The chemistry is unambiguous. The alkaloids are present, they are
neuroactive, and they are not part of the original engineering
specifications. The evolutionary mechanism is consistent with established
principles of plant secondary metabolite development under selective
pressure. The behavioral changes in the colonial population correlate with
the expected neurochemical effects of chronic exposure."

"So the trees are — what? Drugging us?"

"The trees are producing a compound that modifies the behavior of the
organisms that pose the greatest threat to their survival. This is not
unusual in terrestrial botany. Tobacco produces nicotine to deter
herbivores. Certain orchids produce compounds that mimic insect pheromones
to attract pollinators. The mechanism is the same. The scale and the target
species are different."

"The target species is us."

"Yes."

Malik turned to the window. The central garden was visible below — the
great trees, the paths, the benches, the colonists moving slowly through
the afternoon light with their easy smiles and their profound, untroubled
contentment.

"Dr. Renard," he said. "I have a question for you, and I want you to
consider it carefully before you answer."

"Go ahead."

"Is what the trees are doing wrong?"

Elise opened her mouth and then closed it. It was not the question she
had expected.

"The colonists are healthy," Malik continued. "They are content. They are
at peace with each other and with their environment. Crime is zero.
Conflict is zero. They are productive, stable, and — by any reasonable
metric — happy. They are perhaps less ambitious than they were, less driven,
less innovative. But they are also less violent, less anxious, less prone
to the self-destructive behaviors that plague every other colonial
settlement I've administered. They don't drink to excess. They don't fight.
They don't abuse their partners or neglect their children. They take care
of each other and they take care of the land."

"They take care of the land because the pollen is suppressing the
neurological drives that would lead them to exploit it."

"Yes. And the result is a sustainable relationship between a human
population and a planetary ecology. The first sustainable human-environment
relationship in the history of colonization. Isn't that what we're supposed
to be building?"

Elise stared at him. "You knew."

Malik turned from the window. His expression was calm — the same excessive
calm she had noticed on her first day, and she understood now that the calm
was not personality. It was chemistry.

"I have suspected for approximately a year. I did not have the biochemical
evidence — I'm an administrator, not a scientist. But I observed the
changes in myself. I noticed that I was less concerned about the colony's
productivity metrics, less anxious about the Authority's quarterly reviews,
less driven to expand the settlement's footprint. I noticed that I was
happier. And I asked myself whether happiness, in a colony administrator,
was a symptom or a goal."

"You didn't report it."

"What would I report? That my colonists are peaceful and content? That our
crime rate is zero? That we have achieved a stable equilibrium with our
environment? The Authority would congratulate me, Dr. Renard. They would
hold us up as a model."

"They would evacuate the colony if they knew the population was being
neurochemically modified by an engineered organism."

"Would they? Or would they study us? Would they analyze the compounds and
patent them and add them to the engineering specifications for the next
thirty terraformed worlds? Would they say: Look, we have solved the
problem of colonial violence, colonial overconsumption, colonial ecological
destruction — we have solved it with a pollen grain?"

Elise was silent. She could feel the honey-scented air on her skin, could
feel the pollen in her lungs, could feel — or imagined she could feel —
the slow, gentle pressure of alkaloids against the walls of her own
neurochemistry. She had been on Demeter for twelve days. Chronic exposure
effects required months, but she was a scientist, and she could not be
certain that her own judgment was unaffected.

"I need to think about this," she said.

"Take your time," Malik said. He smiled the gentle, unhurried smile. "We
have plenty of it."

                              VI.

She thought about it in her sealed laboratory, breathing filtered air,
surrounded by chromatography readouts and pollen samples and the cool,
impersonal clarity of data.

The question was not whether the pollen was modifying the colonists'
behavior. The data was unambiguous on that point. The question was what to
do about it, and the answer depended on a prior question that the data
could not resolve: Was the modification harmful?

The conventional answer was yes. Any involuntary neurochemical modification
of a human population was, by definition, harmful, because it violated
the principle of informed consent. The colonists had not chosen to be
medicated. They had not been told that the air they breathed contained
psychoactive compounds. Their contentment was not a choice but a chemical
state imposed on them by organisms that were optimizing for their own
reproductive success. The colonists' agency — their capacity to choose
their own emotional and psychological state — had been compromised. This
was wrong.

But the conventional answer, Elise realized, contained an assumption that
she was not certain she could defend: the assumption that the colonists'
pre-exposure psychological state — their anxiety, their aggression, their
relentless drive to modify and exploit their environment — was their
"natural" state, the state to which they had a right, the state that
constituted their authentic selves.

This assumption was, from a biological perspective, incoherent. Human
neurochemistry was not a fixed quantity. It was shaped by diet,
environment, social interaction, sleep, exercise, sunlight, altitude, and
a thousand other variables, all of which modified the brain's chemical
balance without the individual's conscious awareness or consent. A person
who moved from a high-stress environment to a low-stress environment
experienced neurochemical changes — reduced cortisol, increased serotonin
— that altered their behavior and their subjective experience. Nobody
called this a violation of autonomy. Nobody demanded that the person be
returned to their previous stress level in order to preserve their
"authentic" psychological state.

The pollen was, in one sense, merely another environmental variable. The
colonists breathed it the way they breathed the air, drank the water, ate
the food — all of which contained molecules that interacted with their
neurochemistry. The difference was one of degree, not kind. And the
result — reduced aggression, increased contentment, a sustainable
relationship with the planetary ecology — was, by any reasonable measure,
beneficial.

Unless you believed that human beings had a right to be unhappy.

Unless you believed that ambition, aggression, and the drive to
dominate the environment were essential components of what it meant to
be human.

Unless you believed that the capacity for destruction was inseparable
from the capacity for creation, and that a species robbed of its
restlessness was a species robbed of its future.

Elise sat in her sealed laboratory and breathed her filtered air and
thought about the oak trees outside, their canopies spread against
Demeter's orange sky, their pollen drifting on the wind, their roots
threaded through the soil's mycorrhizal networks, their slow, patient,
unconscious strategy playing out across the generations, and she thought:
They are better at this than we are.

Ten thousand years of agriculture. Ten thousand years of breeding and
selecting and modifying plants to serve human purposes. And in three years
on a terraformed world, the plants had begun to breed and select and
modify their modifiers.

Domestication, Elise knew, had always been a two-way process. Wheat had
changed humans as profoundly as humans had changed wheat — reshaping
diets, settlement patterns, social structures, the very shape of
civilizations. The difference was that wheat's domestication of humans
had operated over millennia, gradually, invisibly, through the slow
accretion of dependency and adaptation. The Demeter trees were doing the
same thing in three years. Their engineering had given them a head start.

She wrote her report. She documented the alkaloids, their neurochemical
mechanisms, their evolutionary origin, their effects on the colonial
population. She recommended that the Authority commission a full
investigation, that the colonists be informed, and that a decision
regarding the colony's future be made by the colonists themselves, in full
possession of the facts.

She did not recommend evacuation. She did not recommend deforestation. She
did not recommend intervention.

She left the recommendation section incomplete, because she did not know
what to recommend, and she was honest enough to admit it.

                              VII.

On her last day on Demeter, Elise walked through the central garden. She
had removed her filter mask. She breathed the open air and felt the pollen
settle on her skin and in her lungs and she thought about the oaks above
her, their engineered genomes and their evolved alkaloids, their
magnificent, unconscious intelligence.

A child ran past her on the path, laughing, chasing a ball that rolled
through the golden-dusted grass. A woman on a bench looked up from a book
and smiled at Elise — a real smile, warm and unguarded, the smile of a
person who was not afraid and not anxious and not driven to compete or
compare or consume.

The air smelled of honey.

Elise stood in the garden and let the pollen fall on her and thought: This
is what a sustainable relationship between a species and its environment
looks like. Not a garden maintained by human will, but a garden that
maintains its gardeners. Not domestication but mutualism — or something
that looked like mutualism, if you did not look too closely at the
chemistry.

She thought about her report, sitting in the colony's communications
queue, waiting to be transmitted to the Authority. She thought about what
would happen when the Authority received it. She thought about committees
and investigations and policy decisions and the slow, grinding machinery
of institutional response.

And she thought about the oaks, which did not think at all, which simply
grew and reproduced and dispersed their pollen on the wind, which had no
strategy and no intention and no consciousness, and which were,
nevertheless, winning.

The pollen fell. The child laughed. The woman smiled. The trees breathed.

Elise breathed with them.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                    BLUEPRINTS FOR A BETTER BOMB

                        by Franklin Hoyt

================================================================================

                              I.

The bomb was clean. That was the whole point of it, and that was the
problem.

Dr. Nathan Pierce stood in the viewing gallery above Test Chamber Seven
at the Sandia Weapons Analysis Facility and looked at the device on the
platform below — a squat, matte-gray cylinder, sixty-two centimeters in
diameter and ninety-one centimeters long, unglamorous as a water heater —
and he thought: I have made the worst thing in the world better, and
better is worse.

The device was designated W-47/C, the C standing for "clean," which was
a weapons-laboratory euphemism for "producing minimal residual
radioactivity." A standard nuclear weapon of comparable yield — thirty
kilotons, roughly twice the Hiroshima bomb — would contaminate its target
area with fallout that rendered the ground lethal for weeks and dangerous
for years. The W-47/C would not. Its design — Pierce's design, the product
of four years of theoretical work and eighteen months of engineering
refinement — used a lithium-deuteride fusion boost with a modified
tamper that captured ninety-three percent of the fission products,
converting them to short-lived isotopes that decayed to safe levels within
seventy-two hours.

Three days after detonation, you could walk into the blast zone.

This was, in the language of the Defense Department's procurement
specifications, a "enhanced post-strike operational environment" — meaning
that the territory destroyed by the weapon could be occupied by friendly
forces within three days, rather than the weeks or months required after
a conventional nuclear strike. In the language of strategic doctrine, it
was a "usable" nuclear weapon — a weapon that could be employed
tactically, in a theater of operations, without rendering that theater
permanently uninhabitable. In the language of the men who made policy in
the Pentagon and the White House, it was a breakthrough.

In the language of Nathan Pierce, who had designed it and who understood
with the clarity of a man who has spent his career studying the physics of
destruction, it was an invitation to nuclear war.

                              II.

Pierce had come to weapons work the way most physicists of his generation
had: through the gravity well of Los Alamos, which pulled in talented minds
with the same inexorable force that a black hole pulls in light. He had
been twenty-two in 1945, a graduate student in nuclear physics at Howard
University, when the bomb fell on Hiroshima, and he had understood
immediately — with the physicist's peculiar combination of professional
admiration and moral horror — both the elegance of the design and the
magnitude of what it meant.

He had not gone to Los Alamos during the war. Howard University's
physics department, like Howard University itself, occupied a particular
position in the landscape of American science: respected but segregated,
its students and faculty operating within the constraints of a system that
valued their minds in the abstract and excluded their bodies in the
concrete. Pierce had applied for war-related research positions and been
rejected, not for lack of qualification but for excess of pigmentation,
and he had spent the war years teaching undergraduate physics and working
on his dissertation while his white classmates went off to the Manhattan
Project and came back with security clearances and government contracts and
a shared, terrible knowledge.

The integration of the federal laboratories came slowly, grudgingly, and
incompletely in the years after the war, and Pierce entered weapons
research in 1952, when the Sandia facility offered him a position as a
theoretical physicist in the Advanced Weapons Concepts division. He
accepted because the work was important, because the work was interesting,
and because — he would admit this to himself only in his most honest
moments — because he wanted to prove that a Negro physicist could do
what the white physicists had done, could master the same mathematics,
could design the same machines, could participate in the same terrible,
necessary enterprise that had defined his generation's relationship with
the future.

He proved it. In twelve years at Sandia, Pierce had contributed to the
design of seven production weapons and authored thirty-two classified
theoretical papers on fusion weapon physics. He was respected. He was
consulted. He was the only Black scientist at his classification level in
the weapons complex, a distinction that was never mentioned in official
contexts and never forgotten in unofficial ones. His colleagues treated
him with the careful, self-conscious fairness of men who wanted to believe
that meritocracy was real and who needed Pierce's presence to sustain the
belief.

And he had designed the clean bomb, because the physics was beautiful and
the engineering was elegant and because he had spent four years immersed
in the theoretical problem of fission product capture without stepping
back far enough to see the strategic implications of its solution.

He saw them now.

                              III.

The briefing was held in Conference Room A at the Pentagon, a windowless
space with oak paneling and a long mahogany table and the particular
institutional hush of a room where consequential decisions were made by
people who had not earned the right to make them.

Pierce had been summoned to present the W-47/C to the Joint Chiefs'
Strategic Weapons Assessment Panel, a committee of uniformed and civilian
officials whose function was to evaluate new weapons systems for potential
integration into the nation's nuclear arsenal. The panel consisted of
eight men — all white, which Pierce noticed with the automatic, exhausted
attentiveness of a man who had been counting for thirty years — seated
along one side of the table. Pierce sat on the other side, alone except
for his briefing materials and the classified technical summary that he
had prepared and that he now, for the first time, wished he had never
written.

"Dr. Pierce." The panel chairman was a rear admiral named Whitfield, a
lean, gray man with the compressed energy of a torpedo. "Your W-47/C has
generated considerable interest. Walk us through the operational
parameters."

Pierce walked them through it. He described the physics — the lithium-
deuteride boost, the modified tamper, the fission product capture
mechanism — with the precision and authority of a man who understood every
atom of the design. He presented the yield calculations, the blast radii,
the thermal radiation profiles. He presented the residual radioactivity
projections: ninety-three percent fission product capture, seventy-two-
hour decay to safe occupancy levels.

The panel listened. They did not interrupt. When Pierce finished, the
silence was the particular silence of men who are calculating.

"Seventy-two hours," said a civilian member of the panel — a deputy
assistant secretary of defense named Hargrave, a soft, pinkish man who
spoke with the careful enthusiasm of a person accustomed to selling
unpleasant things in pleasant language. "So we could, theoretically, use
this weapon against a Soviet armored column advancing through the Fulda
Gap, and our forces could advance through the strike zone within three
days."

"Theoretically, yes," Pierce said.

"And the weapon's yield is sufficient to destroy an armored division?"

"A thirty-kiloton detonation at optimal altitude would produce
catastrophic thermal and blast effects over an area of approximately eight
square kilometers. An armored division concentrated in that area would be
effectively destroyed."

"With no lasting contamination."

"With contamination that decays to safe occupancy levels within seventy-two
hours. I should emphasize that 'safe' in this context is a relative term.
The short-lived isotopes—"

"Yes, but the point is, we could use it. Tactically. Without turning
Central Europe into a wasteland."

Pierce looked at Hargrave. The man's expression was bright, almost eager,
the expression of a customer who has found exactly what he was shopping
for. And Pierce understood, with the cold, precise clarity that had served
him well in physics and that now served him in a capacity he had not
anticipated, exactly what Hargrave was buying.

"Mr. Hargrave," Pierce said. "I want to be certain that the strategic
implications of this weapon are clearly understood."

"We understand the implications perfectly, Doctor. This weapon makes
tactical nuclear warfare viable."

"That is what concerns me."

The room's attention sharpened.

"The current strategic doctrine," Pierce continued, "is built on the
principle of mutual assured destruction. Nuclear weapons are not used
because their use guarantees the destruction of both parties. This
deterrent functions precisely because nuclear weapons are unusable — because
their effects are so catastrophic, so indiscriminate, and so long-lasting
that no rational actor would employ them. The W-47/C undermines this
calculus. By creating a nuclear weapon whose effects are contained and
temporary, we create a nuclear weapon that can be used. And a nuclear
weapon that can be used will be used."

"That's a policy judgment, Doctor," Admiral Whitfield said. "You're a
physicist."

"I am a physicist who designed this weapon, Admiral. I understand its
capabilities better than anyone in this room. And I am telling you that
the W-47/C does not make nuclear war safer. It makes nuclear war more
likely, because it makes nuclear war seem survivable."

"Seem?" Hargrave said.

"Seem. The W-47/C reduces fallout from a single tactical detonation. It
does not reduce blast effects, thermal radiation, or electromagnetic
pulse. It does not prevent escalation. If we use a clean tactical weapon
against a Soviet armored column, the Soviet response will not be a clean
tactical weapon. The Soviet response will be whatever they have available,
which is dirty, high-yield, and indiscriminate. The W-47/C does not
prevent Armageddon. It provides a doorway into Armageddon that looks,
from the outside, like a reasonable entrance."

The room was quiet. Admiral Whitfield regarded Pierce with the expression
of a man who has received an engineering report that contradicts the
construction schedule.

"Your concerns are noted, Doctor. Thank you for the briefing."

Pierce gathered his materials. He knew what "noted" meant in the language
of the Pentagon. It meant "filed." It meant "ignored." It meant that the
W-47/C would proceed to the next stage of evaluation, and the stage after
that, and the stage after that, until it reached production, because the
machinery of weapons procurement moved in one direction only, and the
direction was forward, and the fuel was momentum, and the destination was
a stockpile.

                              IV.

He drove back to Sandia that evening through the New Mexico desert, the
road a black ribbon through the sage and the juniper, the sky enormous
above him, the stars appearing one by one as the light faded. He drove
with the windows down and the radio off and the equations running in his
head — not the equations of the bomb, which were settled and irrevocable,
but the equations of what to do about the bomb, which were unsolvable.

He thought about Barbara, at home in their house on the edge of
Albuquerque, grading papers from her constitutional law class at the
university, and he thought about the conversation they would have tonight,
which would be the same conversation they had been having for three
months, since the first successful simulation of the W-47/C's fission
product capture mechanism — the conversation in which Barbara asked him
whether he could live with what he had built, and he told her he was
working on it, and she looked at him with the expression of a woman who
loved a man but could not love what the man had made.

He thought about his father, who had worked in the Government Printing
Office for thirty-seven years and who had believed, with the unselfconscious
faith of a man who served his country despite his country's refusal to
fully serve him, that the institutions of government were, in the long
run, perfectible. His father would have said: Work within the system. File
your objections. Trust the process. His father had believed in processes
and procedures and the gradual improvement of imperfect institutions,
because his father had been born in 1895 and had seen the world change —
slowly, insufficiently, but undeniably — and had concluded that the
direction, if not the speed, was correct.

Pierce was not sure the direction was correct. He was not sure that a
nation that had dropped two atomic bombs on civilian populations and was
now spending billions of dollars to build better ones was moving in a
direction that his father would have recognized as improvement. He was not
sure that the process could be trusted, because the process had produced
the W-47/C, and the W-47/C would produce a world in which nuclear war
was thinkable, and a world in which nuclear war was thinkable was a world
that was already lost.

He arrived home. Barbara was in the kitchen, grading papers. She looked
up.

"How was Washington?"

"They loved it."

"Ah."

That was all she said. The syllable contained everything.

                              V.

He began to sabotage his own work on a Tuesday.

The method was precise, because Pierce was a precise man, and it was
subtle, because the alternative to subtlety was prison. He could not
destroy the W-47/C — the design existed in classified documents, in
computer simulations, in the institutional memory of the weapons
laboratory. Destroying his copy would accomplish nothing. Nor could he
publicly denounce the weapon without violating the security clearances
that governed his knowledge and spending the rest of his life in a
federal penitentiary, a prospect that held no appeal and would serve no
purpose beyond allowing the weapons program to replace him with someone
who had fewer objections.

What he could do — what his position and his expertise uniquely qualified
him to do — was introduce doubt.

The W-47/C's viability rested on the ninety-three percent fission product
capture rate. Below ninety percent, the residual contamination would be
sufficient to delay post-strike occupation by weeks rather than days,
which eliminated the weapon's tactical advantage, which eliminated the
reason for its existence. The capture rate depended on a complex
interaction of tamper geometry, neutron flux density, and lithium-deuteride
compression dynamics — variables that were calculable in theory and
uncertain in practice, because no one had yet tested the design, and
computer simulations, however sophisticated, were approximations of
reality, not reality itself.

Pierce began to modify his simulations.

Not dramatically. Not in ways that would be detectable to a casual
reviewer or even a competent one. He adjusted input parameters within their
accepted uncertainty ranges — shifting a neutron cross-section estimate
toward the lower bound of its error bar, modifying a compression timing
parameter by a fraction that was defensible as a conservative assumption.
Each individual adjustment was minor. Each was scientifically justifiable.
In combination, they produced simulation results that showed the fission
product capture rate declining from ninety-three percent to eighty-seven
percent as the model incorporated "more conservative" assumptions about
real-world performance.

Eighty-seven percent was not enough. At eighty-seven percent, the
residual contamination would require a fourteen-day waiting period before
occupation. At fourteen days, the tactical advantage evaporated. The
weapon became just another nuclear bomb — devastating, indiscriminate,
useful only for the mutual destruction that the current doctrine already
provided for.

He presented the revised simulations to his division chief, a competent
physicist named Mueller who had been at Sandia for twenty years and who
reviewed Pierce's work with the respect due to a colleague and the rigor
due to a classified program.

"Your capture rate has dropped," Mueller said.

"The revised models incorporate more conservative assumptions about
tamper-neutron interaction at the compression interface. I've published
three papers on this interaction since the original model, and my more
recent data suggests the earlier estimates were optimistic."

Mueller studied the data. "You're using the lower bound of the Grigoriev
cross-section for lithium-7."

"Grigoriev's experimental uncertainty is plus or minus four percent. The
original model used the median. I'm using the lower bound, which is
equally defensible."

"It gives you a lower capture rate."

"It gives us a more conservative estimate. I would rather present a
conservative estimate to the Pentagon and be pleasantly surprised by test
results than present an optimistic estimate and have the weapon fail to
perform in the field."

Mueller looked at him. Mueller was not a fool. He was a weapons physicist
who had spent two decades in a culture of classification and compartment-
alization, and he understood that data could be presented in many ways and
that the choice of presentation was never purely scientific. But he was
also a man who respected Pierce's work and who had no reason — yet — to
suspect that Pierce's revised assumptions were motivated by anything other
than professional caution.

"Run it again with the median values," Mueller said. "Both versions go in
the report."

"Of course."

Pierce ran it again. Both versions went in the report. But the revised
version — the conservative version, the version that showed the capture
rate at eighty-seven percent — was presented first, and it was accompanied
by Pierce's analysis, which argued, persuasively and at length, that the
conservative estimate was the more reliable. The median version appeared
in an appendix.

Reports are read front-to-back. Appendices are not read at all.

                              VI.

It was not enough.

The weapons assessment panel reviewed the report and concluded that even
at the revised capture rate, the W-47/C's performance was "within
acceptable parameters for continued development." Hargrave, the deputy
assistant secretary, was particularly enthusiastic, noting in his
assessment that "even a fourteen-day occupation delay represents a
significant improvement over existing weapons" and recommending "expedited
testing to resolve the uncertainty in capture rate estimates."

Testing. Pierce had not anticipated testing — or rather, he had anticipated
it and had hoped that the reduced simulation results would delay it beyond
the current budget cycle, which would mean a new review, a new committee,
new opportunities for doubt to accumulate. But the panel had moved faster
than he expected, and the Defense Department had allocated funding for a
proof-of-concept test, and Pierce was now in the position of a saboteur
whose sabotage had been acknowledged as a minor inconvenience and scheduled
for resolution.

He sat in his office at Sandia — a small, windowless room with a desk, a
blackboard, and a photograph of Barbara on the shelf beside his classified
files — and he calculated his options with the same rigor he applied to
neutron flux densities.

He could continue the subtle approach. He could adjust more parameters,
introduce more conservative assumptions, publish more papers that cast
doubt on the optimistic estimates. This would slow the program but not
stop it. The machinery of weapons development had its own momentum, and
doubt was merely friction, not a barrier.

He could go public. He could violate his security clearance, contact the
press, explain to the American people what the W-47/C was and what it
meant. This would stop the program — possibly — and it would also destroy
his career, his freedom, and his family's security. It would also, he
calculated, achieve less than the sacrifice warranted, because the American
public had demonstrated, across two decades of nuclear weapons development,
a remarkable capacity for being told terrible things and continuing to eat
breakfast.

He could resign. He could walk away from the weapons laboratory and the
classified files and the equations that he now understood were not
abstract mathematics but blueprints for a machine that would make the
unthinkable thinkable. This would remove him from the problem but would
not remove the problem. Someone else would complete the work. Someone
without his doubts, without his understanding of the strategic
implications, without his sleepless nights.

He could do nothing. He could continue to work on the program, attend the
briefings, refine the simulations, watch the weapon progress toward
production, and live with the knowledge that he had built a better bomb
and that "better," in the vocabulary of nuclear weapons, was the most
dangerous word in the English language.

He looked at the photograph of Barbara. She was smiling in the photograph,
because photographs preserve smiles, and he thought about the smile she
did not wear when he came home from work, and he thought about the
conversation they would have tonight, which would be the same conversation,
which would end the same way.

He thought about the equation that he could not solve: the equation that
balanced the physicist's love of beautiful theory against the citizen's
responsibility for its consequences.

He picked up the telephone and called Mueller.

"I need to talk to you about the test protocol," he said. "I have some
additional concerns about the instrumentation requirements. If we don't
instrument correctly, the test data won't resolve the capture rate
uncertainty, and we'll have spent fifty million dollars proving nothing."

"What do you need?"

"Additional neutron flux detectors in the secondary capture zone. High-
resolution gamma spectrometry at the twelve-hour, twenty-four-hour, and
forty-eight-hour marks. And I want independent radiochemical analysis of
the fallout samples — not Sandia's lab, but an outside facility. Lawrence
Livermore, or Los Alamos."

"That'll add six months to the test schedule."

"It'll also add credibility to the results. If we're going to give the
Pentagon a clean bomb, we'd better be damn sure it's clean."

Mueller was quiet for a moment. "You want to delay the test."

"I want to instrument the test correctly. If that delays it, so be it."

"Pierce. Are you trying to kill this program?"

The question hung in the air between them like a neutron between capture
and escape.

"I'm trying to make sure that if this weapon enters the arsenal, it
works as advertised," Pierce said. "Because if it doesn't — if the
capture rate is eighty-seven percent and not ninety-three, and we deploy
it based on optimistic assumptions, and it fails in the field — we won't
just have a military failure. We'll have a contaminated battlefield and
a public that was told the weapon was clean and has now learned that
'clean' was a euphemism for 'slightly less catastrophic.' The political
fallout — if you'll pardon the expression — will be worse than the
radiological fallout."

Mueller said nothing for a long time.

"I'll approve the additional instrumentation," he said. "Six months. But
Pierce — the program moves forward. You understand that. The program
moves forward."

"I understand."

He hung up the telephone. Six months. He had bought six months. In six
months, the political landscape might shift. In six months, the test-ban
negotiations in Geneva might produce an agreement. In six months, a new
president might take office with different priorities. In six months,
something might change.

Or nothing might change, and the test would proceed, and the data would
come back, and the capture rate would be ninety-three percent after all,
because Pierce's revised assumptions were conservative by design and not
by necessity, and the weapon would work, and the stockpile would grow by
one, and the world would be that much closer to the edge.

Pierce sat in his windowless office and looked at the blackboard where the
equations lived — the beautiful, terrible equations that described the
conversion of matter into energy, the compression of deuterium nuclei,
the capture of neutrons, the arithmetic of destruction rendered in the
clean, dispassionate notation of physics — and he thought: I am a man who
builds bombs and tries to unbuild them. I am an engineer in reverse.

The equations did not care. The equations were correct. That was the
horror of it: the equations were always correct. It was only the uses to
which men put them that were wrong.

He turned off the light and drove home through the desert, under the
enormous New Mexico sky, where the stars burned with the indifference of
fusion reactions that had nothing to do with weapons or politics or the
small, desperate calculations of a man who had built a better bomb and
was trying to figure out how to make it worse.

                        RESONANCE ENGINE

                      by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                              I.

The signal was embedded in the cosmic microwave background radiation at a
frequency of 160.2 gigahertz, and it should not have existed.

Dr. Tomasz Wren found it at 3:17 AM on a Wednesday, which was, in his
experience, the hour at which the universe preferred to reveal its secrets
— when the mind was emptied of the day's noise and the instruments hummed
alone in the dark and the data appeared on the screen with the patience
of something that had been waiting to be noticed for thirteen billion
years.

Wren was a radio astronomer at the Cerro Paranal Observatory in Chile,
where the European Southern Observatory maintained its Very Large Telescope
array and where Wren, for the past three years, had been conducting a
high-resolution survey of the cosmic microwave background — the faint
thermal radiation that permeated the observable universe, the afterglow
of the Big Bang, the oldest light in existence. The survey was a
refinement project: using the latest generation of microwave detectors,
cooled to within a fraction of a degree of absolute zero, Wren was mapping
the CMB's temperature fluctuations at a resolution ten times finer than
any previous survey, searching for patterns in the primordial radiation
that might constrain models of cosmic inflation — the hypothetical period
of exponential expansion in the universe's first fraction of a second.

The fluctuations were there, as expected: tiny variations in the
radiation's temperature, on the order of one part in a hundred thousand,
imprinted on the universe's fabric like the watermark in a sheet of paper.
These fluctuations were the seeds of all structure in the cosmos — the
density variations in the primordial plasma that, under the influence of
gravity, would eventually grow into galaxies, galaxy clusters, and the
vast cosmic web of matter that defined the universe's large-scale
architecture. The fluctuations were well-studied, well-understood, and
thoroughly catalogued by previous surveys. They held no surprises.

The signal at 160.2 gigahertz was not a fluctuation.

It was a harmonic.

                              II.

Wren stared at the data for forty-seven minutes before he allowed himself
to believe what he was seeing. This was not excessive caution; this was the
minimum professional response to a result that, if genuine, contradicted
the standard cosmological model in a manner so fundamental that the
contradiction itself seemed more likely to be an error than a discovery.

The signal appeared as a spectral line — a narrow peak in the radiation's
frequency distribution at 160.2 gigahertz, superimposed on the smooth
thermal spectrum of the CMB. This was, in itself, remarkable but not
unprecedented; spectral lines in the CMB had been predicted by certain
models of early-universe physics, and their detection would be a
significant observational result. What made Wren's signal extraordinary
was not the line itself but its relationship to other features in the data.

At 80.1 gigahertz — precisely half the signal's frequency — there was
another spectral feature. Fainter, broader, but unmistakably present. At
320.4 gigahertz — precisely double the signal's frequency — there was a
third. At 480.6 gigahertz — three times the fundamental — a fourth. The
pattern continued, with decreasing amplitude, through seven detectable
overtones, spanning the frequency range from 80.1 to 1,121.4 gigahertz.

The features formed a harmonic series.

In acoustics, a harmonic series is the set of frequencies produced by a
vibrating object — a string, a column of air, a drumhead. The fundamental
frequency is the lowest note; the overtones are integer multiples of the
fundamental, each one higher and fainter than the last. A harmonic series
is the signature of resonance — of a physical system vibrating at its
natural frequencies, organizing energy into a structured pattern of sound.

A harmonic series in the cosmic microwave background was not acoustics. It
was cosmology. And its implications were, in Wren's careful professional
judgment, either the most significant discovery in the history of
observational physics or the most spectacular instrumental artifact.

He ran the diagnostic protocols. He checked the detectors, the amplifiers,
the signal processing chain, the calibration references. He examined the
data for systematic effects: atmospheric contamination, ground pickup,
interference from terrestrial sources, artifacts of the analysis software.
He reprocessed the raw data from scratch, using three independent analysis
pipelines. He rotated the telescope to observe a different patch of sky.

The signal was everywhere. In every direction, at every frequency in the
harmonic series, with the same amplitude ratios and the same spectral
widths. It was isotropic — uniform across the sky — which meant it was
either an instrumental artifact that affected every detector in the same
way regardless of pointing direction, or it was a genuine feature of the
cosmic microwave background, embedded in the radiation that filled the
entire observable universe.

Wren sat in the control room at Cerro Paranal and listened to the wind
outside the dome and the hum of the cryogenic systems and the silence of
a result that would not go away.

He did not sleep that night. He did not sleep the following night. On the
third night, he called his colleague.

                              III.

Dr. Annika Lindqvist was a theoretical cosmologist at the University of
Stockholm and one of the five or six people on the planet who possessed
both the mathematical background and the temperament to evaluate what
Wren had found without either dismissing it reflexively or embracing it
credulously. She was also Wren's former doctoral advisor, a woman who had
trained him to distrust his own enthusiasm and to subject every result to
the most hostile interpretation he could devise before allowing himself to
take it seriously.

She flew to Chile. She arrived at Paranal forty-six hours after his call,
carrying a laptop and a suitcase and the particular expression of
controlled intensity that Wren recognized from their years of
collaboration — the expression of a mind that was already working on
the problem and wanted the data to catch up.

He showed her the data. He walked her through the analysis. He presented
the diagnostics, the cross-checks, the null tests. She listened in
silence, her face illuminated by the blue light of the display screens,
her fingers moving occasionally across her laptop as she made calculations
that Wren could not follow.

When he finished, she was quiet for a long time.

"You have checked for foreground contamination."

"Galactic synchrotron, free-free emission, thermal dust. All subtracted
using the standard component separation pipeline. The harmonic series
survives the subtraction."

"Instrumental cross-talk between detector channels."

"The features appear in channels that have no electronic coupling. I've
confirmed this with the instrument team."

"The atmospheric transmission at 160 gigahertz is poor. This is a
region where—"

"The atmospheric model has been verified against balloon-borne
measurements. The correction is robust."

"Then you have a harmonic series in the cosmic microwave background."

"I have a harmonic series in the cosmic microwave background."

Lindqvist removed her glasses and polished them on her sleeve — a gesture
Wren remembered from a thousand hours in her office in Stockholm, a
gesture that meant she was thinking deeply and did not want her vision
to interfere.

"A harmonic series implies resonance," she said. "Resonance implies a
bounded system — a cavity, a medium with reflecting boundaries, something
that confines the vibration and allows standing waves to form. The
standard cosmological model does not predict such a system in the early
universe. The primordial plasma was effectively infinite in extent. Infinite
media do not resonate."

"Unless the medium is not infinite."

"Unless the medium is not infinite. Which would mean the universe has a
finite topology — a closed geometry, a boundary condition. This is not
ruled out by observation, but it is not supported either. And even a
finite topology would produce a specific harmonic signature that depends
on the geometry — a three-torus, a Poincare dodecahedral space, a
three-sphere. Your harmonic series would have to match one of these
geometries."

"It doesn't."

Lindqvist looked at him.

"I've compared the amplitude ratios of the overtones against every known
closed cosmological topology. None of them match. The ratios are—" He
hesitated. This was the part that he had not been able to say aloud,
because saying it aloud would make it real, and making it real would
require him to confront its implications. "The ratios are consistent with
a designed harmonic structure. Not a natural resonance pattern. Not the
eigenfrequencies of a physical cavity. A composed sequence."

"Composed."

"The overtone amplitudes follow a pattern that is inconsistent with any
physical resonance mechanism I can identify. The ratios between successive
overtones are not determined by the geometry of a resonating cavity. They
are determined by — I don't know how to say this in a way that doesn't
sound insane."

"Say it."

"They are determined by aesthetic considerations. The amplitude ratios
produce a harmonic structure that is, from a musical perspective,
consonant. Pleasing. The intervals between the fundamental and the
overtones correspond to musical intervals — a perfect fifth, a major
third, a minor seventh. The harmonic series embedded in the cosmic
microwave background is a chord."

The control room was very quiet. The wind moved outside the dome. The
cryogenic systems hummed. The data glowed on the screens.

"Tomasz," Lindqvist said.

"I know."

"You are telling me that the universe is a composition."

"I am telling you that the oldest radiation in the universe contains a
harmonic structure that is consistent with a designed, musically coherent
signal. I am telling you that the cosmic microwave background — the
afterglow of the Big Bang, the thermal residue of the universe's origin
— is not noise. It is not random. It is structured. It is ordered. It
has the properties of a sound that was produced, not emitted. A sound
that was made."

"By what?"

"I don't know."

                              IV.

They spent a week at Paranal, working in the control room from dusk to
dawn — the schedule of observational astronomers, nocturnal by necessity,
their days inverted, their social rhythms shaped by the rotation of the
planet relative to the stars. Wren presented data. Lindqvist interrogated
it. They argued, calculated, compared, and rechecked, the conversation
between them moving with the practiced efficiency of people who had
learned to think together and who understood each other's analytical
rhythms.

Lindqvist attempted to construct a natural explanation for the harmonic
series. She explored every theoretical framework that might produce a
consonant harmonic structure in the early universe: cosmic strings
vibrating at their fundamental frequencies, phase transitions in the
primordial plasma creating resonant cavities, exotic particle physics
generating periodic spectral features. Each framework produced harmonic
signatures, but none produced the specific amplitude ratios that Wren
had observed. The ratios were wrong — or, more precisely, the ratios
were right in a way that no physical theory predicted.

"The problem," Lindqvist said on the fourth night, her voice carrying the
particular flat tone of a scientist confronting the failure of her
analytical tools, "is that the amplitude ratios have structure that is
independent of any physical mechanism. The ratios are what they are not
because of the physics of the early universe but because of — I keep
returning to your word — aesthetic considerations. The harmonic series is
beautiful. And the universe is not in the habit of being beautiful for
beauty's sake."

"Isn't it?" Wren said.

Lindqvist looked at him sharply.

"The spiral structure of galaxies," he said. "The hexagonal storms on
Saturn. The Fibonacci patterns in — everything, from shells to flowers to
the distribution of leaves on a stem. The universe is full of beautiful
structures. We explain them through physics — angular momentum, fluid
dynamics, optimization of energy configurations. But the explanations
are after the fact. The beauty comes first. The physics explains why the
beauty works, not why it exists."

"That is a philosophical argument, not a physical one."

"Yes. And the data is pushing me toward philosophy, because physics has
run out of explanations."

Lindqvist was quiet for a long time. When she spoke, her voice was
careful.

"There is a class of explanation that we have not considered. I have not
considered it because it falls outside the domain of science as I
understand it. But we are scientists, and our obligation is to the data,
not to our comfort."

"Say it."

"If the harmonic series is designed — if its structure reflects intention
rather than physics — then the question is not 'what physical mechanism
produced it?' but 'what entity composed it?' And that question is not a
physics question. It is a theological question."

The word fell into the control room like a stone into still water.

"I am not a theologian," Wren said.

"Neither am I. But we are looking at data that has no physical
explanation and a clear structural explanation, and the structural
explanation implies a composer. I am not arguing that the data proves the
existence of God. I am arguing that the data is consistent with the
existence of an organizing intelligence that operated at or before the
origin of the universe, and that consistency is not something I can
dismiss on scientific grounds."

"On what grounds can you dismiss it?"

"On no grounds whatsoever. Which is the problem."

                              V.

Wren walked outside. The Atacama Desert at night was the closest thing on
Earth to the surface of another planet: barren, cold, the air so dry and
thin that the stars blazed with an intensity that was almost violent,
unmodified by atmosphere, unfiltered by moisture, the raw light of fusion
reactions billions of years old arriving at his retinas with a directness
that made him feel exposed.

He stood on the observatory platform and looked at the sky and thought
about what he had found.

He was a materialist. He had been a materialist since the age of sixteen,
when he had read a popular cosmology book and understood, with the
particular clarity of adolescent revelation, that the universe could be
described — completely, rigorously, without remainder — by the laws of
physics. Matter and energy, governed by equations, producing every
phenomenon from the fusion of hydrogen in stellar cores to the firing of
neurons in the human brain. There was no need for anything else. The
equations were sufficient. The universe was a machine, elegant and
impersonal, and understanding it was a matter of writing down the right
equations and solving them.

This conviction had sustained him through a doctorate in radio astronomy,
through three years of painstaking observational work at Paranal, through
the long nights of data analysis and the longer days of doubt. The
universe was a machine. The machine could be understood. Understanding was
the highest human achievement. This was his faith — if the word could be
applied without irony to a conviction that defined itself against faith.

And now the machine had produced a signal that the machine could not
explain.

A harmonic series. A chord. A sound that was structured not by physics
but by something that physics could not account for — something that looked,
to the analytic tools available to a radio astronomer in the twenty-first
century, like intention. Like design. Like composition.

He thought: If this is real — if the data survives peer review and
replication and the merciless scrutiny of a scientific community that
will resist this result with every tool at its disposal — then the
universe is not what I believed it was. The machine has a maker. Or, if
not a maker, then a property that functions like making — a tendency toward
order that is not merely physical but aesthetic, not merely structural but
musical, not merely there but composed.

He thought: This does not prove God. It proves a harmonic series. The
interpretation is mine.

He thought: But the interpretation is demanded by the data. The amplitude
ratios are not random. They are consonant. Consonance is not a physical
property; it is a perceptual property, a property that exists only in the
relationship between a sound and a listener. The universe contains a
chord, and the chord is beautiful, and beauty is not a category of physics.

He thought: I have spent my career measuring the universe's indifference,
and I have found, at its oldest and deepest level, something that looks
like care.

The stars burned above him. The desert was silent. The wind did not blow.

He went back inside and sat down at his workstation and began to write
the paper.

                              VI.

The paper was published in Physical Review Letters four months later,
after a review process that Wren's editor described, with British
understatement, as "spirited." The reviewers' reports ran to forty-seven
pages in total. Three reviewers recommended publication with revisions.
Two recommended rejection. The two who recommended rejection did not
challenge the data or the analysis; they challenged the interpretation,
arguing that the harmonic structure, while intriguing, almost certainly
reflected an unknown physical mechanism rather than an organizing
intelligence, and that the paper's language — particularly the use of the
word "composed" — was irresponsible.

Wren revised the paper. He softened the language. He replaced "composed"
with "structured in a manner consistent with intentional harmonic
organization." This satisfied no one, but it satisfied the editor, and
the paper was published.

The response was immediate, enormous, and incoherent.

The scientific community split along lines that were not entirely
scientific. Cosmologists attacked the data analysis. Radio astronomers
defended it. Particle physicists proposed exotic mechanisms that might
produce consonant harmonic series without invoking intelligence. String
theorists claimed the result as evidence for their own framework.
Theologians — who had not been consulted but who were not known for
waiting to be consulted — declared the result a vindication. Atheist
organizations called it an artifact. The popular press ran headlines that
ranged from "SCIENTIST HEARS THE VOICE OF GOD" to "RADIO STATIC
MISINTERPRETED AS DIVINE MUSIC."

Wren read none of it. He was at Paranal, running the observations again,
extending the survey to lower and higher frequencies, mapping the harmonic
series with increasing precision. The data did not change. The chord
remained. It was there — always there, everywhere, in every direction —
embedded in the oldest light, singing at a frequency that had traveled
for thirteen billion years to reach his detectors, a sound from the
beginning of everything.

Lindqvist called from Stockholm.

"Have you read the responses?"

"No."

"Don't. They are arguing about what you meant. They are not engaging
with what you found."

"What did I find, Annika?"

"You found a harmonic series in the cosmic microwave background. That is
what you found. Everything else is interpretation."

"Is it?"

"The data does not require a composer, Tomasz. It requires an explanation.
We do not yet have one. The absence of an explanation is not evidence of
a composer. It is evidence of our ignorance."

"And if we never find an explanation?"

"Then we live with the mystery. That is what scientists do. We live with
mysteries until they become explanations."

"And if this mystery never becomes an explanation? If the harmonic series
is irreducible — if it cannot be explained by any physical mechanism,
now or ever?"

"Then the universe contains something that science cannot explain. And
that would be interesting, and humbling, and it would change nothing about
how we do science. We would still observe. We would still measure. We
would still seek explanations. The chord would simply be there, in the
background, behind every observation, like — like—"

"Like music," Wren said.

                              VII.

He stayed at Paranal through the southern winter, working alone in the
control room through the long, cold nights, refining the measurements,
extending the analysis, listening.

The harmonic series was stable. Its frequencies did not shift, its
amplitudes did not vary. It was a fixed feature of the cosmic microwave
background, as permanent and as pervasive as the radiation itself. It
had been there since the beginning of the universe. It would be there
until the end — until the last photon of the CMB redshifted beyond
detection and the universe went dark and cold and silent.

Or not silent. The chord would remain, even when no instrument could
detect it. Sound did not require a listener. Music did not require an
audience. The universe had been singing for thirteen billion years before
Wren pointed his telescope at it. It would continue singing after the
telescope was dust.

He thought about this. He thought about it with the disciplined,
analytical precision of a trained scientist, and he thought about it with
the undisciplined, turbulent precision of a human being confronting
something that exceeded his categories.

He was a materialist. The harmonic series did not disprove materialism;
it disproved nothing. It was data. Data required explanation, and
explanation was the business of science, and science would, in time,
provide one. Perhaps the explanation would involve new physics —
mechanisms at the Planck scale, quantum gravity effects, properties of the
primordial plasma that current theories did not predict. Perhaps the
explanation would be mundane — an instrumental effect that had eluded
his diagnostics, a systematic error too subtle for his analysis to
detect. Perhaps.

But there was another possibility, and it was this possibility that kept
him at Paranal through the winter, alone in the control room, listening
to data that sounded, when he allowed the metaphor its full weight, like
music.

The possibility was that the universe was not a machine. That it was not
an accident. That the laws of physics, the constants of nature, the
geometry of spacetime, the initial conditions that produced the cosmic
microwave background and the galaxies and the stars and the planets and
the observers who pointed telescopes at the sky and measured what they
found — that all of this was not merely functional but intentional. Not
designed in the crude, interventionist sense of a watchmaker assembling
gears, but composed in the deep, structural sense of a musician writing
a symphony — the notes chosen not arbitrarily but with purpose, the
harmonies deliberate, the silences as meaningful as the sounds.

He could not prove this. He could not disprove it. He could only sit in
the control room at Cerro Paranal and look at the data and feel, with an
intensity that frightened him, that the universe was speaking and that he
had, by accident or by design, heard what it said.

The chord. The first chord. The sound that preceded all sounds, embedded
in the light that preceded all light, woven into the fabric of spacetime
at the moment of its creation. A sound that no instrument before his had
been sensitive enough to detect. A sound that no theory had predicted.
A sound that existed because — because the universe wished to sing. Because
existence itself was a musical act. Because being was not silence but
resonance, and the resonance was beautiful, and beauty was not an accident,
could not be an accident, was the fundamental property of a cosmos that
had chosen — if the word could be applied to something that encompassed
all choice — to be.

Wren sat in the dark and listened to the data and understood, with a
certainty that no equation could express and no experiment could test,
that the universe had been composed.

He did not know by what. He did not know for what purpose. He did not
know whether the composer was conscious or unconscious, personal or
impersonal, finite or infinite. He knew only that the evidence of
composition was there, in the data, in the harmonic series that sang
through the oldest light in the universe, and that hearing it had changed
everything he understood about the nature of existence.

He was still a scientist. He would still observe, still measure, still
seek explanations. But he would do so in a universe that was not
indifferent, not mechanical, not empty of meaning. He would do so in a
universe that contained, at its foundation, a chord.

The stars turned above the desert. The instruments hummed. The data
accumulated, point by patient point, on the screens before him.

Wren listened.

                         SALVAGE RIGHTS

                       by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

                              I.

Jace Malik saw the ship first, which was fitting, because Jace Malik saw
everything first. That was what you paid him for — those quick, black,
never-resting eyes that swept the scanner displays the way a hawk sweeps
a prairie, missing nothing, cataloguing everything, calculating the angle
and the distance and the dollar value of every piece of junk floating in
the Deep Reach before his partner had finished his coffee.

"There," Malik said, and jabbed his finger at the long-range display.
"Bearing one-eight-seven, range four hundred thousand klicks, closing at
orbital drift. Big one, Cap."

Captain Ed Rourke looked up from his mug — actual coffee, not the
reconstituted stuff, a luxury he permitted himself because a man who
spent eleven months a year in the Deep Reach picking through the bones
of dead ships was entitled to at least one genuine pleasure — and squinted
at the display. The contact was large. Very large. Larger than anything
they'd pulled in three years of working the salvage lanes between the
outer colonies.

"How big?" Rourke said.

"Spectrographic says she's running about two klicks stem to stern.
Mass estimate—" Malik whistled through his teeth. "Half a million tons,
give or take. She's not a freighter, Cap. She's not a warship. She's not
anything I've got in the registry."

Rourke set down his coffee. Half a million tons was a city. Half a million
tons was a generation ship.

"Is she broadcasting?"

"Negative. No transponder, no beacon, no emergency signal. She's dark."

"Life signs?"

Malik's fingers moved across the sensor board with the quick, precise
competence of a man who had been running salvage scans since he was
seventeen. "Thermals are — huh. Cap, she's warm. Not hot, not running,
but warm. Residual heat consistent with — I'm reading atmosphere. She's
got atmosphere. And—" He stopped. His eyes narrowed. "Biologics. Faint,
but positive. There are living things on that ship."

Rourke looked at the display for a long time. The contact drifted
through the void, silent, dark, warm, alive. A ship with no name, no
beacon, no signal, drifting in the Deep Reach where nothing drifted
unless it was lost.

"Well," Rourke said. "Let's go see."

                              II.

The Magpie was a salvage tug, sixty meters of scarred hull and heavy
grappling gear and the kind of rugged, no-nonsense engineering that you
got when a ship was built to work rather than to impress. She had been
Rourke's home for six years, and in those six years she had hauled in
forty-seven derelict vessels, twelve orbital platforms, three communications
satellites, and one deeply confused automated cargo drone that had been
circling a dead planet for eighty years waiting for a pickup signal that
would never come. Rourke had bought her with his Navy severance pay and
a loan from a bank in Ceres that charged eleven percent and asked no
questions, and he had paid off the loan in four years, which was not bad
for a man operating in a business where the margins were thin and the
competition was as rough as the space they worked in.

Salvage was simple. You found things that nobody owned anymore — ships
that had been abandoned, stations that had been decommissioned, debris
that had drifted beyond any claimed territory — and you brought them in
and sold them for scrap, or parts, or historical value, depending on
what you'd found and who was buying. The legal framework was
straightforward: under the Outer Space Salvage Convention of 2087, any
vessel or structure found derelict in unclaimed space — meaning without a
functioning transponder, without crew, and without a registered owner
within communication range — was legally salvageable. You filed a claim,
you hauled it in, you got paid. Clean, simple, honest work.

The generation ship was none of those things.

They matched velocity at a distance of five thousand meters and Rourke
got his first good look at her through the Magpie's external cameras. She
was enormous — two kilometers long, as Malik had estimated, with a
cylindrical hull that tapered slightly at both ends and a central axis
that suggested rotational gravity. Her hull was pitted and scarred,
darkened by centuries of micrometeorite impacts and radiation exposure,
but structurally intact. There were no visible breaches, no obvious
damage, no sign of the catastrophic failures that usually turned ships
into salvage. She was simply old. Very, very old.

"No markings," Malik said. "No registry numbers, no name plate, no
national or corporate insignia. She's pre-Convention, Cap. Way pre-
Convention. I'm running the hull profile against the historical database
and — got it." He paused. "Oh, hell."

"What?"

"She's the Covenant. Generation ship Covenant, launched 2043 from Earth
orbit, destination Tau Ceti system. Eight thousand colonists, four-
generation transit plan, estimated arrival—" Malik looked at Rourke.
"Estimated arrival 2187. That's a hundred and twelve years ago."

"She never arrived."

"No, sir, she did not. Lost contact in 2098, declared lost in 2115.
Eight thousand souls."

Rourke looked at the ship. The Covenant. He knew the name — everyone in
the Deep Reach knew the name. She was one of the great ghost stories of
deep space, one of the half-dozen generation ships that had launched in
the mid-twenty-first century and vanished, their fate unknown, their
passengers presumed dead. Children grew up hearing about the Covenant the
way children on Earth had once heard about the Marie Celeste or the Roanoke
Colony — a mystery, a cautionary tale, a reminder that space was big and
dark and did not care about human plans.

And she was here. Warm. Alive. With biologics on board.

"Malik," Rourke said slowly. "What exactly are those biologics?"

"Can't tell from here. Could be rats. Could be bacteria. Could be—"

"Could be people."

"Could be people."

Rourke drummed his fingers on the arm of his command chair. The Covenant
drifted before him, silent and vast, a ship that had been lost for two
centuries and was somehow not dead. Under the Salvage Convention, she was
a derelict — no transponder, no registered crew, no contact with her
launching authority. She was, by the letter of the law, salvageable. And
a two-kilometer generation ship, intact, with functioning life support,
was worth — Rourke did the calculation in his head — more money than he
would earn in ten lifetimes of hauling scrap.

But if there were people on board.

"Suit up," Rourke said. "We're going in."

                              III.

They entered through an auxiliary airlock on the ship's midsection —
Rourke, Malik, and their engineer, a quiet, competent woman named Sun
Hee-jin who had been with the Magpie for two years and who approached
every new situation with the calm pragmatism of a person who had learned
early that panicking was a waste of oxygen.

The airlock cycled. The inner door opened. Air hit their suit sensors —
breathable, warm, humid, rich with the organic scent of growing things.
The corridor beyond was dim, lit by bioluminescent strips along the ceiling
that cast a soft, blue-green glow. The walls were covered in vegetation —
vines, mosses, broad-leafed plants that Rourke could not identify,
growing out of cracks in the corridor panels, climbing the walls,
threading through the ceiling fixtures. The floor was soft with decomposed
plant matter.

"Atmosphere is good," Sun said, checking her sensors. "Oxygen nineteen
percent, nitrogen seventy-eight, CO2 slightly elevated. Temperature
twenty-four Celsius. Humidity eighty-two percent. Gravity — she's still
spinning, Cap. Point-seven G, approximately."

"Life support still running after two hundred years?"

"The basic systems are passive — the rotation provides gravity, the hull
provides radiation shielding, and I'm guessing the plants are doing most
of the atmospheric work at this point. She doesn't need power for life
support. She is life support."

They moved deeper into the ship. The corridors widened into what had once
been a residential section — rows of compartments, their doors open or
missing, their interiors overgrown with the same ubiquitous vegetation.
The original fixtures were barely visible beneath the growth: a bunk
frame here, a desk there, a shelf of objects so encrusted with moss
that their original function was unguessable. The ship had become a
greenhouse, a terrarium, a closed ecosystem that had been running
unsupervised for two centuries and had reached its own equilibrium.

They found the people in the central atrium.

The atrium was a cylindrical space at the ship's core, a hundred meters
in diameter and three hundred meters long, open to the ship's rotational
axis. It had been designed, Rourke guessed, as a common area — a park,
a meeting place, a reminder of open sky for people living inside a metal
tube. Now it was a forest. Trees grew from the deck — not planted in
rows but wild, sprawling, their canopies interlocking overhead in a
continuous vault of green. Water ran along channels in the deck, fed by
condensation systems that still functioned after two centuries. Animals
moved in the undergrowth — small, quick shapes that might have been
descendants of laboratory specimens or pets or stowaways.

And among the trees, moving with the quiet confidence of people at home,
were human beings.

They were naked, or nearly so — some wore garments of woven plant fiber,
others wore nothing at all. Their skin was pale, adapted to two centuries
of artificial light. They were shorter than Rourke expected, and leaner,
their bodies shaped by generations of slightly-below-Earth gravity and a
diet of whatever the ship's ecosystem provided. They carried tools —
sticks, stones, sharpened pieces of metal that had been scavenged from the
ship's structure and worked into rough blades and scrapers.

They looked at Rourke and his crew with expressions of cautious curiosity.
No fear. No hostility. The calm, appraising gaze of people encountering
something new in an environment that didn't usually produce new things.

"Cap," Malik said quietly. His voice was strange. "They don't know what
we are."

"I know."

"They've been in here for two hundred years. They've never seen anyone
from outside."

"I know."

A man stepped forward from the group. He was older than the others —
forty, perhaps, though it was hard to tell — with a lean, weathered face
and long hair tied back with a strip of fiber. He carried a spear — a
length of metal pipe with a sharpened tip — and he held it loosely, the
way a man holds a tool he knows how to use but does not currently intend
to.

He spoke.

The words were incomprehensible. Not quite — Rourke caught fragments,
syllables that might have been English, or a descendant of English, passed
down through eight generations of oral transmission and shaped by the
acoustic peculiarities of a closed metal environment until it had become
something new. A language. Their language. Born inside this ship, inside
this ecosystem, inside this world that was all the world they knew.

Rourke raised his hands, palms out. Universal gesture. Harmless. The man
with the spear watched him. His eyes were intelligent, wary, calculating.

"Sun," Rourke said. "How many people are on this ship?"

Sun checked her scanner. "Biosigns indicate approximately three hundred
and twelve individuals. Concentrated in this central section, with small
groups in the forward and aft residential blocks."

Three hundred and twelve. The Covenant had launched with eight thousand.
Two hundred years of closed-ecosystem survival had reduced them to three
hundred, and those three hundred had lost their technology, their history,
their connection to the civilization that had built the ship that was
their world.

They had devolved. That was the word that would be used in the reports, the
academic papers, the news stories. Devolved. As if losing the ability to
build computers and read star charts were a step backward rather than an
adaptation — as if these people, who had survived for two centuries in a
sealed metal cylinder with nothing but their wits and whatever the ship's
ecosystem provided, were somehow less than the civilization that had built
the ship and then lost track of it.

Rourke looked at the man with the spear. The man looked back. Between
them lay a gap that was not merely linguistic but civilizational — the
gap between a species that traveled between stars and a tribe that lived
inside a metal forest and did not know that stars existed.

"Malik," Rourke said.

"Yeah, Cap."

"File a contact report with the Colonial Registry. Generation ship
Covenant, located, crew surviving."

"And the salvage claim?"

Rourke was quiet for a long time.

"Hold on that."

                              IV.

They returned to the Magpie. Rourke sat in his command chair and looked
at the Covenant through the viewport and thought about money.

The ship was worth a fortune. Two kilometers of intact hull, functioning
life support, a closed ecosystem that had been running for two centuries —
the scientific value alone was incalculable. The Colonial Registry would
pay a finder's fee. The universities would pay for research access. The
hull, if scrapped, would yield enough refined metals to fund Rourke's
retirement three times over. Under the Salvage Convention, the Covenant
was legally his. No transponder, no registered crew, no contact with the
launching authority. Derelict. Salvageable.

Except for the three hundred and twelve people living inside it.

The Convention was clear on this point — or rather, the Convention was
silent on this point, which was worse. The framers of the Outer Space
Salvage Convention had not anticipated the possibility of a derelict vessel
with a living population that did not know it was on a vessel. The
Convention defined "crew" as "persons registered as crew or passengers with
the vessel's launching authority or its successor." The people on the
Covenant were not registered with anyone. They did not know what a
launching authority was. They did not know they were on a vessel. They did
not know that "outside" existed.

By the letter of the law, they were not crew. They were — what? Occupants?
Inhabitants? Stowaways, eight generations removed? The Convention had no
category for them. The law had no language for what they were.

"I know what you're thinking," Malik said. He was leaning against the
bulkhead, arms crossed, his sharp face unreadable.

"What am I thinking?"

"You're thinking about the Territorial Sovereignty Act. Section Nine.
Indigenous populations."

Rourke looked at him. Malik was smarter than he liked to let on — a
habit of survival in a business where being underestimated was an
advantage.

"The Territorial Sovereignty Act applies to planetary surfaces," Rourke
said. "Not to vessels."

"The people on that ship don't know they're on a vessel. As far as they're
concerned, they're on the only land that exists. They've got a territory,
a population, a social structure, a language. They've got everything that
the Sovereignty Act says constitutes an indigenous claim except a planet
underneath them."

"That's a hell of a legal argument."

"It's the right legal argument."

Rourke rubbed his face. The Covenant hung in the viewport, dark and vast,
a world unto itself. Three hundred and twelve people, living their lives,
raising their children, hunting in the metal forest, speaking their
language, knowing nothing of the universe beyond their hull. They were
happy — or at least they were alive, and functioning, and adapted, which
was more than could be said for most human enterprises.

"If we file a salvage claim," Rourke said, "the Registry sends a
recovery team. They board the ship. They make contact — real contact, not
the ten minutes of mutual staring we just did. They bring translators,
anthropologists, doctors. They assess the population. And then—"

"And then they relocate them. Standard protocol for recovered derelict
populations. Resettle on the nearest colonial world, integrate into
existing society. Give them clothes and shoes and a basic education and
a pat on the head and a nice apartment in a housing block somewhere, and
tell them they should be grateful."

"That's not—"

"That's exactly what happens, Cap, and you know it. Happened to the
Perseverance survivors on Callisto. Happened to the New Dawn remnants
on Vesta. They get resettled, they get 'civilized,' and inside of a
generation they're nobody. Their language dies, their culture dies,
their identity dies. They become — what's the word the social workers
use? — 'integrated.' Absorbed. Gone."

Rourke said nothing. He knew Malik was right. He had seen the resettlement
reports. Populations removed from derelict vessels and deposited in
colonial societies that had no place for them and no patience for the
slow, difficult work of cultural preservation. The survivors adapted, or
they didn't. Their children learned the colonial language and forgot
their parents'. By the third generation, nothing remained but a footnote
in an anthropological paper.

"So what do we do?" Rourke said.

"We have two options. Option one: we file the salvage claim, we get paid,
the Registry takes over, the Covenant people get resettled, and we spend
the rest of our lives not thinking about it."

"And option two?"

Malik uncrossed his arms. He looked at Rourke with the expression of a
man who has been carrying a thought around for several hours and has
decided to set it down.

"Option two: we don't file the claim. We file a discovery report — not
a salvage claim, a discovery report. Different legal category. We report
the existence of the Covenant and its population, and we flag it under
the Territorial Sovereignty Act, Section Nine, and we make the argument
that these people are an indigenous population with a sovereign right to
their territory, even if their territory happens to be a metal cylinder
in deep space."

"That argument has never been made."

"A lot of good arguments have never been made. Doesn't make them wrong."

"And we walk away from the biggest payday of our lives."

Malik's mouth twitched. It might have been a smile, or it might have been
something else.

"Yeah, Cap. We walk away from the biggest payday of our lives."

                              V.

Rourke went back to the Covenant. Alone, this time. He suited up, cycled
through the airlock, walked the overgrown corridors to the central atrium,
and stood among the trees and watched the people who lived there.

They were doing what people do. A group of women sat in a clearing,
weaving fiber into cloth, talking in their strange, evolved language,
their voices carrying the rhythmic cadence of conversation that has
nothing urgent to convey. Children ran through the undergrowth, chasing
each other, laughing — and laughter, Rourke noticed, had not changed in
two hundred years; it was the same sound here as it was in any colony, on
any world, in any civilization. An old man sat against a tree, carving
something from a piece of hull metal with a stone tool, his hands moving
with the patient skill of a craftsman. Two young men sparred with wooden
staves, grinning, showing off for a group of spectators who watched with
the amused tolerance of an audience that has seen this performance before.

The man with the spear appeared. He approached Rourke cautiously, but
without the wariness of their first encounter. He had, apparently, decided
that Rourke was not a threat — or not an immediate one. He stood at a
distance of three meters and regarded Rourke with the frank, appraising
gaze of a man assessing a stranger.

Rourke sat down on the ground. Cross-legged, hands on his knees. Below
eye level. Nonthreatening. The man with the spear watched him, then, after
a moment, sat down as well.

They looked at each other across three meters of deck space that was also
three hundred years of divergent human experience.

Rourke thought about what Malik had said. These people had a territory.
They had a language, a culture, a way of life that had sustained them for
eight generations inside a sealed ecosystem. They did not know about the
stars. They did not know about the colonies. They did not know that the
metal walls of their world were the hull of a ship that had been built by
a civilization they had forgotten, launched toward a destination they
would never reach, and lost in a void they could not imagine.

And they were fine. They were alive, and healthy, and functioning, and
they did not need Rourke or the Registry or the Colonial Authority or
anyone else to tell them how to live. They had figured it out. Eight
generations of figuring it out, in the hardest circumstances imaginable,
and they had arrived at something that worked.

Who was he to take that away from them?

The man with the spear spoke. Rourke did not understand the words, but
he understood the tone — questioning, not aggressive. An inquiry. Who are
you? Why are you here? What do you want?

Good questions. Rourke wished he had answers.

He stood up. He bowed — a gesture that he hoped was universal enough to
convey respect, though he had no way of knowing what it meant in the
Covenant's culture. The man with the spear watched him. Then, slowly,
he inclined his head in return.

Rourke walked back to the airlock. Behind him, the forest of the
Covenant rustled with the sounds of people living, and he thought about
how strange it was that the greatest salvage find of his career was the
one thing he could not, in conscience, salvage.

                              VI.

He filed the report from the Magpie's communication console, Malik at
his shoulder, Sun monitoring the transmission to make sure it went out
clean and uninterrupted.

DISCOVERY REPORT — NOT A SALVAGE CLAIM

TO: Colonial Registry, Outer Space Administration
FROM: Captain Edward Rourke, Salvage Vessel Magpie, Registration TCS-4471
RE: Generation Ship Covenant, located Deep Reach Sector 7, coordinates
appended

Be advised: the generation ship Covenant, launched 2043, declared lost
2115, has been located intact at the coordinates specified. The vessel is
structurally sound with functioning life support and a closed ecosystem.

The vessel is occupied by approximately 312 human beings, descendants of
the original colonists, who have developed an independent culture and
language over approximately eight generations of isolated habitation. This
population has no contact with or knowledge of external human civilization.

This report is filed as a discovery, not a salvage claim. The undersigned
asserts that the population of the Covenant constitutes an indigenous
community with sovereign rights to their territory under the Territorial
Sovereignty Act, Section 9, and requests that the Colonial Registry
recognize this status and refrain from involuntary relocation or
resettlement of the Covenant population.

The undersigned further recommends that any contact with the Covenant
population be conducted under protocols consistent with the treatment of
contacted indigenous peoples, including but not limited to: informed
consent, cultural preservation, and the right of self-determination.

The Covenant is someone's home. Treat it accordingly.

— Capt. Edward Rourke

He sent it. The transmission light blinked green. The message hurtled
into the void at the speed of light, carrying a legal argument that had
never been made and a moral argument that should not have needed making.

"Well," Malik said. "There goes the biggest payday of our lives."

"Yep."

"Feel good about it?"

Rourke looked at the Covenant through the viewport. Dark, vast, alive.
A world. The only world that three hundred and twelve people had ever
known.

"I feel broke," Rourke said. "But I feel honest."

Malik clapped him on the shoulder. "Honest is good. Honest doesn't pay
the fuel bill, but it's good."

"We'll find another wreck."

"Always do, Cap. Always do."

The Magpie pulled away from the Covenant. Rourke watched the great ship
dwindle in the viewport — a dark shape against the stars, a metal forest
drifting in the void, a home. Behind its hull, in its overgrown corridors
and its wild central atrium, three hundred and twelve people went about
their lives, unaware that they had just been found and, for now at least,
left alone.

The stars were thick in the viewport. The Deep Reach stretched out in
every direction, vast and dark and full of junk and treasure and the
ruins of human ambition.

"Where to?" Malik asked.

Rourke turned the Magpie's nose toward the next sector. There was always
more salvage out there. Always more wreckage, more debris, more forgotten
things waiting to be found. The business went on.

But behind them, growing smaller in the dark, the Covenant drifted. And
inside it, people lived. And that, Rourke thought, was worth more than
anything he could haul to port.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        FOREWORD

Dear Citizen,

Congratulations on acquiring this Guide. Whether you have received it as
part of your standard civic orientation (Form 7-C, "Welcome to Adulthood
in the Monitored Society"), as a helpful supplement to your quarterly
Contentment Assessment, or as a gentle recommendation from your assigned
Harmony Liaison, we are delighted to welcome you to the community of
informed, cooperative, and demonstrably cheerful citizens who have
discovered that life under comprehensive observation is not merely
tolerable but positively enjoyable.

We understand that some citizens, particularly those who recall the
Transition Period (2038-2044), may harbour residual discomfort regarding
the Surveillance Mandate. This is entirely natural. Change, even change
for the better, can be unsettling, and the Bureau of Public Harmony
wishes to assure you that your discomfort has been noted (it has, of
course, been noted — this is rather the point) and that this Guide has
been designed to address your concerns in a spirit of warmth, helpfulness,
and firm but compassionate clarity.

Let us begin.

                    CHAPTER ONE
            Understanding Your Observation Environment

The modern citizen of the United Territories enjoys the most comprehensive
personal observation system in human history. This is a source of pride,
not anxiety. The Integrated Monitoring Network (IMN) comprises the
following elements, each designed with your safety and well-being in mind:

   1. OPTICAL SURVEILLANCE: High-definition cameras are installed in all
      public spaces, all commercial premises, all transportation vehicles,
      all educational institutions, and all residential dwellings. The
      residential camera programme, introduced in 2047, provides coverage
      of all rooms except the lavatory (a concession to modesty that the
      Bureau regards as one of its most generous gestures — please see
      Chapter Four, "Gratitude as a Daily Practice"). Citizens who wish
      to express appreciation for the lavatory exemption may do so by
      filing Form 12-A ("Expression of Gratitude for Monitored Privacy
      Concession") at their local Harmony Office.

   2. AUDITORY SURVEILLANCE: Microphone arrays, synchronised with the
      optical system, provide continuous audio monitoring in all spaces
      covered by cameras. The system's voice-recognition capability
      allows for real-time transcription and analysis of all conversations.
      Citizens are reminded that whispering, while not illegal, is flagged
      by the system as "anomalous vocal behaviour" and may trigger a
      routine inquiry (Form 19-B, "Explanation of Anomalous Vocal
      Behaviour"). We recommend speaking at a natural volume at all times.

   3. BIOMETRIC MONITORING: All citizens are fitted, at birth, with a
      subcutaneous monitoring implant (the "Harmony Chip") that tracks
      heart rate, blood pressure, cortisol levels, and a proprietary
      index of neurological activity that the Bureau refers to as the
      "Contentment Quotient" (CQ). Your CQ is updated every thirty
      seconds and transmitted to the Central Harmony Database, where it
      is reviewed by trained analysts and, where necessary, by automated
      concern-detection algorithms. A sustained drop in CQ below the
      mandated threshold (currently 7.2 on the Bureau's ten-point scale)
      will result in a welfare visit from your Harmony Liaison. This is
      for your benefit. Please welcome them warmly.

   4. DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE: All electronic communications, including but
      not limited to telephone calls, electronic mail, text messages,
      and internet browsing activity, are monitored, recorded, and
      archived by the Bureau's Digital Harmony Division. Citizens are
      reminded that the use of encryption technology is classified as a
      Category Two Social Harmony Offence, punishable by mandatory
      attendance at a Bureau Re-Alignment Seminar (duration: varies).

This may seem, to the uninitiated, rather a lot of surveillance. The
Bureau understands this reaction and wishes to address it directly: it
is, indeed, a lot of surveillance. That is the point. Comprehensive
observation eliminates the anxiety of uncertainty. You need never wonder
whether you are being watched, because you are always being watched. This
constancy is, we submit, a form of freedom — the freedom from doubt, the
freedom from the exhausting effort of maintaining a private self that no
one will ever see, the freedom to be, at all times and in all places,
exactly and entirely the person you appear to be.

We call this Transparent Living, and it is, we assure you, wonderful.

                    CHAPTER TWO
             The Art of the Monitored Smile

Research conducted by the Bureau's Department of Facial Expression Analysis
has established that smiling is the single most effective indicator of
social contentment, and that citizens who smile frequently are twenty-three
percent less likely to be flagged for a welfare inquiry than citizens who
do not. Smiling is therefore not merely a pleasant habit but a civic
responsibility, and the Bureau encourages all citizens to cultivate what
we call the "Harmony Smile" — a warm, natural-looking expression of
well-being that can be maintained comfortably for extended periods.

The following guidelines will assist you in developing your Harmony Smile:

   a. FREQUENCY: The Bureau recommends smiling for a minimum of sixty
      percent of waking hours. This figure is based on extensive research
      into the smiling habits of citizens rated "Highly Content" on their
      most recent Contentment Assessment, and it represents the threshold
      below which automated systems may register a concern.

   b. AUTHENTICITY: The Bureau's facial analysis algorithms are
      sophisticated enough to distinguish between genuine smiles (which
      engage the orbicularis oculi muscles around the eyes) and forced
      smiles (which engage only the zygomaticus major muscles of the
      mouth). Citizens are therefore advised to cultivate genuinely
      positive emotions rather than merely simulating them. Techniques
      for generating authentic positive affect are covered in Chapter
      Three, "Thinking Happy Thoughts: A Practical Guide."

   c. CONTEXTUAL APPROPRIATENESS: While smiling is generally encouraged,
      there are circumstances in which excessive smiling may be flagged
      as anomalous. These include: attendance at a funeral (a subdued,
      sympathetic smile is appropriate; a broad grin is not), receiving
      news of a national emergency (a brave, resolute smile is
      appropriate; laughter is not), and during a Bureau interview
      (a cooperative, open smile is appropriate; a fixed, unblinking
      smile may be interpreted as mockery). When in doubt, consult
      the Bureau's "Smile Appropriateness Matrix," available at all
      Harmony Offices and downloadable from the Bureau's public
      information portal.

   d. SLEEP: Citizens are not expected to smile while sleeping.
      However, the Bureau notes that citizens who report happy dreams
      on their morning Contentment Survey (Form 3-D, "How Did You
      Sleep? A Mandatory Self-Report") tend to score higher on their
      daytime CQ readings. The Bureau does not, at present, monitor
      dreams directly, though research in this area is ongoing.

                    CHAPTER THREE
          Thinking Happy Thoughts: A Practical Guide

The Bureau recognises that authentic contentment cannot be achieved
through facial expression alone. True happiness — the deep, abiding
satisfaction that the Bureau defines as "harmonious integration with the
monitored community" — must originate in the mind. To this end, the
Bureau has developed a programme of Approved Thought Patterns (ATPs)
designed to guide the citizen's inner life toward maximum contentment.

The following ATPs are recommended for daily practice:

   ATP-1: "I am grateful for the protection of the Monitoring Network."
   This thought should be practised upon waking, upon arriving at one's
   place of employment, and upon returning home in the evening. Gratitude,
   the Bureau has determined, is the foundation of contentment. A citizen
   who is grateful for being observed is a citizen who has nothing to hide,
   and a citizen who has nothing to hide is a citizen who is free.

   ATP-2: "My well-being is the Bureau's highest priority."
   This thought should be practised whenever the citizen feels a momentary
   doubt about the purpose or necessity of the Monitoring Network. Such
   doubts are natural — the Bureau has extensive data on their frequency,
   duration, and neurological correlates — and the recommended response
   is to replace the doubt with the reassuring certainty that the Bureau's
   sole function is to ensure the citizen's happiness. (Citizens who
   experience persistent doubt despite regular ATP practice should report
   to their Harmony Liaison for a Supplementary Contentment Consultation.
   This is not a punishment. It is an opportunity.)

   ATP-3: "I have nothing to fear because I have nothing to conceal."
   This thought — arguably the most important of the approved patterns —
   should be practised whenever the citizen becomes aware of being
   observed, which is to say, at all times. The logic is straightforward:
   surveillance threatens only those who have something to hide; the
   citizen who lives transparently has no reason for discomfort. Any
   discomfort that persists despite this logic should be reported on
   Form 8-F ("Unexplained Discomfort in the Presence of Monitoring
   Equipment") and will be investigated by a trained professional.

   ATP-4: "Comparison is the enemy of contentment."
   Citizens are reminded that comparing their current circumstances to
   historical periods of lesser surveillance is both unhelpful and
   inaccurate. The Pre-Monitoring Era (prior to 2038) was characterised
   by high crime rates, social fragmentation, and widespread anxiety —
   conditions that the Monitoring Network has effectively eliminated.
   Citizens who romanticise the Pre-Monitoring Era are encouraged to
   review the Bureau's educational materials, particularly the pamphlet
   "Remember How Terrible It Was? A Statistical Comparison" (available
   at all Harmony Offices).

                    CHAPTER FOUR
              Gratitude as a Daily Practice

The Bureau considers gratitude to be the highest civic virtue. A grateful
citizen is a content citizen, and a content citizen is a cooperative
citizen, and a cooperative citizen is a citizen who does not generate
unnecessary work for the Bureau's overstretched staff. (We say this with
affection. The Bureau's staff are dedicated public servants who work long
hours in the service of your happiness, and they appreciate your
cooperation more than you know. Or, more precisely, exactly as much as
you know, since your cooperation is monitored and quantified.)

The Bureau has identified the following occasions for the formal
expression of gratitude:

   — Upon receiving a welfare visit from one's Harmony Liaison.
     (Recommended response: "Thank you for checking on me. I am fine.
     Would you like tea?")

   — Upon being informed that one's Contentment Quotient has dropped
     below the mandated threshold. (Recommended response: "Thank you
     for bringing this to my attention. I will endeavour to improve.")

   — Upon completing a Bureau Re-Alignment Seminar. (Recommended
     response: "Thank you for helping me understand. I feel much
     better now.")

   — Upon receiving notification that one's electronic communications
     have been reviewed as part of a routine audit. (Recommended
     response: "Thank you for your thoroughness. I hope everything
     was in order.")

   — Upon any occasion whatsoever. Gratitude is always appropriate.
     It is never too much. It is the oil in the machinery of the
     monitored society, and without it, the machinery — well, the
     machinery would still function perfectly well, because it is
     very good machinery. But it would function less pleasantly. And
     pleasantness is, after all, the goal.

                    CHAPTER FIVE
            A Brief Note on Non-Compliance

The Bureau prefers not to discuss non-compliance. Non-compliance is
unpleasant, and this Guide is dedicated to pleasantness. However, in the
interest of completeness, the Bureau acknowledges that a very small number
of citizens — a statistically negligible minority, well within the
expected parameters of any large population — occasionally exhibit
behaviours that fall outside the Bureau's guidelines for harmonious
civic participation.

These behaviours include, but are not limited to:

   — Failure to maintain the recommended minimum smiling frequency.
   — Sustained Contentment Quotient readings below the mandated
     threshold despite Liaison intervention.
   — Use of encrypted communications technology.
   — Attempted obstruction of monitoring equipment (covering cameras,
     disabling microphones, tampering with one's Harmony Chip — the
     Bureau notes, with measured disappointment, that some citizens
     have attempted the latter, and wishes to remind the public that
     the Harmony Chip is designed to be tamper-evident, and that
     attempts to disable or remove it are detected immediately and
     classified as a Category One Social Harmony Offence).
   — Organisation of, or participation in, unauthorised gatherings
     for the purpose of discussing alternatives to the Monitoring
     Network. (The Bureau notes, with somewhat less measured
     disappointment, that such gatherings occur more frequently than
     official statistics suggest, and wishes to remind the public that
     the monitoring of such gatherings is the very thing that makes
     them unnecessary.)

Citizens who engage in these behaviours are, in the first instance,
offered support. The Bureau's approach is compassionate. The Harmony
Liaison will visit. Supplementary Contentment Consultations will be
scheduled. Approved Thought Patterns will be reviewed and reinforced.
The citizen will be given every opportunity to return to a state of
harmonious participation.

In the second instance, the citizen will be invited to attend a
Re-Alignment Seminar. These seminars, held at Bureau facilities
throughout the United Territories, are intensive programmes of civic
education, counselling, and structured reflection, lasting between
two weeks and — in rare cases — several months. They are conducted in
comfortable surroundings by dedicated professionals, and their success
rate is extremely high. Almost all citizens who complete a Re-Alignment
Seminar return to their communities as enthusiastic participants in the
monitored society. The Bureau is very proud of this success rate.

In the third instance — the very rare third instance — the citizen will
be referred to the Ministry of Social Cohesion's Department of Extended
Civic Support, whose programmes and methods are beyond the scope of
this Guide. The Bureau wishes to assure all citizens that referral to the
Department of Extended Civic Support is extraordinarily uncommon, and that
the overwhelming majority of citizens will never encounter it, and that
those who do encounter it are treated with the same compassion and
dedication to well-being that characterises all Bureau interactions.

The Bureau does not discuss the Department of Extended Civic Support in
further detail. This is not because the Department's activities are
secret — nothing is secret in the monitored society, which is rather
the point — but because detailed discussion of the Department's
programmes has been found, in Bureau research, to produce a temporary
reduction in Contentment Quotient readings among citizens who encounter
the information. The Bureau's primary obligation is to your happiness,
and detailed information about the Department of Extended Civic Support
does not, on balance, contribute to happiness.

You do not need to know more. You need to know that you are safe, and
watched, and cared for, and that the Bureau's sole purpose is your
well-being.

Smile. You are home.

                    AFTERWORD

The Bureau of Public Harmony hopes that this Guide has been helpful. We
recognise that the monitored life requires adjustment, and we admire
your willingness to engage with the process. You are a good citizen. The
Bureau knows this, because the Bureau knows everything about you, and
what it knows is — on the whole, in the aggregate, allowing for the
occasional minor deviation from optimal civic behaviour — reassuring.

You are watched. You are measured. You are known. And in being known,
you are — we promise you — loved.

Not by any individual, of course. The Bureau does not traffic in anything
so inefficient as individual affection. But by the system. By the network.
By the vast, patient, comprehensive apparatus of observation that holds
you in its gaze from the moment of your birth to the moment of your death
and that wants, with a sincerity that no individual could match, for you
to be happy.

Be happy. It is, after all, mandatory.

With warmest regards and continuous observation,

The Bureau of Public Harmony
Ministry of Social Cohesion
United Territories of Greater Britain

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

HAROLD "HAL" MERCER returns to these pages after a three-year absence with
his most ambitious and most personal story to date. Mercer, a civil
engineer by profession who has spent twenty-two years building highway
interchanges for the State of Ohio, brings his characteristic technical
authority to "Bridge to Everywhere," but long-time readers will notice
something new in his work: a concern for the human cost of great
engineering that goes beyond the structural to the political. When we asked
what had changed, he replied: "I was driving past a construction site last
year and realized I knew everything about the bridge being built and
nothing about the men building it. That bothered me." He lives in Akron
with his wife Dorothy and their four sons.

CASSANDRA VOSS makes her second appearance in these pages with "The
Cartographer's Confession," following her acclaimed debut "The Attache's
Dilemma" in our May issue. Voss is a former political analyst with the
State Department who turned to science fiction because, as she puts it,
"the real world has no room for the kind of political imagination that
fiction permits." Her story of maps and empires and the unintended
consequences of righteous action is, in our judgment, one of the finest
political SF stories we have ever published. She lives in Georgetown and
gives interviews reluctantly.

MARGARET THORNTON needs no introduction to readers of this magazine. Her
work has appeared in these pages since our earliest issues, and "Pollen
Count" represents a new direction for her: ecological SF that asks not
what we do to nature but what nature does to us. Thornton holds a master's
degree in marine biology from the University of Washington and lives on
Orcas Island in the San Juan archipelago, where she studies tide pools,
writes stories, and thinks long thoughts about the relationship between
human ambition and ecological equilibrium. She describes "Pollen Count"
as "the story I've been trying to write for ten years."

FRANKLIN HOYT has been writing political science fiction for this magazine
since 1954, and "Blueprints for a Better Bomb" may be his most important
story yet. A former journalist who covered Congress and the early Cold War,
Hoyt brings a reporter's eye for institutional detail and a moralist's
clarity to his tale of a weapons designer confronting the implications of
his own work. "Every physicist who has ever designed a weapon has had this
conversation with himself," Hoyt told us. "I just wrote it down." He
lives in Washington, D.C., with his wife Barbara, a constitutional law
professor, and their three children.

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a physicist, a writer, and the most rigorously
scientific imagination in our pages. His "Resonance Engine" represents a
departure from his usual territory of orbital mechanics and astrophysics
into the deeper waters of cosmology and metaphysics. "I wanted to write
about a scientist who discovers something that science cannot explain," he
said, "and who must decide what to do with the discovery. The answer, I
think, is the same as it always is: you keep looking." He holds a
research position at Caltech and has published over sixty peer-reviewed
papers in astrophysics, though he insists that his fiction is "the more
honest work."

REX DRUMMOND is the writer you turn to when you want a story that grabs
you by the collar and doesn't let go, and "Salvage Rights" is vintage
Drummond — fast-paced, vivid, and populated by the kind of tough, decent
characters who make you believe that decency might survive the frontier.
But long-time readers will notice something new here as well: a moral
complexity that Drummond himself attributes to "getting older and thinking
harder." A former bomber pilot and all-purpose Texas adventurer, Drummond
lives in San Diego, where he writes at night, argues about politics at
convention bars, and insists that his best story is always the next one.

DOUGLAS PEMBERTON is the funniest writer in science fiction, and "Smile
Under Surveillance" is, in our estimation, his most brilliantly unsettling
work. Written in the form of a government manual for citizens of a
surveillance state, the story achieves its devastating effect through the
deadpan earnestness of its bureaucratic prose — a prose so perfectly
calibrated that the horror creeps up on you disguised as helpful advice.
Pemberton, a former humor columnist and graduate of Oxford, lives in
Woking, Surrey, with his wife Penelope, three dogs, and a parrot that
can recite the opening of "The War of the Worlds." He describes "Smile
Under Surveillance" as "the least funny thing I've ever written, which
means it's probably the best."

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling and Miss Foxworth,

Cassandra Voss's "The Attache's Dilemma" in the May issue is the most
intelligent piece of political science fiction I have read since Le Guin's
"The Left Hand of Darkness." Finally, someone who understands that the
future will not be governed by ray guns but by trade agreements and the
people who negotiate them. I demand more from Miss Voss, and I demand it
at once.

                              — Dr. Patricia Albrecht
                                 Department of Political Science
                                 Columbia University, New York

Dear Editors,

I have been reading this magazine since 1953, and I wish to register a
complaint. The new contributors — Voss, St. Croix, and the rest — write
beautifully, but where are the rivets? Where are the engineering details?
Where are the stories about men who build things? I miss the old days,
when a story in these pages came with enough technical specifications
to keep a model builder busy for a week. More Mercer, please. More
Koslov. Fewer feelings, more physics.

                              — George Winslow
                                 Dayton, Ohio

Mr. Winslow, you are in luck: this issue features both Mercer and Koslov,
along with a healthy complement of rivets, physics, and feelings. We
decline to choose between them.                         — M.S. & D.F.

Dear Maxwell and Diana,

Franklin Hoyt's "The Profit Motive" in the March issue left me shaking.
That man sees the future more clearly than any writer working today, and
what he sees is terrifying. I have shared the story with three members
of my congressional staff, and I intend to share it with three more. Keep
publishing Hoyt. The country needs him even if the country doesn't know it.

                                 Washington, D.C.

Dear Sir or Madam Editors,

Regarding Dr. Koslov's "The Quiet After Cascade" in the January issue:
the orbital decay calculations in Section III are incorrect. The station's
orbit, as described, would decay in approximately forty-seven days, not
the eighty-one days stated in the text. I have appended my calculations
for your review. I trust Dr. Koslov will wish to be informed. The story
was, I concede, otherwise excellent, but accuracy is accuracy.

                              — Dr. Howard Fitch
                                 Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona

Dr. Fitch has been correcting our contributors' mathematics since Issue
#1 and has never once been wrong. We have forwarded his calculations to
Dr. Koslov, who, we suspect, already knows.          — M.S. & D.F.

Dear Editors,

I am a welder on a construction project in Chicago, and I want to tell you
that your magazine is the only thing I read that makes me feel like my
work matters. The stories about people who build things — Mercer's
especially — they get it right. Not just the technical stuff, but the
feeling of it. The pride and the exhaustion and the way you look at
something you built and know that it will be there after you're gone.
Thank you for that.

                              — Frank Kowalski
                                 Chicago, Illinois

Mr. Kowalski, this issue's lead story is for you.      — M.S. & D.F.

THE MAN IN THE HIGH CASTLE by Philip K. Dick
(Putnam, 1962, $4.50)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Dick has given us a novel that defies easy categorization and rewards
repeated reading. In an alternate history where the Axis powers won the
Second World War, the western United States is occupied by Japan and the
eastern states by Germany, and an underground novel-within-the-novel
imagines a world where the Allies won — which is, of course, our world,
though Mr. Dick is far too clever to make the correspondence exact. The
result is a layered, disorienting meditation on reality, history, and the
stories we tell ourselves about who won and what winning means. The prose
is spare, the characterization precise, and the philosophical undertow
powerful enough to pull you under. This is science fiction as literature,
and literature as moral inquiry. Essential reading.

A WRINKLE IN TIME by Madeleine L'Engle
(Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1962, $3.25)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mrs. L'Engle has written a children's book that is not, in any meaningful
sense, merely for children. Meg Murry's journey through space and time to
rescue her father from a malevolent intelligence is at once a cosmic
adventure, a meditation on the nature of evil, and a love letter to the
power of individual will against conformity. The science is metaphorical
rather than rigorous — the "tesseract" that enables interstellar travel
is more theology than physics — but the emotional truth is absolute. I
read it in a single sitting and immediately read it again. Mrs. L'Engle
understands something that too many science fiction writers forget: that
the universe is strange, and dangerous, and beautiful, and that the
appropriate response to all three is courage.

CAT'S CRADLE by Kurt Vonnegut
(Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1963, $3.95)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Vonnegut writes with the cheerful despair of a man who has looked
at the human race and decided to laugh rather than weep, and "Cat's
Cradle" is his funniest and most devastating performance. The novel
follows a writer researching the inventor of the atomic bomb and leads
him to a Caribbean island, a new religion, and a substance called Ice-Nine
that can freeze all the water on Earth. It is hilarious. It is also a
horror story about the relationship between science and destruction that
Franklin Hoyt's readers will find uncomfortably familiar. Mr. Vonnegut
is not usually classified as a science fiction writer, and he would
probably resent the label, but we claim him anyway. He is one of us,
whether he likes it or not.

                       COMING ATTRACTIONS
         In the Next Issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #53 — September 1964

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue, which will
be available at newsstands in late August:

"THE CARTOGRAPHY OF ABSENCE" by Julian St. Croix — A cartographer aboard
a generation ship discovers that the ship's maps are being subtly altered
by an unknown force. St. Croix's debut in these pages, and a story that
will divide our readership — which is, we suspect, exactly what he intends.

"THE EMPATHY ENGINE" by Arthur Wainwright — An AI designed to simulate
human emotion for therapeutic purposes begins experiencing what appears to
be genuine suffering. Wainwright's most ambitious exploration of machine
consciousness yet.

"FIRE SEASON" by Margaret Thornton — On a terraformed world, an ecologist
discovers that the planet's introduced forest requires periodic wildfire
to maintain its health — and that the colony's fire-suppression policy is
slowly killing the ecosystem it was meant to protect.

"DEADLOCK AT DORADO" by Rex Drummond — Two salvage crews claim the same
derelict, and neither is willing to back down. Drummond at his
competitive, propulsive best.

Plus: a new story by Phyllis Crenshaw, letters from our readers, book
reviews, and more.
