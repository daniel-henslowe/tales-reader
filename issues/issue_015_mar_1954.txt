TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

There is something deeply human about the act of building. Long before we
had language for it, before we had philosophy or science or even religion,
we had the impulse to take raw materials and shape them into something
that had not existed before. A wall. A bridge. A shelter against the
dark. To build is to assert, in the most fundamental way possible, that
the future matters -- that it is worth preparing for.

And yet every act of building contains within it the seed of its own
undoing. The wall crumbles. The bridge rusts. The shelter is swept away
by wind or water or time or the simple accumulated weight of human
neglect. Construction and destruction are not opposites; they are dance
partners, each one giving meaning to the other.

This issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond is, in a sense, about that
dance. Harold Mercer opens our pages with the first installment of what
promises to be his most ambitious project yet: "The Dyson Initiative," a
tale of construction on a scale that beggars the imagination -- nothing
less than the enclosure of our own Sun. It is engineering fiction at its
finest, and I suspect Mercer's readers will find it worth the wait.
Franklin Hoyt, whose devastating debut "The Committee" appeared in our
last issue, returns with "Obedience Index," a story about a different
kind of construction -- the building of a surveillance state so thorough
that it can measure the loyalty inside your skull. I will say only that
it is the most provocative story we have published to date, and that the
letters it generates will, I suspect, fill several future issues.

Rex Drummond takes us to the ocean floor of Europa -- a sentence I take
considerable pleasure in writing -- for "Treasure of the Sunken Fleet,"
an adventure that begins as salvage and ends as something considerably
more alarming. Oscar Lennox contributes "Forking Paths," a
meditation on history, possibility, and the dangerous allure of the road
not taken. Theodore Cain, our most reliable contributor and the man I
privately think of as the backbone of this magazine, delivers "Sandcastle
Empires," a story of unexpected tenderness about a child who builds
something extraordinary on a world where nothing lasts. And Agnes
Whitfield, whose spare and luminous "After the Sirens" remains one of
our most discussed stories, returns with "Beneath the Rust," a tale of
discovery in the ruins of a world that built too much and maintained too
little.

Six stories. Six meditations on what we build, what we destroy, and what
endures when both the builders and the wreckers have gone home.

I am enormously proud of this issue. I hope you will find it worth the
thirty-five cents.

Yours among the stars,

                       THE DYSON INITIATIVE

                              Part I

                    by Harold "Hal" Mercer

================================================================================

                               I.

The swarm started with a single collector.

Yuki Tanaka stood in the observation gallery of Helios Station and
watched it deploy: a hexagonal sheet of solar-reflective composite, four
hundred meters across, unfolding from its launch cradle like an origami
crane straightening its wings. At this distance -- nine hundred thousand
kilometers from the Sun's photosphere -- the collector was a dark speck
against an ocean of light. But Tanaka could see it on the display board
behind her, rendered in clean blue lines against a black grid, its
telemetry scrolling in real-time down the right side of the screen.

Mass: 4,200 metric tons. Reflective surface area: 138,400 square meters.
Orientation: nominal. Thermal gradient: within tolerances.

One collector. The first of nineteen billion.

She pressed her palms flat against the gallery's radiation-shielded
glass and felt the warmth of the Sun through a meter of composite
layering and electromagnetic baffling. The light out here was not the
golden, diffuse light of Earth. It was white and absolute, a physical
force that pressed against the station's hull with measurable radiation
pressure. Her engineers called it "the Push." In the inner solar system,
the Sun did not illuminate. It insisted.

"Collector One is nominal," said Martin Gruber, her chief deployment
officer, from the communications panel behind her. His voice had the
flat, careful tone of a man reading numbers he had checked three times.
"Attitude stable. Power generation at one hundred and four percent of
projected baseline."

"Four percent over?"

"Solar output is running slightly above the mean this cycle. Nothing
outside the design envelope."

Tanaka nodded. Four percent over baseline on a single collector was a
rounding error. Four percent over baseline on nineteen billion collectors
was enough energy to power every human settlement in the solar system
twice over. The margins mattered at scale. Everything mattered at scale.

That was the first lesson she had learned as a structural engineer, and
it was the lesson that governed every waking hour of her life now: the
Dyson Initiative was a project where the difference between success and
catastrophe could be measured in decimal places.

She turned from the window and walked to the central planning table,
where the holographic display showed the Sun as a pale yellow sphere
surrounded by a ghostly lattice of projected collector positions. The
lattice was beautiful in the abstract -- a geodesic grid of interlocking
hexagons, each one representing the orbital slot for a single collector,
the whole structure forming a partial sphere that would eventually
intercept thirty-seven percent of the Sun's total energy output. Not a
solid shell -- Freeman Dyson himself had noted, in his original 1960
paper, that a rigid sphere around a star was mechanically impossible. The
Initiative called for a swarm: billions of independent collectors
orbiting in coordinated formation, each one a free-flying unit
maintaining its position through ion thrusters and gravitational
balancing.

It was the largest engineering project in human history. The largest
engineering project that could be conceived, short of disassembling a
planet for raw materials -- which, Tanaka reflected, was also on the
project timeline, though not until Phase IV.

"Where are we on the Mercury extraction schedule?" she asked.

Gruber pulled up a secondary display. "Sato's team has the first strip
mine operational at Caloris Basin. Current output is six hundred tons of
refined silicon per day. They're projecting full capacity -- twelve
thousand tons per day -- by the end of the fiscal quarter."

"And the fabrication plant?"

"Orbital Fab One is running test batches. First production-quality
collectors are scheduled for next month. Fab Two is still under
construction -- they're behind schedule on the smelting modules."

"How far behind?"

"Three weeks."

Tanaka pulled up the master schedule on her personal display and studied
it. The Dyson Initiative had a fifty-year construction timeline, broken
into six phases. They were fourteen months into Phase I, which called for
the deployment of the first fifty thousand collectors -- a proof of
concept that would demonstrate the swarm's orbital stability and energy
capture efficiency. If Phase I succeeded, the General Assembly of the
Solar Confederation would vote on full funding for Phases II through VI.
If it failed, the project would be shelved, and the most ambitious thing
humanity had ever attempted would become a footnote in the history of
engineering.

Three weeks behind on a fifty-year project should not have worried her.
But Tanaka had spent twenty years building things in space, from the
Lagrange habitats to the Martian rail system, and she had learned that
delays propagated. A three-week delay on smelting modules became a six-
week delay on fabrication output, which became a twelve-week delay on
collector deployment, which meant they would miss their Phase I deadline,
which meant the funding vote would slip, which meant the political
opposition would have more time to organize.

And the political opposition was already organizing.

                               * * *

The message from Governor Elaine Vasquez of the Mercurian Administrative
District arrived at 14:00 station time, flagged priority-urgent, and
Tanaka read it standing at her desk with a cup of cold coffee in her
hand.

It was politely worded, as Vasquez's communications always were. The
Governor expressed her continued support for the Dyson Initiative and
her admiration for the engineering team's achievements. She noted that
the people of Mercury had always been proud to host humanity's most
ambitious projects and that the extraction operations at Caloris Basin
represented a welcome economic stimulus for the district.

However.

There was always a however.

Governor Vasquez wished to bring to the Chief Architect's attention
certain concerns that had been raised by the Mercurian Citizens'
Council. Specifically, the Council had commissioned an independent study
on the projected reduction in solar irradiance at Mercury's surface as
the collector swarm reached full deployment. The study's preliminary
findings indicated that a thirty-seven percent reduction in solar flux
would lower Mercury's mean surface temperature by approximately one
hundred and twenty degrees Kelvin, with significant implications for the
thermal power generation systems that provided sixty percent of the
district's energy.

In short: if you build a sunshade around the Sun, Mercury gets cold.

Tanaka set down her coffee. She had anticipated this objection. It was
in the environmental impact assessment, volume four, section twelve,
subsection C. The temperature reduction was real but manageable. Mercury
had no biosphere to disrupt. Its thermal power systems could be
supplemented -- indeed, replaced -- by direct energy feeds from the
collector swarm itself. Mercury would receive more energy from the Dyson
swarm than it currently received from raw sunlight, delivered in a more
controlled and useful form.

But the politics were not about energy. The politics were about
autonomy. Mercury was the smallest and most isolated of the inner
system's administrative districts, perpetually overshadowed by Mars
and the Jovian settlements, and its population of eight hundred thousand
had developed the fierce independence common to small communities in
harsh environments. They did not want to be dependent on the Dyson
swarm for their energy. They did not want a project designed and managed
by people from Earth and Mars to determine their climate. They did not
want to be told that the most visible feature of their sky -- the Sun
itself -- was being remodeled for someone else's benefit.

Tanaka understood all of this. She was the daughter of engineers who had
built bridges in Hokkaido, and she had grown up listening to her father
talk about the communities that fought highway projects because the
highway would change the character of their town, even when the highway
would also bring jobs and commerce and connection to the larger world.
Her father had been patient with those communities. He had sat in town
halls and listened to their concerns and modified his designs where he
could and explained, calmly and clearly, where he could not. And
sometimes the highway got built, and sometimes it didn't.

The difference was that her father's highways served a region. The Dyson
Initiative served the species.

She opened a reply window and began to type.

                               II.

The Engineering Council met every Tuesday at 09:00 in the main
conference room of Helios Station, which the staff called the Furnace
because its eastern wall was a floor-to-ceiling viewport that faced the
Sun. Tanaka had considered having the viewport polarized during meetings,
but she had decided against it. The Sun was the project. It should be in
the room.

Today's meeting had twelve items on the agenda. Tanaka made it through
the first three -- deployment statistics, fabrication output, propellant
reserves -- before the real subject of the morning asserted itself.

"We need to talk about the Venusian delegation," said Reza Amiri, her
chief political liaison. Amiri was a compact, olive-skinned man with a
diplomat's smile and an engineer's impatience. He had spent ten years in
the Solar Confederation's Ministry of Infrastructure before Tanaka had
recruited him, and he understood both the technical and political
dimensions of the Initiative better than anyone on her staff.

"What about them?"

"They've formally requested a presentation on the projected impact of
the swarm on Venus's solar irradiance. Specifically, they want to know
how the collector deployment sequence will affect the Venusian
terraforming schedule."

Tanaka looked at him. "The deployment sequence is designed to minimize
impact on the inner planets during Phase I. They know that."

"They know it intellectually. They want to see the numbers presented
by us, in person, to their Terraforming Authority board. They want us
on the record."

"This is about Vasquez."

Amiri nodded. "Mercury's concerns are making waves. Venus doesn't share
Mercury's objections -- they're actually net beneficiaries of the swarm,
since the energy feeds will accelerate their atmospheric processing by a
factor of three. But they don't want to be seen as rubber-stamping a
project that their neighbors are questioning. They need political cover."

"So we give them a presentation."

"We give them a presentation," Amiri agreed. "And while we're at it, we
should probably start thinking about Mars. The Tharsis delegation has
been quiet, but quiet doesn't mean happy."

Tanaka rubbed her eyes. She had been up since 04:00, reviewing the
thermal stress data on the Fab Two smelting modules, and the political
maneuvering felt like a language she could read but not speak natively.
She thought in terms of load tolerances and material specifications.
Amiri thought in terms of constituencies and leverage. She needed him,
and she knew it, and it irritated her slightly.

"What does Mars want?" she asked.

"Mars wants what Mars always wants. Assurance that they won't be
disadvantaged relative to the Jovians. If the swarm's energy output
is distributed on a per-capita basis, the outer colonies get more per
person because they have smaller populations but higher energy needs.
Mars thinks distribution should be weighted by proximity to the Sun,
since the inner planets are contributing more to the construction
effort."

"That's a distribution policy question. It's not an engineering
question."

"Everything is an engineering question until it becomes a political
question," Amiri said. "And it becomes a political question the moment
someone's tax revenue is involved."

Tanaka leaned back in her chair and looked past Amiri at the Sun. It
filled the viewport like a wall of white fire. Somewhere out there,
Collector One was orbiting in its assigned slot, a four-hundred-meter
hexagon that was, against the scale of the Sun, approximately the size
of a bacterium on a basketball. Nineteen billion more to go.

"Schedule the Venus presentation," she said. "And set up a call with
the Martian infrastructure attaché. I'll talk to them."

"You personally?"

"Is that a problem?"

Amiri hesitated. "You're the Chief Architect. Your time is -- "

"My time is spent building a swarm. If the swarm doesn't get funded,
my time is spent doing nothing. I'll talk to Mars."

                               * * *

After the meeting, Tanaka walked to the fabrication bay on the station's
lower deck, where a one-tenth scale model of a collector was being
assembled for stress testing. The bay was a cavernous space, zero-
gravity, lit by banks of industrial LEDs that gave everything a flat,
shadowless brightness. A crew of six technicians floated among the
model's struts and panels, their mag-boots clicking against the
structural members as they moved from joint to joint.

She found Hiro Watanabe, her chief materials engineer, suspended upside
down relative to her orientation, examining a stress fracture in one of
the model's deployment hinges through a magnifying visor.

"How bad?" she asked.

Watanabe rotated to face her, his visor pushed up on his forehead. He
was a small, precise man with the unflappable temperament of someone
who had spent thirty years solving problems that could kill people if
solved incorrectly.

"Bad enough. The hinge alloy is failing at the thermal cycling spec.
The temperature differential between sunward and shadow faces is
producing micro-fractures at the joint after approximately forty
thousand cycles."

"Design life is two hundred thousand cycles."

"Yes."

Tanaka pulled herself to the hinge and examined the fracture. It was
barely visible -- a hairline crack in the dark alloy, no wider than a
human hair. But at scale, on a full-size collector, this crack would
propagate. The hinge would fail. The collector would lose its ability
to adjust its angle to the Sun. It would drift out of formation. And
a collector out of formation was a collector that could collide with
its neighbors, producing a cascade of debris that could take out
dozens, hundreds, thousands of units.

"Options?" she said.

"Three. First, we change the alloy. I have a titanium-vanadium composite
that tests well in the thermal range, but it's thirty percent heavier,
which means more propellant for station-keeping, which means a larger
propellant budget per collector, which means -- "

"Which means the mass budget for Phase I doesn't close. Next."

"Second, we reduce the thermal cycling by limiting the collector's
orientation range. If we restrict the tilt angle to plus-or-minus
fifteen degrees instead of thirty, the temperature differential drops
enough to extend the hinge life to design spec."

"What does that do to energy capture efficiency?"

"Drops it by about twelve percent."

Tanaka shook her head. Twelve percent efficiency loss across nineteen
billion collectors was a staggering quantity of energy. It would push
the breakeven point for the swarm back by years and give the political
opposition exactly the ammunition they needed.

"Third?"

Watanabe looked at her with the expression of an engineer who has found
an elegant solution and is trying not to appear too pleased with himself.
"We redesign the hinge. Instead of a single pivot joint, we use a
compound flexure -- essentially a living hinge that distributes the
thermal stress across a larger volume of material. It's more complex to
fabricate, but it eliminates the stress concentration at the pivot point
entirely."

"Cost?"

"In money? About twenty percent more per hinge. In time? I need six
weeks to design, build, and test a prototype."

"We have three weeks of schedule margin."

"Then I'll do it in three."

Tanaka studied his face. Watanabe was not a man who made promises he
could not keep. If he said three weeks, he meant three weeks and
possibly four, but not five. That was a margin she could work with.

"Do it," she said.

                               III.

The quarters assigned to the Chief Architect were on the station's
habitation ring, which rotated at a rate that produced approximately
one-third Earth gravity -- enough to keep the body from deteriorating,
not enough to feel like home. Tanaka had personalized the space
minimally: a photograph of her parents on the desk, a small ikebana
arrangement in a magnetic vase, and a framed copy of the project charter
signed by every member of the initial design team.

She sat at her desk at 22:00, station time, and opened her personal
log. She had kept a log since her first job out of university --
a highway bridge in Sapporo -- and the habit was as fundamental to
her working method as her slide rule, which she still carried in her
breast pocket despite the existence of computers that could perform the
same calculations a billion times faster. The slide rule had been her
father's. He had given it to her when she graduated, along with a piece
of advice that she had never forgotten: "The computer will give you the
answer. The slide rule will make you understand the question."

She typed:

"Day 427. Collector One deployed successfully. Telemetry nominal.
Fabrication schedule slipping -- Fab Two smelting modules behind three
weeks. Watanabe has identified a hinge failure mode that requires
redesign. He believes he can solve it in three weeks. I believe him.

"Mercury is becoming a political problem. Vasquez is not hostile, but
she is under pressure from her citizens' council, and she will do what
her constituents demand. Venus is nervous. Mars is calculating. The
Jovians have been silent, which means they are either uninterested or
planning something.

"The irony of this project is not lost on me. We are building the
largest structure in human history, and the greatest obstacles are not
structural. They are not thermal, orbital, or material. They are human.
People do not object to the engineering. They object to the implications
of the engineering. They object to someone else deciding what happens to
their Sun.

"Their Sun. Not the Sun. Their Sun.

"I understand this. I grew up watching my father argue with town
councils about highway routes. The arguments were never really about
traffic flow or noise levels or property values. They were about
control. Who decides what the landscape looks like? Who decides where
the road goes? Who decides what the future holds?

"In this case, the landscape is the solar system, the road is a swarm
of nineteen billion collectors, and the future holds more energy than
humanity has ever imagined -- if we can agree to build the thing.

"Tomorrow: presentation prep for the Venusian delegation. Fab Two
inspection. Hinge redesign review with Watanabe. Call with Martian
infrastructure attaché, which I am looking forward to the way one
looks forward to a dental procedure."

She saved the log, closed the terminal, and went to the viewport. The
habitation ring's rotation brought the Sun into view every ninety
seconds, a slow sweep of light across the reinforced glass. She watched
it pass once, twice, three times.

Somewhere out there, a single hexagonal collector was orbiting in the
dark, catching sunlight and converting it to energy. One down. Nineteen
billion to go.

She went to bed.

                               IV.

The call with the Martian infrastructure attaché went about as well as
Tanaka had expected, which was to say it went politely, substantively,
and nowhere.

The attaché was a man named Devereaux, a career bureaucrat with the
Tharsis Administrative Authority who had the smooth, unhurried manner
of someone who had spent twenty years in meetings and had learned that
patience was the most effective weapon in any negotiation. He listened
to Tanaka's presentation on the collector deployment sequence, asked
informed questions about the energy distribution model, and then
explained, with the gentle firmness of a man who was not going to be
rushed, that Mars had concerns.

The concerns were, as Amiri had predicted, about distribution equity.
Mars was contributing raw materials to the Initiative -- iron, aluminum,
silicates from the Olympus Mons mining operations -- and the Tharsis
Authority felt that this contribution entitled Mars to a preferential
energy allocation when the swarm reached operational capacity. The
Jovian settlements, which were contributing primarily labor, would
receive energy on the same per-capita basis as everyone else, but Mars
wanted a premium.

"You understand our position," Devereaux said. His face on the screen
was composed, amiable, unreadable. "We are providing the building
blocks. Without Martian materials, the fabrication plants cannot
operate. We feel this warrants recognition in the distribution
framework."

"The distribution framework hasn't been finalized," Tanaka said. "It's
a Phase III agenda item."

"We believe it should be a Phase I agenda item. It is difficult to ask
our citizens to support a fifty-year project when they do not know what
their share of the output will be."

"The project benefits everyone."

"In the abstract, yes. In the specific, it benefits some more than
others, depending on how the energy is allocated. We would like to
ensure that the specifics are favorable to those who are bearing the
material costs."

Tanaka recognized the logic. It was the logic of every infrastructure
negotiation she had ever participated in: everyone supported the
project in principle; everyone wanted a larger share of the output;
everyone wanted someone else to bear more of the cost. It was rational,
it was predictable, and it was the reason that large-scale engineering
projects took twice as long to approve as they took to build.

"I'll take your concerns to the Initiative board," she said. "We'll
prepare a preliminary distribution analysis for your review."

"We appreciate that. And Chief Architect? One more thing."

"Yes?"

"Governor Vasquez has invited the Tharsis Authority to co-sponsor her
resolution to the Solar Confederation assembly calling for an
independent environmental review of the Initiative's impact on inner-
system solar irradiance."

Tanaka felt something tighten in her chest. "And?"

"We are considering it. We have not committed. But we are considering
it."

The screen went dark. Tanaka sat in her chair and stared at the blank
display for a long time.

An independent environmental review would take eighteen months. The
Phase I deadline was in twenty-two months. By the time the review was
complete, the funding vote would have slipped, the political window
would have narrowed, and the opposition would have consolidated.
Mercury and Mars, together, represented enough votes on the
Confederation Assembly to force the review through.

She needed Venus. She needed the Jovians. She needed the Phase I
demonstration to be so successful, so undeniably impressive, that the
political objections would collapse under the weight of the results.

She needed nineteen billion collectors, and she had one.

She reached into her breast pocket and pulled out her father's slide
rule. She did not use it to calculate anything. She held it in her
hands, feeling its weight, its smooth wooden surfaces, the precision
of its machined markings. It was a tool from another era, an era when
engineering problems had engineering solutions and the biggest obstacle
to building a bridge was the river.

She put it back in her pocket, opened her terminal, and went to work.

                               V.

Six weeks later, the hinge crisis was resolved and three new ones had
taken its place.

Watanabe delivered the compound flexure hinge on schedule, as promised.
The test results were excellent -- the redesigned joint survived three
hundred thousand thermal cycles without failure, well above the two-
hundred-thousand-cycle design life. Tanaka authorized the design change,
the fabrication specs were updated, and Fab One began producing
collectors with the new hinges.

Then the smelting modules on Fab Two failed their final inspection. A
manufacturing defect in the heat exchangers -- a tolerance error of six-
hundredths of a millimeter in the coolant channels -- meant that the
modules could not maintain the precise temperature control required for
the silicon purification process. The modules had been built by a
subcontractor on Ceres, and the defect had not been caught during the
subcontractor's quality assurance process because the testing protocol
used a different thermal profile than the actual operating conditions
at Mercury's orbital distance.

Six-hundredths of a millimeter. A human hair was roughly seventy
micrometers in diameter. The defect was smaller than a hair.

It set the project back seven weeks.

Tanaka spent those seven weeks doing three things: managing the
remediation of the smelting modules, preparing for the Venusian
delegation's visit, and reading the daily intelligence summaries that
Amiri compiled on the political situation across the solar system.

The summaries were not encouraging.

Governor Vasquez had given a speech to the Mercurian Citizens' Council
in which she described the Dyson Initiative as "the most consequential
decision facing the people of Mercury since the founding of the
colony," and called for a "full and transparent public debate" on the
project's implications. The speech was moderate in tone -- Vasquez was
too savvy a politician to oppose the Initiative openly -- but its effect
was to legitimize opposition. Within a week, three anti-Initiative
citizens' groups had formed on Mercury, and their messaging was
spreading across the system's information networks.

The Martian position was hardening. Devereaux's polite noncommittal had
curdled into something more pointed: the Tharsis Authority now formally
supported an independent environmental review, and they had begun
lobbying the Jovian delegations to join the resolution.

And on Earth, where the Initiative had originated and where its most
passionate supporters lived, the political establishment was beginning
to show the first signs of the disease that killed all long-term
projects: loss of interest. The Dyson Initiative had been front-page
news when it was announced. Three years later, it was a budget line
item, competing for attention with a dozen other priorities, and the
politicians who had championed it were discovering that "we're building
a sunshade" was not the kind of slogan that won elections.

Tanaka documented all of this in her log. She documented the smelting
module remediation. She documented the hinge test results, the
fabrication output statistics, the propellant budget revisions. She
documented the things she could control and the things she could not,
side by side, in the same neutral, technical language, because she was
an engineer and an engineer's job was to describe reality accurately,
even when reality was not cooperating.

On the night before the Venusian delegation arrived, she stood in the
observation gallery and watched the Sun. Collector One was still out
there, still orbiting, still catching light. In the six weeks since its
deployment, it had generated enough energy to power a small city for a
year. A small city's worth of energy from a single collector. Multiply
that by nineteen billion, and you had -- well, you had the future. The
future of the species. Unlimited energy. The end of scarcity. The
beginning of something that Tanaka did not have a word for, something
beyond abundance, beyond prosperity, beyond anything that humanity had
ever experienced.

All they had to do was build it.

She pressed her palms against the glass and felt the warmth of the Sun
and thought about her father's bridges, and she wondered if there had
ever been a bridge that the whole world needed to agree on before the
first pylon could be sunk.

                               * * *

The Venusian delegation arrived on a diplomatic shuttle at 10:00 the
next morning: seven officials from the Venusian Terraforming Authority,
plus their technical staff, plus a journalist from the Venus Dispatch
who had somehow obtained press credentials despite Tanaka's explicit
request that the visit be kept private.

Amiri met them at the docking bay with his diplomat's smile firmly in
place. Tanaka met them in the conference room, where she had spent the
previous evening arranging the data displays to tell a specific story:
the story of a project that was on track, on budget, and on its way to
delivering transformative benefits to every human settlement in the
solar system, including and especially Venus.

The delegation's leader was a woman named Chen Wei-Lin, the Authority's
director of atmospheric processing. She was sixty, sharp-featured, with
the direct manner of a scientist who had spent her career doing
practical work and had no patience for abstractions. She listened to
Tanaka's presentation with her arms folded and her expression neutral,
and when Tanaka had finished, she asked a single question.

"What happens to our atmospheric processors when the swarm blocks
thirty-seven percent of our sunlight?"

Tanaka had prepared for this question. She pulled up the energy model
and walked Chen through it: the swarm would reduce Venus's raw solar
irradiance, yes, but the energy feed from the collector network would
more than compensate. Venus's atmospheric processors, which currently
ran on solar-thermal power, would be converted to direct energy feeds
from the swarm, tripling their throughput. The terraforming timeline
would accelerate from three centuries to one.

"You're asking us to trade our independence for efficiency," Chen said.

"I'm showing you that the efficiency gains are transformative."

"Transformative for whom? Right now, our processors run on sunlight.
Sunlight is free. Sunlight does not require a political negotiation.
If we become dependent on the swarm for our energy, we become dependent
on whoever controls the swarm's distribution network. And that
network's governance structure has not been defined."

"It will be defined."

"When?"

"Phase III."

Chen looked at her with the weary skepticism of a woman who had heard
too many promises indexed to future phases. "Chief Architect, I support
this project. My government supports this project. Venus will benefit
enormously from the Dyson swarm, and I am not here to obstruct its
progress. But I need to bring something back to my board -- something
concrete, not a projection, not a promise -- that addresses the
governance question. My people need to know who decides how the energy
is distributed, and they need to know it before they commit to a fifty-
year construction program that will fundamentally alter their
relationship with the Sun."

Tanaka looked at Chen, and she saw in the older woman's face the same
expression she had seen on her father's face at a hundred town hall
meetings: the expression of someone who understood the project's value
but needed the project's builders to understand something in return.

"Give me sixty days," Tanaka said. "I'll draft a preliminary governance
framework for your review. Nothing binding. A starting point for
negotiation."

Chen studied her. "Sixty days."

"Sixty days."

"I can sell sixty days to my board." Chen uncrossed her arms. "Now show
me the collector."

                               * * *

They took the delegation to the observation gallery, and Tanaka watched
Chen Wei-Lin's face as the Sun filled the viewport. The scientist's
expression did not change -- she was too disciplined for that -- but
something shifted behind her eyes. Something that Tanaka recognized,
because she had felt it herself the first time she had stood in this
gallery and looked at the star that was the center of everything.

Awe. Despite everything -- the politics, the budgets, the hinge
failures, the smelting module defects, the endless negotiating --
despite all of it, the project was awesome, in the old, terrifying
sense of the word. They were building a structure around the Sun. They
were reaching out to the source of all life in the solar system and
wrapping it in a skin of human ingenuity. It was presumptuous. It was
magnificent. It was, Tanaka believed with every fiber of her engineer's
soul, necessary.

Chen turned to her. "It's a hell of a thing," she said quietly.

"Yes," Tanaka said. "It is."

They stood together in the gallery, the Sun blazing through the
reinforced glass, and for a moment they were not a chief architect and
a delegation leader with competing political mandates. They were two
human beings looking at a star and contemplating the audacity of what
their species was attempting to do with it.

Then Chen's communications officer interrupted with a priority message
from Venus, and the moment was over, and they went back to being
politicians.

                               VI.

Tanaka's log, Day 491:

"Fabrication output: Collectors Two through Fourteen deployed
successfully. All telemetry nominal. Swarm coordination protocols
operating within parameters -- the collectors are maintaining formation
without manual correction, which means the autonomous guidance system
is working. This is significant. If the guidance system can handle
fourteen units, it can handle fourteen thousand. If it can handle
fourteen thousand, it can handle fourteen billion. Scalability is
confirmed.

"The Venusian visit was productive. Chen is an ally, though a cautious
one. She needs governance commitments before she can provide political
cover. I have promised a preliminary framework in sixty days, which
means I need to do something I have been avoiding: talk to the lawyers.

"Smelting module remediation is complete. Fab Two is online. Production
rate is accelerating. If we maintain current trajectory, we will have
five hundred collectors deployed by the end of the fiscal year, which
is slightly ahead of the Phase I schedule. I want to bank that margin.
We will need it.

"Vasquez has scheduled a public forum on Mercury for next month.
Anti-Initiative sentiment is growing. The messaging is effective because
it is emotionally simple: They are stealing our Sun. It does not matter
that it is technically inaccurate. It captures something true about the
project's implications -- that we are proposing to alter the most
fundamental feature of everyone's environment, and we are asking them
to trust us.

"Trust is not an engineering specification. I cannot test for it, I
cannot calculate its load tolerance, and I cannot redesign it when it
fails. But it is the most critical material in this project, and we
are running low on supply.

"I need to find a way to build trust the way I build collectors: one
unit at a time, in formation, with each one supporting the others.

"I do not know how to do this yet. But I am an engineer. I will figure
it out."

She saved the log. She went to bed. The Sun came around again, and
again, and again, ninety seconds of light, ninety seconds of dark,
and in the dark between the passes, Yuki Tanaka slept the shallow,
restless sleep of a woman who was trying to build something too large
for any one person to hold in her mind.

                       OBEDIENCE INDEX

================================================================================

                               I.

They came for Ana Ruiz on a Tuesday, which she had always suspected they
would. Tuesdays had a quality of administrative inevitability about them
-- they were the days when the regime did its paperwork, processed its
quotas, crossed its names off its lists. Monday was for announcements.
Wednesday was for enforcement. Thursday was for trials. Friday was for
the broadcasts that told you what to feel about the week's events.
Saturday and Sunday were for the silence in which you tried to remember
what it had been like before there was a schedule for everything,
including your emotions.

But Tuesday -- Tuesday was for the knock on the door.

The knock came at 6:14 in the morning. Ana was already awake. She had
been awake since four, lying in the narrow bed in her one-room
apartment on the seventh floor of Residential Block 4417, staring at
the ceiling and listening to the building's pre-dawn sounds: the hum
of the centralized heating system, the distant clank of the elevator
(which had not worked in three months but still made noises, as if the
machine's ghost was performing the function that the machine itself
could not), and the soft, arrhythmic creaking of the pipes that was,
she had decided, the closest thing this building had to a heartbeat.

She had been listening for the knock. Not because she knew it was
coming today, specifically. She had been listening for it every Tuesday
for the past seven months, since she had attended the meeting in
Comrade Fortunato's basement and heard, for the first time, the word
that changed everything.

The word was _loyalty_. Not in the way the regime used it -- as a
command, a demand, a condition of citizenship. In the way the
resistance used it. As a question.

What does it mean to be loyal? And loyal to what? And what happens when
a machine can tell the difference?

                               * * *

The door opened before she could reach it. They had a key -- of course
they had a key; they had keys to everything, every door, every drawer,
every compartment of your life that you imagined was private. There were
three of them: two Civic Order officers in their gray uniforms and a
technician in a white coat carrying a metal case the size of a lunch
box. The officers were young, blank-faced, interchangeable in the way
that the regime preferred its enforcement personnel to be. The
technician was older, perhaps fifty, with thinning hair and the
distracted expression of a man who was thinking about calibration
settings.

"Citizen Ana Cristina Ruiz?" said the first officer. He did not phrase
it as a question.

"Yes."

"You are scheduled for Patriotic Assessment. Please remain calm and
cooperate fully. The procedure is painless and takes approximately
twelve minutes."

Ana looked at the metal case. It was brushed aluminum, with a
manufacturer's stamp on the lid that she could not read from this
distance. A single green light glowed on its surface.

"What is Patriotic Assessment?" she asked. She knew the answer. She
asked because not asking would be suspicious. An innocent citizen would
ask. An innocent citizen would be mildly confused, slightly annoyed at
the early hour, possibly curious. Ana performed these emotions with the
skill of a woman who had spent seven months practicing the art of
appearing to have nothing to hide.

"The Patriotic Assessment is a routine wellness evaluation mandated by
the Ministry of Civic Harmony," the officer recited. "It measures
neurochemical indicators associated with civic engagement and
patriotic sentiment. Citizens who score within the optimal range
receive a certificate of patriotic health. Citizens who score below
the optimal range are referred for treatment."

"Treatment for what?"

The officer paused, as though the question had momentarily exceeded his
script. "Insufficient civic engagement," he said.

The technician had already opened the case and was assembling the
device. It was smaller than Ana had expected -- she had imagined
something dramatic, something with wires and screens and the aesthetic
menace of a machine designed to look into your soul. In reality, it
looked like a medical instrument: a smooth, pale gray unit about the
size of a paperback book, with a curved sensor pad on one end and a
small display screen on the other. A thin cable connected it to a data
recorder in the case.

"Please sit down," the technician said, without looking at her. He was
adjusting something on the device with a small screwdriver. "I'll need
you to remain still for the duration of the scan."

Ana sat in the room's single chair. The technician placed the sensor
pad against her left temple and pressed a button. The device emitted a
soft hum -- not unpleasant, more like the vibration of a tuning fork
held near the ear.

"What is it measuring?" she asked.

The technician glanced at her, surprised. Most people, his expression
suggested, did not ask. "Dopamine and oxytocin ratios in the prefrontal
cortex, correlated with serotonin uptake patterns in the limbic system.
The algorithm analyzes the neurochemical profile against a baseline
model of patriotic sentiment."

"A baseline model."

"Yes. The Ministry has established a neurochemical signature associated
with genuine civic loyalty. The device measures the degree of
correspondence between your neural profile and the baseline."

"How was the baseline established?"

The technician looked at her more carefully now. "From a sample
population of citizens with demonstrated patriotic commitment."

"Demonstrated how?"

"Through behavioral metrics. Voting participation, civic volunteer
hours, public affirmation of state values, absence of antisocial
indicators." He paused. "The science is sound. The correlation between
the neurochemical profile and observable patriotic behavior is
ninety-three percent."

Ninety-three percent. Ana filed this number. It meant that seven
percent of people who tested as loyal were not, and seven percent of
people who tested as disloyal were. She was a mathematician by training
-- she had taught secondary school mathematics before the regime had
restructured the education system and replaced mathematics with
Principles of Civic Harmony -- and she understood what seven percent
meant. It meant that for every hundred people scanned, seven would be
misclassified. In a city of eight million, that was five hundred and
sixty thousand people.

She sat very still and thought about what she was feeling. Fear,
certainly. Anger, which she had long ago learned to keep below the
surface, like a fish in dark water. And something else -- something
that she could not name, that lived in the gap between the person she
was performing and the person she was. She wondered which one the
machine would see.

                               II.

The scan took eleven minutes. The technician watched his display with
the focused attention of a man reading a particularly absorbing novel,
occasionally making notes in a small ledger. The two officers stood by
the door, their posture communicating boredom and authority in equal
measure.

When it was finished, the technician removed the sensor pad, examined
his display, and typed a series of numbers into the data recorder. He
did not tell Ana her score. He closed the case, nodded to the officers,
and walked out of the room without speaking.

"Your results will be processed within seventy-two hours," the first
officer said. "You will receive notification by mail. If your assessment
falls within the optimal range, no further action is required. If it
does not, you will be contacted by the Ministry of Civic Harmony to
schedule a treatment consultation."

He paused, as if trying to remember the next line. "The State values
your patriotism and thanks you for your cooperation."

They left. Ana locked the door behind them -- a meaningless gesture,
since they had a key, but the click of the deadbolt was a sound that
she needed to hear. She sat down in the chair and pressed her hands
flat against her knees and breathed.

Seventy-two hours. Three days to find out whether the machine had seen
through her.

She thought about Comrade Fortunato's basement, and the faces of the
eleven people who met there every Thursday night, and the conversations
they had about what the loyalty machine meant for the resistance, and
she wondered how many of them had already been scanned, and how many
of them had passed, and how many of them were sitting in rooms like this
one, pressing their hands against their knees and breathing.

                               * * *

She went to the meeting that night. It was a risk -- the regime
monitored movement patterns, and a deviation from routine on the day of
an assessment could trigger a flag in the surveillance system. But the
meeting was necessary. The resistance needed to know about the scan, and
they needed to know quickly, because if the machine worked -- if it
could actually distinguish genuine loyalty from performance -- then
everything they had built was in danger.

Fortunato's basement was beneath a hardware store on the Via Republica,
a street that had been renamed three times in Ana's lifetime and that
she still called, in the privacy of her own mind, by its original name:
Calle de los Muertos. The Street of the Dead. Named for a massacre that
the regime had erased from the official history but not from the
memories of the people who lived on the street, who walked over the
cobblestones where the blood had been and who knew, without ever saying
it aloud, what had happened there.

The basement was small, damp, and lit by a single bare bulb. Eleven
metal folding chairs arranged in a circle. A table with a water pitcher
and a stack of paper cups. No records, no documents, no evidence. The
resistance existed in the space between people, in words spoken and
immediately forgotten, in commitments made with a glance and honored
with a silence. It was the opposite of the regime, which existed in
paperwork, in databases, in the obsessive documentation of every
citizen's movements, utterances, and -- now -- neurochemistry.

Fortunato was already there when Ana arrived. He was a baker by trade,
a stout man with flour-dusted hands and a voice that carried without
being raised, and he had organized this cell because, as he said, "a
man who makes bread every morning knows that you cannot feed people
with fear." He greeted Ana with a nod and did not ask about the scan.
He did not need to ask. He could see it in her face.

There were six others tonight. Pilar, who worked in the records office
and had access to the regime's citizen databases. Diego, a mechanic who
maintained the cell's secure communications equipment. Old Marisol, who
had been a journalist before the press was nationalized and who served
as the cell's strategist. Tomás, a teenager whose parents had been
taken for treatment two years ago and who had joined the resistance the
day he turned sixteen. Lucia, a nurse at the state hospital, who had
seen what treatment looked like.

And Elena, who was new. Ana did not know her well. She had been
introduced by Pilar three weeks ago, and she sat in the circle with the
stillness of someone who was either very brave or very frightened, and
Ana could not tell which.

"They scanned me this morning," Ana said.

The room went quiet. Not the silence of surprise -- they had known it
was coming, known it was spreading through the city block by block,
building by building, door by door. The silence of attention.

"Tell us," Fortunato said.

Ana described the device, the technician, the procedure. She described
the neurochemical baseline -- dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, the
algorithm that mapped brain chemistry to political allegiance. She
described the ninety-three percent accuracy rate.

"Seven percent error," Marisol said. She was seventy-one years old and
had the hard, clear eyes of a woman who had survived three regimes and
expected to survive this one. "In a population of eight million, that's
over half a million misclassifications."

"Yes."

"Which means half a million loyal citizens flagged as disloyal, and
half a million disloyal citizens passing as loyal."

"Approximately."

"The regime won't care about the false positives," Marisol said. "False
positives are useful. A citizen who is loyal but flagged as disloyal can
be treated and made more loyal. The machine converts ambiguity into
compliance. That's the purpose."

Ana nodded. Marisol had articulated what she had been thinking but had
not yet put into words. The machine's imperfection was not a flaw. It
was a feature. A perfect loyalty detector would only catch the disloyal.
An imperfect one would catch the disloyal and terrorize the loyal, which
was far more effective as a tool of control.

"What about us?" Diego asked. He was a practical man who distrusted
abstractions. "Can we beat it?"

"I don't know," Ana said. "I don't know if I beat it. I won't know for
seventy-two hours."

"What did you feel during the scan?"

Ana considered the question carefully. "I tried to feel nothing. I tried
to think about mundane things -- my grocery list, a mathematical
problem, the pattern on the ceiling. I don't know if that was the right
strategy. The machine isn't measuring thoughts. It's measuring
neurochemistry. You can control your thoughts. I'm not sure you can
control your dopamine."

"You can't," Lucia said. She was sitting forward in her chair, her
nurse's hands clasped between her knees. "I've seen the treatment
protocols. The machine measures what it measures. If your brain
chemistry doesn't match the loyalty profile, no amount of mental
discipline will change the reading. The only way to beat the machine
is to genuinely feel what the machine is looking for."

"Genuine patriotism," Tomás said. He was sixteen. His voice cracked on
the word _patriotism_ as though it were a foreign language he had not
yet learned to pronounce. "We're supposed to genuinely love the regime?"

"That's what they're demanding," Lucia said. "Not behavior. Not
compliance. Not the performance of loyalty. The real thing. The actual
neurochemical state. They want to own your feelings."

The room went quiet again. Ana looked at the faces around her -- the
baker, the mechanic, the old journalist, the boy, the nurse, the new
woman who had not yet spoken -- and she saw in each face a version of
the same thought. The regime had always demanded obedience. It had
demanded conformity, silence, the surrender of public identity to the
state's requirements. But it had not demanded this. It had not demanded
that you feel differently than you felt. It had not demanded that your
brain chemistry align with a loyalty baseline constructed from the
neural profiles of the most compliant citizens in the population.

This was new. This was something else.

"There's another option," Elena said. It was the first time she had
spoken. Her voice was low, steady, and carried a quality that Ana could
not immediately identify -- not fear, not anger, but something colder
and more considered. "We let them take us. We let them scan us, and we
fail, and we let them treat us."

Silence.

"And then what?" Fortunato asked.

"Then we see what the treatment does. We see if it changes us, or if
it just changes the readings. And if it just changes the readings, we
come back. And if it changes us..." She paused. "Then we know what
we're fighting."

                               III.

Ana spent the next seventy-two hours in a state of suspended animation.
She went to her assigned work site -- a garment factory in the
industrial district, where she sewed buttons on gray cotton shirts for
nine hours a day, a job that had been given to her after her teaching
position was eliminated and that she performed with the mechanical
efficiency of a person who has decided that the body can do one thing
while the mind does another. She ate in the communal cafeteria. She
returned to her apartment. She did not go to the meeting.

She thought about Elena's proposal. Let them take us. Let them treat
us. See what happens.

It was either the bravest thing she had ever heard or the most reckless,
and she could not decide which. The treatment was not a mystery -- Lucia
had described it in enough clinical detail to make the room flinch.
A pharmaceutical protocol combined with intensive conditioning: drugs
that altered the brain's neurochemistry to match the loyalty baseline,
administered over six weeks in a residential facility, accompanied by
daily sessions of what the Ministry called "civic recalibration" and
what Lucia called "the reshaping." The patients emerged altered. Not
brain-damaged, not lobotomized, nothing so crude. They emerged with
their intelligence intact, their memories intact, their personalities
largely intact. But something was different. Something had shifted.

"They come out believing," Lucia had said. "Not performing belief. Not
pretending. Believing. They love the regime the way you love your
mother. It's in their eyes. It's in their voice when they talk about
the President. It's genuine."

"Is it reversible?"

Lucia had hesitated. "I don't know. I've never seen anyone try to
reverse it. Once they've been through the treatment, they don't want
it reversed. That's the point."

That was the point. The machine measured loyalty. The treatment produced
it. Together, they formed a closed loop: scan, identify, treat, rescan.
Every citizen either genuinely loved the regime or would be made to.
There was no space between compliance and belief, no gap in which a
private self could exist, no room for the silent, stubborn,
ungovernable act of disagreeing in your own skull.

On the third day, the letter arrived.

It was a single sheet of heavy paper, embossed with the seal of the
Ministry of Civic Harmony. It informed Citizen Ana Cristina Ruiz that
her Patriotic Assessment had been evaluated and that her neurochemical
profile fell within the optimal range for civic engagement and patriotic
sentiment. A certificate of patriotic health was enclosed. No further
action was required.

She had passed.

Ana held the certificate in both hands and stared at it. She had
passed. The machine had scanned her brain, measured her neurochemistry,
compared it to the loyalty baseline, and determined that she was a
patriot. A genuine, neurochemically verified patriot.

She set the certificate on her table and went to the window. The city
spread out below her: gray blocks of residential housing, the factory
smokestacks, the Ministry tower in the distance with its perpetual
flag. Somewhere in this city, other people were receiving their letters.
Some of them had passed. Some of them had not.

She thought about the seven percent error rate. She had passed, but
was she a true negative or a false negative? Was the machine correct
that she was loyal, or had it simply failed to detect her disloyalty?
She did not know. She did not know if the machine knew.

She thought about Elena's proposal. Let them take us.

She thought about what it would mean to volunteer for treatment -- to
walk into the Ministry, surrender her body, and let them reshape her
brain until the person who emerged was someone who genuinely loved the
regime that had killed Tomás's parents, that had silenced Marisol's
newspaper, that had replaced mathematics with ideology in the schools,
that had turned a nation of citizens into a population of patients.

She thought about what it would mean to become that person. Not to
pretend. To become.

Was there a version of herself, hidden in the seven percent margin of
error, who already was that person? Was loyalty a fact about her brain
or a choice she made every morning when she woke up in her narrow bed
and decided, again, to be the person she was instead of the person
the regime wanted her to be?

She picked up the certificate. She turned it over. On the back, there
was nothing -- blank paper, smooth and white.

She folded it carefully, placed it in her pocket, and went to the
meeting.

                               IV.

The meeting was smaller than usual. Fortunato, Marisol, Diego, Lucia.
No Pilar -- she had been called for a shift at the records office, or
she had been taken, and they would not know which until she appeared or
did not. No Tomás -- his whereabouts unknown since yesterday, which
could mean anything or nothing. No Elena.

"Tomás was scanned this morning," Diego said. "My source at the Civic
Order office confirmed it. He failed."

The word _failed_ hung in the air. A sixteen-year-old boy with dead
parents and a heart full of fury. Of course he had failed. The machine
measured neurochemistry, and there was no drug in the world, no trick
of mental discipline, no amount of performance, that could make Tomás's
brain produce the chemical signature of loving the regime that had
taken his mother and father.

"Where is he?" Fortunato asked.

"Treatment facility on the Avenida Nacional. Admitted this afternoon."

Silence.

"I passed," Ana said.

They looked at her.

"I received my certificate this morning. The machine says I'm a
patriot." She paused. "I don't know why I passed. I don't know what it
saw in my brain that it didn't see in Tomás's. Maybe the seven percent
error is larger than they claim. Maybe I'm better at hiding than I
think I am. Maybe some part of me actually is what they're looking for."

"Does it matter?" Marisol asked. "You passed. You're safe. Use it."

"Safe for now. They'll scan again. Every six months, according to
Pilar's information. Each time, the algorithm is refined. Each time,
the error rate drops. Eventually, the machine will see through
everyone."

"Then we have to act before eventually arrives."

"Act how?" Diego demanded. "We're eleven people -- nine now, maybe
eight. We have no weapons, no organization beyond this basement, no
plan beyond surviving. The machine is spreading. By next month, every
citizen in the city will have been scanned. By next year, every citizen
in the country. What are we going to do? Destroy the machine? There
are hundreds of them. Destroy the regime? With what?"

"With the seven percent," Ana said.

They looked at her.

"Seven percent of the population will be misclassified. That's the
machine's flaw. But it cuts both ways. Seven percent of the regime's
most trusted citizens -- the ones who scan as perfectly loyal -- are
not. They're performing. They're hiding. They're us, and we don't know
who they are, and they don't know who we are. But they're out there.
Half a million people who the machine says are patriots but who are,
in their hearts, something else."

"You want to find them," Marisol said.

"I want to understand that they exist. That the machine's promise --
total legibility, perfect knowledge of every citizen's inner state --
is a lie. The regime is building its power on a ninety-three percent
confidence interval. That means seven percent of its foundation is
hollow. The question is whether seven percent is enough."

"Enough for what?" Diego asked.

Ana did not answer immediately. She looked at the circle of chairs, at
the faces of the people who had risked everything to sit in a baker's
basement and speak the truth to each other. She thought about Tomás, in
a treatment facility, having his brain reshaped until the boy who hated
the regime became a man who loved it. She thought about the certificate
in her pocket, the regime's seal pressed into heavy paper, certifying
that she was loyal.

"Enough to matter," she said.

                               V.

The next Thursday, Elena came back.

She walked into the basement with the same stillness she had carried
the first time, sat down in her chair, and looked at the circle. There
were seven of them now -- Pilar had returned, apologetic and unscanned,
her absence explained by a double shift at the records office. Tomás
was still in treatment. His chair was empty, and no one sat in it.

"I volunteered," Elena said.

The word _volunteered_ required no explanation. They understood.

"Tell us," Fortunato said.

"I went to the Ministry yesterday. I told them I had been experiencing
feelings of civic disconnection and that I wanted help. They were
delighted." A thin, humorless smile. "They don't get many volunteers.
Most people have to be brought in. A volunteer is a propaganda coup --
proof that the system works, that citizens recognize their own
deficiencies and seek correction."

"They scanned you?"

"Immediately. Full neurochemical profile. I failed -- badly,
apparently. The technician looked at my readings the way a doctor looks
at a tumor." She paused. "They scheduled me for treatment. I start
Monday."

The silence in the room was absolute.

"Why?" Lucia asked. Her voice was barely above a whisper.

"Because someone has to know what the treatment does. Not from the
outside, not from a clinical report. From the inside. Someone from the
resistance has to go through it and come out the other side and tell us
whether the person who comes out is still the person who went in."

"And if they're not?" Ana asked. "If the treatment works? If the person
who comes out is genuinely loyal?"

Elena looked at her. "Then the person who comes out won't come back to
this basement. And you'll have your answer."

"That's not an answer. That's a sacrifice."

"Is there a difference?"

Ana wanted to argue. She wanted to say that there was always a
difference, that a sacrifice without purpose was not courage but waste,
that Elena was throwing herself into the machine to answer a question
that might not have an answer anyone could use. But she looked at
Elena's face -- calm, resolved, already somewhere beyond the room --
and she understood that the argument had already been had, inside Elena's
head, in the private silence where the regime could not follow, and
that Elena had made her decision the way you make the decisions that
define what you are: not with logic but with the part of yourself that
knows what it can and cannot live with.

"When you come out," Ana said. Not _if_. _When_.

"When I come out," Elena repeated. "I'll come here. If I can. If I'm
still the person who would come here."

"How will we know?"

Elena smiled -- a real smile, the first one Ana had seen from her. "Ask
me something only I would know."

"Like what?"

"Like why I joined the resistance."

"Why did you join the resistance?"

Elena looked at her, and the smile faded, and what replaced it was
something that Ana recognized as the closest thing to loyalty that the
machine would never be able to measure -- not the neurochemical
signature of compliance, not the dopamine profile of a citizen who
loved the state, but the fierce, ungovernable, unmeasurable thing that
makes a person look at the world as it is and decide, at the cost of
everything, to fight for the world as it should be.

"Because they told me what to feel," Elena said. "And I refused."

                               * * *

On Monday, Elena went to the Ministry.

On Tuesday, Ana went to work and sewed buttons on gray shirts and
thought about seven percent.

On Wednesday, she went home and looked at the certificate on her table
and wondered if the person the machine had certified as loyal was the
same person who sat in a baker's basement on Thursday nights and
conspired against the state.

On Thursday, she went to the meeting. Elena's chair was empty. Tomás's
chair was empty. The circle had seven people in it, and Ana could feel
the gaps where the missing should have been, the way you feel a phantom
limb -- the nerves still firing, the brain still expecting the weight
of something that is no longer there.

She sat in the circle and she waited.

Because that was what the resistance was, in the end. Not a plan. Not
an organization. Not a strategy or a weapon or a counter-machine. It
was the stubborn, unreasonable, neurochemically inexplicable decision
to remain yourself when the world demanded that you become someone else.
It was the seven percent. It was the margin of error. It was the gap
between what the machine could see and what a human being actually was.

Ana Ruiz sat in her chair in the baker's basement and she waited, and
she refused, and the loyalty machine hummed somewhere in the city, and
the regime went on measuring, and measuring, and measuring, and still
it could not measure this: a woman in a folding chair, in a circle of
light, choosing, with every breath, not to comply.

                            [THE END]

                    TREASURE OF THE SUNKEN FLEET

                        by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

Max Coretti had been diving in bad water for fifteen years, and Europa's
subsurface ocean was the worst water he had ever seen -- if you could
call it water. It was black as crude oil, cold enough to freeze your
blood in the time it took to swear, and pressurized to a degree that
made the Mariana Trench look like a kiddie pool. The only thing it had
going for it was that it was, technically, liquid, which meant you
could dive in it. Whether you should was a different question.

Coretti was not a man who spent a lot of time on "should."

He sat in the pilot's seat of the _Barracuda_ -- a deep-ocean salvage
submersible about as elegant as a garbage truck and roughly twice as
stubborn -- and watched the sonar display paint the ocean floor in
shades of green. Europa's subsurface sea was sixty miles deep and as
dark as the inside of a coffin. The _Barracuda_'s floods cut through
maybe two hundred meters of the murk before the particulate swallowed
the light. Everything beyond that range was sonar, and sonar in this
soup was about as reliable as a three-dollar compass.

"You seeing what I'm seeing?" said Dex Halloran from the co-pilot's
seat. Dex was Coretti's partner, which meant he was the person Coretti
trusted to not get him killed, most of the time. He was a lanky redhead
from Melbourne with a gift for mechanics and a worse gift for poker,
which was how Coretti had won his half of the _Barracuda_ three years
ago in a card game on Ganymede Station.

"I'm seeing a whole lot of nothing," Coretti said.

"Look again. Bearing two-seven-zero, range four thousand meters. Bottom
contact."

Coretti squinted at the display. The sonar return at the indicated
bearing was faint but solid -- a series of regular shapes on the ocean
floor, too geometric to be geological. In fifteen years of salvage
work, Coretti had learned to read sonar the way a tracker reads prints
in mud. Rocks were lumpy. Wrecks were angular. These shapes were
angular, but they were also huge. The largest return was nearly five
hundred meters long.

"Could be ice ridges," Coretti said, because he had been wrong before
and optimism was a luxury that got divers killed.

"Ice ridges don't come in rows."

Dex had a point. The shapes on the display were arranged in a formation
that was too orderly for natural geology -- three rows, roughly
parallel, with smaller objects clustered around the periphery. It
looked, Coretti thought, like a parking lot.

"Take us in. Slow."

Dex throttled the _Barracuda_'s propulsion system to minimum cruise and
adjusted their heading. The submersible groaned -- she always groaned at
depth, her hull flexing under the pressure like a man stretching after
a long sleep -- and began her descent toward the contact.

                               * * *

They had come to Europa on a contract from Jovian Salvage Incorporated,
a company that specialized in recovering valuable materials from the
moons of Jupiter. The official job was to survey a sector of Europa's
ocean floor that a mining company had flagged as a potential source of
rare-earth minerals. The unofficial job -- the one that Coretti
actually cared about -- was to find anything interesting and, if it was
valuable, to claim salvage rights before the mining company's own teams
got there.

Coretti had been a salvage diver since he was nineteen, when he had
dropped out of the Merchant Marine Academy on Earth to join a
deep-water recovery crew in the Caribbean. He had worked his way up
from grunt to crew chief to independent operator, and he had spent the
last decade working the outer solar system, where the salvage was
richer and the regulations were thinner. He had pulled wrecked cargo
haulers off the surface of Io, recovered mining equipment from the
ammonia seas of Titan, and once -- his proudest job -- extracted a
functional fusion reactor from a derelict research station in the rings
of Saturn.

He was forty-three years old, built like a fire hydrant, with a face
that looked like it had been assembled from spare parts -- broken nose
(twice), scar across the left cheekbone (bar fight on Callisto), and a
jaw that could have been used as a doorstop. He wore a leather jacket
that he claimed was lucky, and he smoked thin cigars that he was not
supposed to smoke inside the submersible but smoked anyway, because
what was the point of risking your life at the bottom of an alien ocean
if you couldn't enjoy a cigar while you did it?

"Range two thousand meters," Dex reported. "Bottom contact getting
stronger. Max -- these aren't mineral deposits."

"I can see that."

"They look like ships."

Coretti leaned forward and studied the display. Dex was right. As they
closed the range, the sonar returns resolved into sharper detail, and
the shapes on the ocean floor became unmistakable. They were ships.
Not human ships -- the proportions were wrong, the profiles unfamiliar,
the design language unlike anything Coretti had seen in any shipyard
from Earth to Neptune. They were sleek, elongated, with swept-back
structures that suggested speed even in stillness. Some of them were
enormous -- the largest was over five hundred meters stem to stern.
Others were smaller, clustered around the big ones like escort vessels
around a capital ship.

Coretti counted them. Fourteen large vessels. Thirty-odd smaller ones.
Arranged in formation on the ocean floor, partially embedded in the
ice substrate, as if they had settled there gently and been slowly
absorbed by the environment.

A fleet. A sunken fleet. An alien fleet, at the bottom of Europa's
ocean, where no alien fleet had any business being.

"Holy God," Dex said.

Coretti reached for a cigar, lit it, and blew a stream of smoke at the
viewport. Through the reinforced glass, the _Barracuda_'s floodlights
were beginning to catch the nearest vessel -- a dark, angular shape
emerging from the murk like a whale rising from the deep.

"Salvage rights," Coretti said. "We are filing salvage rights."

"Max, those are alien warships."

"They're salvage. They're on the bottom. Nobody's claimed them. That
makes them salvage."

"The Confederation government is going to have opinions about this."

"The Confederation government can get in line. We found them. We file
first. That's the law."

Dex stared at him. "You're insane."

"Probably. Take us closer."

                               * * *

The nearest ship was one of the smaller vessels -- about eighty meters
long, with a hull that was smooth and dark and reflected the
_Barracuda_'s floodlights with a faint iridescence, like oil on water.
It was partially encased in ice, its lower hull fused with the ocean
floor, but its upper surfaces were clear, and as the _Barracuda_
circled it at close range, Coretti could see details that made his
pulse quicken.

The hull was intact. Not corroded, not pitted, not damaged by
micro-meteor impact or radiation exposure or any of the thousand things
that destroyed human-built structures in the outer solar system over
time. The surface was as smooth and unblemished as the day it had been
built, whenever the hell that was.

"Check the temperature on that hull," Coretti said.

Dex ran the thermal scanner. "Ambient. Same as the surrounding water.
Dead cold."

"What about power emissions? Electromagnetic? Anything?"

"Scanning." A pause. "I'm getting... something. Low-level
electromagnetic output from the large vessels. Very faint. Could be
residual charge in their power systems, could be natural -- mineral
deposits can produce weak EM signatures."

"Mineral deposits don't park in formation."

"No," Dex agreed. "They don't."

Coretti guided the _Barracuda_ along the length of the small ship,
studying its contours. There were no visible ports, no windows, no
external sensors or antennae. The hull was featureless except for a
series of raised ridges that ran along its spine -- structural
reinforcements, maybe, or something else entirely. At the stern, a
cluster of nozzle-like openings suggested a propulsion system, though
of a type Coretti had never seen. The nozzles were arranged in a ring,
like the petals of a flower, and their inner surfaces caught the light
with a metallic gleam that was almost -- Coretti reached for the word
and found it -- beautiful.

"I want to take a look inside," Coretti said.

"Inside? Inside the alien warship? The alien warship of unknown origin
that has been sitting at the bottom of an alien ocean for an unknown
amount of time with unknown technology and unknown intentions?"

"That's the one."

"Max, no."

"Max, yes. Get me the EVA suit."

                               * * *

The EVA suit was a deep-ocean model rated for Europa's pressures -- a
bulky, armored affair that made Coretti look like a medieval knight
crossed with a deep-sea crab. He cycled through the _Barracuda_'s
ventral airlock and dropped into the water, his helmet lights cutting
two bright cones through the darkness.

The water was cold. Not Earth-cold, not jacket-and-hot-coffee cold, but
a deep, fundamental cold that pressed against the suit's thermal
regulation system like a hand pressing against a window. The suit's
heaters whined and compensated, but Coretti could feel the chill seeping
through, a reminder that this ocean existed at temperatures where human
life was a temporary and unwelcome condition.

He approached the small vessel's hull and placed his gloved hand against
it. The surface was smooth -- impossibly smooth, smoother than any
material Coretti had ever touched. His glove registered no texture,
no grain, no imperfection. It was like touching a mirror made of metal.

"I'm at the hull," he reported. "Surface is... strange. Perfectly
smooth. No corrosion, no biological growth, nothing. This thing has
been down here for God knows how long and it looks factory-new."

"That's not reassuring," Dex said through the comm.

"Not trying to reassure you. I'm going to follow the hull toward what
I think is an access point. There's a seam about thirty meters aft."

He moved along the hull, his magnetic boots clicking against the
surface -- at least the material was ferromagnetic, which was a small
mercy. The seam he had spotted from the _Barracuda_ resolved into a
rectangular outline in the hull, about three meters tall and two meters
wide. A door, or the alien equivalent.

There was no handle, no control panel, no obvious mechanism for opening
it. Coretti stood before it and considered his options. He could try
to cut through with the _Barracuda_'s plasma torch. He could try to pry
the seam open with the suit's manipulator arms. He could--

The door opened.

Not slowly, not dramatically, not with a hiss of escaping atmosphere
or a groan of ancient machinery. It simply opened, sliding into the
hull with a motion so smooth and silent that for a moment Coretti
thought he had imagined it. One instant the rectangle was a seam in
the hull. The next instant it was an opening, and beyond the opening
was darkness, and in the darkness something was glowing.

"Dex."

"I see it on your helmet cam. Max, get out of there."

"I'm going in."

"Max--"

"I'm going in."

He stepped through the door.

                               * * *

The interior of the ship was dark, cold, and alive.

Not alive in the biological sense -- there were no organisms, no slime,
no space barnacles or alien fungi clinging to the walls. Alive in the
mechanical sense. The ship's systems were running. Coretti could see it
in the faint glow that emanated from panels set into the walls at
irregular intervals -- a pale blue-green light that pulsed with a slow,
rhythmic cadence, like a heartbeat. The air -- if there was air; his
suit's sensors detected a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and trace gases,
breathable in theory but cold enough to freeze his lungs -- carried a
faint hum, a vibration more felt than heard, as if the ship's
machinery was idling.

The corridor was narrow by human standards, perhaps a meter and a half
wide, with low ceilings that forced Coretti to duck in his bulky EVA
suit. The walls were smooth and featureless, the same mirror-dark
material as the exterior hull, and they curved slightly inward at the
top, giving the passage the feel of walking through a large vein.

"I'm inside," Coretti reported. "The ship is powered. Low-level
systems are active. I'm seeing ambient lighting, atmospheric
containment, and what I think is a gravity field -- I'm feeling weight,
and it's not my boots."

"Max, a powered alien warship is not salvage. A powered alien warship
is a contact situation. You need to leave and we need to call the
Confederation."

"I'll call the Confederation after I've filed salvage rights."

"You can't file salvage rights on something that's still running!"

"Watch me."

He moved deeper into the ship. The corridor branched, and he took the
left fork, following the strongest concentration of the blue-green
light. The pulsing grew more pronounced as he advanced, and the
vibration in the walls intensified, and Coretti had the unmistakable
feeling of something waking up.

He emerged into a larger chamber -- a command center, maybe, or a
navigation room. The space was roughly circular, about fifteen meters
in diameter, with a low domed ceiling covered in the pulsing light
panels. In the center of the room stood a structure that Coretti
recognized, in the way that you recognize a chair even when it is
designed for a body that is not shaped like yours: a console. A
control station. A place where someone -- something -- sat and
directed the ship.

The console was dark. Whatever systems were running in the ship, the
command station was not among them.

But the walls were.

As Coretti entered the chamber, the light panels flared -- not
dramatically, not threateningly, but with the slow brightening of a
room adjusting to a new occupant. The blue-green glow intensified, and
patterns began to form on the walls: lines, curves, symbols that
Coretti could not read but that he recognized, instinctively, as
information. Maps, maybe. Diagrams. Instructions.

"Dex, are you recording this?"

"Every second. Max, the EM readings from the large vessels just
spiked. Whatever you're doing in there, the rest of the fleet is
responding."

Coretti felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up -- a difficult
trick inside an EVA suit, but his body managed it anyway. The rest of
the fleet was responding. He was standing inside a small escort vessel,
poking around its command center, and the capital ships were waking
up.

He looked at the patterns on the walls. They were changing, flowing
from one configuration to another with increasing speed, and something
about their movement pattern made Coretti think -- irrationally,
instinctively, with the gut feeling that had kept him alive through
fifteen years of salvage work in places where gut feelings were often
the only warning you got -- that the ship was not just responding to
his presence.

It was assessing him.

"Dex, how fast can you have the _Barracuda_ at the airlock?"

"Two minutes."

"Make it one."

Coretti turned and moved back toward the corridor. Behind him, the
light panels in the command chamber were now fully illuminated, and
the hum had become a tone -- a low, resonant note that vibrated in
his chest and made his teeth ache. The symbols on the walls were racing
now, flowing like water, and from somewhere deep in the ship -- from
below him, from the engineering spaces he had not explored -- he felt a
new vibration. Heavier. More purposeful.

Engines. The ship's engines were coming online.

He reached the corridor and ran -- or tried to run, because running in
a deep-ocean EVA suit was like running in a suit of armor filled with
molasses. He lurched and stomped and swore his way back to the hull
door, which was still open, thank God, and threw himself through it
into the black water of Europa's ocean.

Behind him, the door closed. Smoothly, silently, as if it had never
been open.

"_Barracuda_, I'm out! Get me in!"

The submersible materialized out of the murk, its floodlights blazing,
and Coretti grabbed the airlock rail and hauled himself inside with all
the grace of a man falling up a flight of stairs. Dex sealed the lock
and hit the thrusters, and the _Barracuda_ lurched away from the alien
vessel.

Coretti pulled off his helmet and looked at the sonar display. The
fleet was lighting up. Not all of it -- not yet -- but the EM
signatures from the large vessels had tripled in intensity, and the
smaller ships, the escorts, were showing thermal signatures that
had not been there ten minutes ago. The ship he had entered was now
radiating heat from its stern section -- its engines were warming up.

Fourteen capital ships. Thirty escorts. An alien fleet, buried in ice
at the bottom of Europa's ocean for God knew how many millennia, and
Max Coretti had walked in and turned on the lights.

"Salvage rights," Dex said flatly. "You were going to file salvage
rights."

Coretti stared at the sonar display. The fleet was waking up. The
largest vessel -- five hundred meters of dark, smooth hull, bigger
than anything humanity had ever built to sail between the stars -- was
beginning to shift in its ice cradle, its thermal output melting the
substrate that had held it in place for eons.

"Change of plan," Coretti said.

"You think?"

"Get us to the surface. Fast. We need to call the Confederation."

"I've been saying that for twenty minutes!"

"Yeah, well, I'm a slow learner."

Dex threw the _Barracuda_ into a full-power ascent. The submersible
shuddered and climbed, its hull groaning under the changing pressure,
and behind them, on the ocean floor, the sunken fleet stirred.

Coretti lit a cigar and watched the sonar. The fleet was moving now --
slowly, agonizingly slowly, the way something moves when it has been
asleep for a very long time and is not yet fully awake. But it was
moving.

"Dex."

"What?"

"What do you think they were doing down there?"

"Sleeping."

"Sure. But what were they doing before they were sleeping?"

Dex did not answer. He did not need to. The ships were warships. Their
design, their formation, their armament -- the weapons ports that
Coretti had noticed on the smaller vessel's hull and chosen not to
think about -- all pointed to a single purpose. They were built to
fight. They had come to Europa, or been sent to Europa, or fled to
Europa, at some point in the distant past. They had sunk to the bottom
of the ocean and been covered in ice and they had waited.

And now they were waking up.

"How about this," Coretti said. "How about we worry about that later
and focus on the part where we get to the surface before the alien
navy decides to form up?"

"Best idea you've had all day."

The _Barracuda_ climbed. Behind them, the darkness stirred. And
somewhere in the cold, black water at the bottom of Europa's sea,
something very old and very large opened its eyes.

                            [THE END]

                    FORKING PATHS

                         by Oscar Lennox

================================================================================

                               I.

The device was housed in a room with no windows, which struck Dr.
Julian Cross as appropriate. Windows implied a relationship with the
outside world -- a fixed perspective, a single vantage point from which
reality could be observed. The device, by its nature, dissolved all
fixed perspectives. It made windows irrelevant.

He had been given access to it on a Tuesday in November, after three
years of applications, security clearances, and interviews with men in
gray suits who asked the same questions in different order and recorded
his answers with the meticulous dispassion of bureaucrats cataloging
something they did not understand. The Project -- it had no other name,
at least none that anyone used in his presence -- was classified at a
level that existed, as far as Cross could determine, specifically to
classify this and nothing else. The security apparatus surrounding it
was baroque, redundant, and, he suspected, largely performative.

The real security was simpler: the device was difficult to explain, and
what could not be explained could not be leaked.

Cross was a historian. He was fifty-one years old, a professor of
Modern European History at Columbia University, the author of six books
on the political origins of the First World War, and a man who had
spent his entire career asking a question that history, by its nature,
could not answer: What would have happened if things had gone
differently?

The device could answer it.

He understood the physics only in the most general terms. Something
about quantum decoherence and the branching structure of the wave
function -- the many-worlds interpretation made literal, made
technological, made into a machine that could, for want of a better
metaphor, tune into the radio stations of parallel reality. The
physicists who had built it described its output as "observational
data from adjacent probability manifolds," which Cross translated,
in the privacy of his own mind, as: the device lets you see what
happened in the worlds where things went the other way.

The room was underground, beneath a building on a military base that
Cross had been driven to blindfolded -- another piece of performative
security that he had endured with the patience of a man who has spent
three years filling out forms. The device itself was unimpressive: a
cabinet of electronic equipment, roughly the size of an upright piano,
connected by cables to a display screen that looked like an ordinary
television set. A swivel chair had been placed before the screen, and
a console with a single dial and a row of switches sat on a small table
beside it.

Dr. Evelyn Rhodes, the project physicist assigned to supervise his
sessions, was a compact, efficient woman in her forties who wore her
hair in a severe bun and spoke in the clipped cadences of someone
who has explained a complex thing too many times.

"The dial selects the divergence point," she said. "You specify a
historical moment -- a decision, an event, a turning point -- and the
device locates the nearest probability manifold in which that moment
resolved differently. The screen displays the outcome. You can observe
approximately six hours of elapsed time per session, at variable rates
of compression."

"Six hours of history?"

"Six hours of observational time. The history you observe may span
minutes or centuries, depending on the rate of compression you select.
Think of it as watching a film. You can watch at normal speed, or you
can fast-forward."

"What determines which alternate timeline I see? If the Battle of
Gettysburg goes differently, there must be millions of possible
variations."

"Trillions," Rhodes corrected. "The device selects the nearest
adjacent manifold -- the timeline that diverges from ours at the
specified point with the minimum quantum distance. In practical terms,
it shows you the most probable alternative."

"The most probable."

"Yes. Not the most dramatic or the most interesting. The most probable.
The timeline that deviates least from our own while still incorporating
the specified divergence."

Cross sat in the swivel chair and looked at the blank screen. "What if
I want to see a less probable alternative?"

"You adjust the dial. Clockwise increases the quantum distance --
further from our timeline, less probable alternatives. But I should
warn you: the further you go from our timeline, the less meaningful the
observations become. At extreme quantum distances, the divergences
compound to the point where the alternate reality bears no recognizable
relationship to our own. We call it 'going deep.' The researchers who
went deep in the early trials found it... disorienting."

"Disorienting how?"

Rhodes paused, and Cross saw something cross her face -- not fear,
exactly, but a wariness that suggested she was choosing her words with
care. "The human mind is adapted to a single timeline. We process
reality as a sequence of events, each one following inevitably from the
last. The device shows you that nothing is inevitable. That every
moment is a branching point. That the life you are living is one of an
uncountable number of lives you could be living, and that there is
nothing -- no law of physics, no principle of history, no act of God --
that makes your timeline more real or more valid than any other."

She looked at him. "Some people find that liberating. Some people find
it unbearable. The early researchers called it 'the vertigo.'"

"The vertigo of infinite possibility."

"Yes."

"I'll manage," Cross said. "I've spent my career imagining alternate
timelines. I've just never been able to see them."

"Imagining is different from seeing," Rhodes said. "You'll understand
that soon enough."

                               II.

He began with Sarajevo.

It was the obvious choice -- the event that had defined his career, the
moment that had launched the catastrophe of the twentieth century.
June 28, 1914. Archduke Franz Ferdinand's motorcade in Sarajevo. The
wrong turn. The sandwich shop. Gavrilo Princip. Two shots.

Cross specified the divergence point: Princip does not fire. The
driver does not take the wrong turn. The Archduke's car proceeds along
the original route, and the assassin, waiting on the wrong street, sees
nothing. The motorcade passes. Franz Ferdinand lives.

He turned the dial to the nearest adjacent manifold and pressed the
activation switch.

The screen flickered. Static, briefly -- then an image resolved, and
Cross leaned forward in his chair.

He was looking at a street in Sarajevo. The same street, the same
buildings, the same June sunlight falling on the same cobblestones. A
motorcade was passing -- open cars, military escorts, flags. In the
second car, a tall man in a plumed hat sat beside a woman in white.
Franz Ferdinand and Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg. Alive. Passing
through Sarajevo without incident, waving to the crowds, continuing
their tour of Bosnia.

Cross felt his breath catch. He had spent twenty-three years studying
the consequences of this man's death, and here he was, alive, on a
screen, in a timeline where the shot was never fired.

He pressed the compression control and watched the weeks unspool.
Franz Ferdinand returned to Vienna. The crisis over the assassination
attempt -- there had still been an attempt, by another conspirator
earlier in the day -- produced diplomatic tensions but no ultimatum.
Austria-Hungary did not declare war on Serbia. Russia did not mobilize.
Germany did not activate the Schlieffen Plan. France was not invaded.
Belgium was not violated. Britain did not enter the war.

There was no war.

Cross watched a year pass in compressed time, then two, then five.
Europe without the Great War was recognizable but different -- the
empires endured, the old order persisted, the revolutions that had
been born in the trenches did not occur. Russia did not fall to the
Bolsheviks. Germany did not collapse into hyperinflation and resentment.
The social upheavals that had reshaped the world -- women's suffrage,
the fall of aristocracy, the birth of modern mass politics -- happened
differently, more slowly, in different forms.

He watched a decade. Two decades. Three. By the 1940s, the divergence
was profound. A Europe of aging empires, still ruled by monarchs and
aristocrats, technologically advanced but politically stagnant. No
Hitler -- without the trauma of the war and the humiliation of
Versailles, the conditions that had produced fascism did not exist.
No Stalin -- without the revolution, Russia remained a constitutional
monarchy under the Romanovs, reformed but recognizable. No Second
World War. No Holocaust. No atomic bomb.

Cross stared at the screen. A world without the trenches. A world
without the camps. A world without Hiroshima. Hundreds of millions of
people who had died in his timeline, alive in this one.

He reached for the notepad he had brought and found that his hand was
trembling.

                               * * *

He spent the rest of his first session watching the no-war timeline
unfold through the twentieth century. It was, by almost every
measurable standard, a better world. Not a paradise -- there were
conflicts, injustices, famines, epidemics. The empires suppressed
colonial independence movements with varying degrees of brutality. The
technological development that had been accelerated by two world wars
was slower in this timeline -- no jet engines, no radar, no computers
by mid-century. But the sheer absence of catastrophic violence made
the comparison stark.

By the end of the session -- six hours of observational time,
compressed to cover nearly a century -- Cross was exhausted, exhilarated,
and haunted. He had seen a world that was better than his own. Not
dramatically, not utopically, but measurably, undeniably better. Fewer
dead. Less suffering. More continuity. A world where the twentieth
century was not defined by the mass production of death.

And all it had taken was a driver who did not take a wrong turn on a
street in Sarajevo.

He walked out of the underground room and into the November air and
stood for a long time, looking up at a sky that seemed, somehow, less
fixed than it had that morning.

                               III.

He returned the next day, and the next, and the next. The Project
allowed him three sessions per week, each six hours long, and Cross
used every minute.

He explored the American Civil War: a timeline where the Battle of
Antietam was a decisive Confederate victory, leading to British and
French recognition of the Confederacy and a negotiated peace. Two
Americas, side by side, one slave and one free. The consequences were
appalling. He watched the slave-holding nation persist into the
twentieth century, its economy industrializing around forced labor,
its ideology hardening into something that made the Jim Crow South
look moderate. He stopped watching after three sessions.

He explored the Reformation: a timeline where Martin Luther died of
plague in 1517 before posting his theses. Catholic Europe endured,
unified and powerful, but the absence of the Reformation's intellectual
disruption produced a continent that was more stable and more stagnant.
The Enlightenment, when it came, was different -- more gradual, more
accommodated by the Church, less revolutionary. By the twentieth
century, this timeline was behind his own in political liberalism but
ahead in artistic achievement. The calculus of comparison was maddeningly
complex.

He explored the fall of Constantinople, the Spanish Armada, the
French Revolution, the invention of the printing press. Each
divergence point opened a new timeline, and each timeline was a world
complete in itself -- populated by billions of people who had lived
and died and loved and suffered in a reality that was, from their
perspective, the only one that existed.

And each time, Cross found himself performing the same calculation:
which world was better? Which timeline produced more human flourishing,
less human suffering? Was there a best timeline -- an optimal sequence
of historical events that, if only the right decisions had been made at
the right moments, would have produced the best of all possible worlds?

The question consumed him.

                               * * *

By the third week, he had developed a methodology. He created a
scoring system -- a set of metrics by which he could evaluate and
compare timelines. Population. Life expectancy. Literacy. Political
freedom (measured, imperfectly, by a rubric he had adapted from his
own scholarship). Technological development. Artistic output. The
metrics were crude, and Cross knew they were crude, but they gave him
a framework for comparison, and comparison was the thing he could not
stop doing.

He filled notebook after notebook with his evaluations. Timeline 1A
(no Sarajevo assassination): overall score 847 out of a possible 1,000.
Timeline 2C (Confederate victory at Antietam): 412. Timeline 3B
(Luther dies young): 731. Timeline 5A (Napoleon wins at Waterloo): 623.
Timeline 7D (Rome does not fall): 788.

He graphed them. He plotted the scores against the divergence points,
looking for patterns. Which types of changes produced the largest
improvements? Which historical events, if altered, had the greatest
positive impact on human welfare?

The patterns emerged slowly, but they emerged. The most important
divergence points were not the ones he had expected. The assassination
of an archduke or the outcome of a battle mattered less, in aggregate,
than the invention of a technology or the survival of a particular
institution. The timelines where the Library of Alexandria was not
destroyed scored consistently higher than those where it was, regardless
of other variations. The timelines where smallpox vaccination was
developed a century early were dramatically better across every metric.
The timelines where the printing press was invented in China in the
eighth century instead of Germany in the fifteenth were -- surprisingly
-- not consistently better, because the earlier spread of information
also meant the earlier spread of certain destructive ideologies.

History, Cross was discovering, was not a story with better and worse
versions. It was a system of such staggering complexity that the
relationship between cause and effect was, at sufficient scale,
essentially chaotic. A change that improved one metric degraded another.
A divergence that prevented one catastrophe enabled a different one. The
best timelines were not the ones where the right things happened; they
were the ones where the wrong things happened in the right order, where
catastrophes were spaced far enough apart for recovery, where the
random clustering of good and bad events happened to fall in a pattern
that allowed, by sheer combinatorial luck, slightly more flourishing
than suffering.

There was no best timeline. There was no optimal path. There was only
the vast, branching, incomprehensible forest of possibility, and every
path through it was lit and shadowed in roughly equal measure.

Cross knew this. He wrote it in his notebooks. He underlined it,
circled it, drew arrows pointing to it. He knew it the way a
mathematician knows a proof: as an established fact, derived from
evidence, resistant to refutation.

And still he could not stop looking.

                               IV.

Rhodes noticed the change in him before he noticed it himself.

"You're spending too much time in there," she said. It was the sixth
week. Cross had increased his sessions to the maximum allowed -- three
per week, six hours each -- and he was arriving early and leaving late,
sitting in the underground room with his notebooks, reviewing his
observations, refining his scoring system, searching.

"I'm doing research," he said.

"You're doing something. I've supervised eleven researchers on this
project, Dr. Cross. I know what the early stages look like. Excitement,
curiosity, systematic exploration. I also know what the later stages
look like."

"And what do the later stages look like?"

"Obsession. The conviction that there is a best timeline. The
compulsion to find it. The researchers who go down that path always
end up in the same place."

"Where?"

Rhodes looked at him with the flat, careful expression of a scientist
delivering bad news. "Staring at their own lives."

Cross did not respond. He did not respond because Rhodes was right,
and he had not yet admitted it to himself, and the admission, when it
came, arrived with the force of something that had been true for a long
time but had been hiding in the margins of his awareness, waiting to
be acknowledged.

He had been looking at history. He had been looking at Sarajevo and
Antietam and the Library of Alexandria. But what he had really been
looking for, beneath all the grand historical divergences, was the
divergence point in his own life. The moment when things could have
gone differently. The decision he had made -- or not made -- that had
led to the life he was living instead of the life he could have been
living.

He had been looking for the timeline where he had not lost Catherine.

                               * * *

Catherine Bell Cross. His wife. His former wife. They had married in
1931, when he was twenty-eight and she was twenty-five, and they had
been happy in the way that two intelligent, stubborn, passionate people
are happy: intensely, argumentatively, with a force that was as
exhausting as it was sustaining. She was a novelist. He was a historian.
They had fought about everything -- politics, dinner, the arrangement
of books on shelves -- and they had loved each other with the same
ferocity with which they argued.

They had divorced in 1942. The reasons were complex, as the reasons for
a divorce always are, but Cross had reduced them, over the years of
retrospective analysis that divorced people inflict upon themselves, to
a single moment. A single decision. A single divergence point.

In September 1941, he had been offered a position at a university in
London. It was a prestigious appointment -- a chair in modern history,
with a generous research budget and the opportunity to work with the
British archives that were essential to his scholarship. Catherine had
wanted to go. She had wanted to go to London, to live in a different
city, to write her novels in a new landscape. She had wanted to go, and
he had said no.

He had said no because America was about to enter the war, and London
was being bombed, and he had a perfectly good position at Columbia, and
the move would have been impractical, inconvenient, and dangerous.
These were rational reasons. They were good reasons. They were the
reasons he had given Catherine, and they were true.

But they were not the real reason. The real reason was simpler and less
admirable: he was afraid. Afraid of the change, afraid of the
uncertainty, afraid of losing the life he had built -- the routines,
the colleagues, the familiar streets of Morningside Heights -- for
something that was unknown and therefore threatening. He had chosen
safety over possibility, and Catherine, who had spent her life
choosing possibility over safety, had looked at him and seen something
she could not love: a man whose fear was stronger than his desire.

She left him three months later. She moved to London alone, and she
wrote her best novel there, and she married a British journalist, and
Cross had spent the next decade pretending that the divorce was mutual
and the next decade after that admitting that it was not.

He sat in the underground room and he looked at the device and he
thought about September 1941, and he knew what he was going to do.

                               V.

He specified the divergence point: September 1941. Julian Cross accepts
the London position. He and Catherine move to England.

The screen flickered. Static. Then an image: a flat in Bloomsbury,
books on every surface, a typewriter by the window. Catherine at the
typewriter, her dark hair pinned up, her fingers moving. Cross standing
behind her, reading over her shoulder, smiling.

They were happy.

Cross watched the timeline unfold with the meticulous attention of a
historian and the anguished attention of a man watching the life he
had failed to live. In this timeline, they survived the war together --
the bombing was terrifying, but the shared danger drew them closer
instead of driving them apart. He published his first book in London,
to strong reviews. She published her novel -- the same novel she had
written in his timeline, or nearly the same -- and it was received even
better, because in this timeline she was happier, and the happiness
made her work braver.

They had a child. A daughter. Born in 1944, named Eleanor, after
Catherine's mother. Cross watched the girl grow in compressed time --
an infant, a toddler, a child with Catherine's dark hair and his own
serious eyes. The family moved to a larger flat in Hampstead. They
traveled. They fought -- still fought, because they were still
themselves -- but the fights resolved into reconciliation instead of
resentment, because in this timeline the fundamental trust between
them had not been broken.

Cross watched himself age. The other Cross -- the Cross who had said
yes instead of no -- grew older in the screen with the serene assurance
of a man who had taken the risk and been rewarded. He was the same man
and a different man. The same intelligence, the same stubborn
dedication to his work, but with something added -- a warmth, an
openness, that Cross recognized as the quality that Catherine had
always wanted him to have and that he had always been too frightened to
develop.

He watched until the six hours were exhausted, and then he sat in the
dark room and cried.

                               * * *

He came back the next session and watched more. He watched the
alternate Cross raise his daughter. He watched the alternate Catherine
write four more novels, each one better than the last. He watched the
alternate family vacation in the south of France, celebrate Christmas
in the Hampstead flat, argue about politics at the dinner table while
Eleanor rolled her eyes with the long-suffering patience of a teenager
whose parents were intellectuals.

He watched the alternate Cross receive an honor from the British
Academy. He watched the alternate Catherine die, at sixty-seven, of the
same cancer that had killed her in his timeline -- some things, it
seemed, were invariant across probability manifolds. He watched the
alternate Cross grieve, supported by his daughter and his grandchildren
and the accumulated wealth of a life fully lived.

He watched, and he scored. The alternate timeline was better. Not by
every metric -- his academic output was lower in the London timeline,
his scholarly influence somewhat diminished by his distance from the
American academic establishment. But by the metrics that mattered --
happiness, connection, the depth and richness of a human life -- the
alternate timeline was overwhelmingly, crushingly, undeniably better.

And all it had taken was saying yes instead of no on a September
afternoon in 1941.

                               VI.

Rhodes found him in the room at the end of his eighth week, sitting in
the dark, the screen blank, his notebooks open on his lap.

"You looked at your own life," she said. It was not a question.

"Yes."

"And you found a better version."

"Yes."

She sat down in the chair beside him. "They all do. Every researcher.
Every single one. They come in to study history, and they end up
studying themselves, and they find a timeline where they were happier.
It's not a coincidence. The branching structure of reality guarantees
it. For every life, there are adjacent lives that went better. The
device shows you the nearest one. And the nearest better life is always
close -- always just one decision away, one small change, one moment
of courage or honesty or luck that you didn't have in this timeline but
did have in another."

"That's the vertigo," Cross said.

"That's the vertigo. The realization that your life -- the one you're
actually living -- is not the best version of your life. That there is
a version of you, as real as you are, who made a different choice at a
critical moment and was rewarded for it. And that you cannot reach that
timeline. You can see it, but you cannot enter it. You are trapped in
the life you chose, and the device shows you, in perfect detail, the
life you did not."

Cross looked at his notebooks. Pages and pages of scores, metrics,
evaluations. The careful, systematic assessment of which timeline was
best, applied to the grandest events in human history and, finally,
inevitably, to the smallest event in his own: a decision about a job
offer, made in an apartment in Morningside Heights, thirteen years ago.

"Is there a cure?" he asked. He meant it as a joke, but it came out
sincere.

"Yes," Rhodes said. "Stop looking."

"I can't."

"I know."

They sat in the dark, and Cross thought about the branching garden of
possibility that extended from every moment of every life, and he
thought about the version of himself who had said yes, and he thought
about the daughter he had never had, and he wondered whether, in some
adjacent probability manifold, there was a version of this moment --
this exact moment, in this underground room, in this dark -- where he
found the strength to stand up and walk away from the machine and go
back to the life he had, imperfect and singular and his.

He wondered. But he did not move.

And the branching paths extended outward, and outward, and outward,
and each one was real, and each one was lived, and in the garden of
forking paths there was no gardener, no plan, no best route through
the maze -- only the paths themselves, diverging and converging and
diverging again, forever, into a complexity that no device could fully
display and no human mind could fully comprehend.

Julian Cross sat in his chair, and he did not move, and the screen
waited, blank and patient, for him to choose what to look at next.

He already knew what it would be.

It would be September 1941, again. The same moment, the same decision,
the same woman at the door with her suitcase, asking him to come.

He would watch himself say yes. Again. And again. And again.

Because the device could show him every path, every possibility, every
version of his life that might have been -- but it could not give him
the one thing he wanted, which was not information but absolution. Not
the knowledge of what he should have done, but the forgiveness for
what he did.

And that, Cross understood, was not a function the machine could
perform.

That was a human problem, requiring a human solution, available in
every timeline, including this one.

He reached for the dial.

He paused.

He sat in the dark, and the garden forked around him, and he was still.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        SANDCASTLE EMPIRES

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

The trick was to start building the moment the light changed.

Mira knew this better than anyone on the strip. She was twelve years
old, small for her age, with quick hands and dark eyes that watched the
sky the way a sailor watches the horizon -- not for beauty, but for
information. On Thessaly, information about the sky was the difference
between finishing your castle and watching it melt.

Thessaly was a tidally locked world, which meant that one side always
faced its star and the other side always faced the dark. The dayside was
a furnace -- temperatures that could soften metal, winds that could
strip paint off a hull. The nightside was a freezer -- so cold that
the atmosphere itself condensed into frost on the rocks. Between the
two was the terminator: a strip of land, roughly two hundred kilometers
wide, where the temperature was bearable and the light was permanent
twilight. Everyone on Thessaly lived on the terminator. There was
nowhere else to live.

The settlement was called Haven, and it was a modest place: three
hundred souls, mostly miners and support personnel for the chromium
extraction operation that was Thessaly's reason for existing. The
buildings were prefabricated modules, bolted to the rock, with thermal
shielding on the dayside walls and insulation on the nightside walls.
The streets -- if you could call them streets -- ran parallel to the
terminator, east to west, so that you could walk from one end of town
to the other without crossing into the zones where the temperature
would kill you.

And at the western edge of Haven, where the twilight deepened toward
the nightside and the ground was covered in a fine, crystalline sand
that the wind deposited in drifts and ridges, the children built their
castles.

The sand was special. It was not sand in the terrestrial sense -- not
weathered rock, not silica. It was condensate: atmospheric compounds
that had precipitated out of the air at the terminator's temperature
gradient, forming tiny, regular crystals that packed together like
grains of sugar. When you wet it -- and you could wet it, because
there was moisture in the twilight air, drawn from the dayside by
convection -- it became malleable, sculpt-able, almost claylike in its
responsiveness. You could shape it into walls, towers, arches, domes.
You could carve it with your fingernails. You could build structures
of startling delicacy and complexity.

But the sand had a flaw, and the flaw was what made the building both
urgent and heartbreaking. The crystals were metastable. They held their
shape for exactly as long as the temperature held steady -- roughly
four hours, during the period that the children called "the window,"
when the thermal gradient was at its most stable and the sand crystals
maintained their structure. Before the window, the sand was too warm
and too soft. After the window, the temperature shifted by a fraction
of a degree, the crystal lattice destabilized, and everything you had
built collapsed into powder.

Four hours. That was what you had. Four hours to build a city, a
fortress, a cathedral, a world. And then it was gone.

                               * * *

Mira had been building since she was seven. Her mother, Consuela, was
a mining engineer who worked twelve-hour shifts at the chromium
extraction site. Her father was not discussed. Mira spent her days in
the settlement's one-room school and her evenings on the sand strip,
where the children gathered during the window to build.

She was the best builder in Haven. Everyone knew it. The other children
were good -- some of them very good, capable of constructing castles
with moats and battlements and towers that reached a meter high before
the window closed. But Mira's castles were different. Mira's castles
were not just structures. They were cities.

She built them in miniature, with streets and plazas and parks and
buildings that had doors and windows and, if you looked closely, tiny
furnishings inside. She built aqueducts that carried real water from
the condensation pools. She built bridges that spanned the gaps between
dunes. She built walls with crenellations and gates that opened and
closed on hinges made of crystallized sand so fine they were almost
invisible.

The other children gathered around her constructions and stared. Even
the adults, walking past on their way to the evening shift, would
stop and look. There was something about Mira's cities that was more
than craftsmanship. They had a quality -- a rightness, a coherence --
that made them feel not like models of imaginary places but like scale
reproductions of places that actually existed, somewhere, in some world
that Mira could see and the rest of them could not.

"Where do you get the designs?" her friend Tomás asked her one evening,
crouching beside a particularly elaborate construction -- a walled
city with a central tower, built on a sand ridge overlooking the
nightside. The city had taken Mira three hours and forty minutes of
the four-hour window, and it was the most complex thing she had ever
built.

Mira shrugged. "I see them."

"See them where?"

"In my head. I see the city, and then I build it."

"But where does the city come from? Do you plan it out beforehand?"

Mira shook her head. "It just comes. When I start building, I know
what goes where. Like I'm remembering it instead of inventing it."

Tomás looked at the city. Its streets radiated from the central tower
in a spiral pattern, and the buildings along each street grew smaller
as they approached the outer wall, creating a perspective effect that
made the city look larger than it was. Small figures -- human figures,
or something like them -- stood in the plazas and sat on the benches
and walked along the tiny streets. Mira had shaped them from damp sand
with her fingertips, each one no larger than a grain of rice.

"It looks real," Tomás said.

"It is real," Mira said. "For now."

They both looked at the sky. The window was closing. In twenty minutes,
the temperature would shift, and the city would crumble.

                               * * *

The first time the castle predicted something, Mira did not recognize
it as prediction.

She was nine years old, building on the sand strip during a window
that was unusually long -- four hours and twenty minutes, which
happened sometimes when the atmospheric circulation patterns aligned.
She built a mining complex: tunnels, processing buildings, a rail line
that carried imaginary ore from the tunnels to a loading dock. It was
a good construction, detailed and functional-looking, and she was
proud of it.

Three days later, the real mining complex experienced a tunnel collapse.
Section Seven, the newest tunnel, caved in during a routine extraction
shift. No one was killed -- the safety protocols worked as designed --
but the tunnel was destroyed, and the processing schedule was disrupted
for two weeks.

Mira did not think about the connection. Why would she? Children built
sandcastles. Mining complexes had tunnel collapses. There was no
relationship between these things.

The second time, she noticed.

She was ten. She built a city with a central plaza dominated by a
fountain -- an ambitious construction, the fountain, requiring a small
reservoir of condensation water and channels carved with painstaking
precision. The fountain worked for about twenty minutes, a thin stream
of water arching from a tiny nozzle and falling into a basin that Mira
had shaped like a bowl. Then the sand at the fountain's base eroded,
the structure tilted, and the water spilled out across the plaza,
flooding the surrounding streets and dissolving the buildings closest
to the center.

The next week, a pipe burst in Haven's central water recycling plant.
The resulting flood damaged the settlement's main storage depot and
four residential modules. Fourteen families had to be relocated
while repairs were made.

Mira stared at the damage report, posted on the school's notice board,
and felt something cold move through her chest. The damage pattern --
the buildings closest to the center, the outward spread, the specific
sequence of structures affected -- was identical to what had happened
to her sandcastle when the fountain collapsed.

Identical.

She told no one. What would she say? My sandcastle predicted a pipe
burst? She was ten. She knew how that would sound.

But she started paying attention.

                               * * *

Over the next two years, Mira tracked the correlations with the
careful, silent attention of a child who has discovered something that
adults would not believe. She built her cities during the window, and
she watched what happened to them -- not just the grand collapse at the
end, when the temperature shifted and everything fell, but the small
events during the construction. A wall that cracked. A tower that
leaned. A street that subsided. An arch that held longer than it should
have.

And then she watched Haven.

The correlations were not exact. They were not one-to-one. A cracked
wall in a sandcastle did not always correspond to a cracked wall in the
settlement. But the patterns were there, if you knew how to look. A
structural failure in the sandcastle's western quarter preceded a
structural failure in Haven's western quarter. A successful aqueduct in
the model preceded a successful repair to the settlement's water
system. A tower that stood unusually long predicted a stretch of
stable weather.

The sand, Mira began to understand, was not just a building material.
It was a medium. The crystals that formed at the terminator's
temperature gradient were sensitive to forces that she could not name
and did not understand -- forces that influenced the way the sand
packed, the way the structures held, the way the tiny, metastable
crystal lattice responded to the pressure of her hands. The sand was
recording something. The structures she built from it were not
inventions. They were transcriptions.

She was not building the future. She was reading it.

                               * * *

The day she built the disaster was the day everything changed.

She was twelve. The window opened at its usual time, and Mira went to
the sand strip with her tools -- a flat stick for shaping walls, a
thin wire for carving windows, a small bottle of condensation water
for wetting the sand. She knelt at her usual spot, at the base of the
largest dune, and began to build.

The city came fast. Faster than usual, as if the design was urgent,
demanding to be realized. Her hands moved with a precision that felt
automatic, as if someone else was guiding them. Walls rose. Streets
formed. Buildings took shape with a speed and complexity that startled
her.

But the city was wrong.

Not wrong in its construction -- the construction was flawless,
the most technically accomplished thing she had ever built. Wrong
in its content. The city she was building was Haven -- recognizably,
unmistakably Haven. The same layout, the same building positions,
the same streets running east to west along the terminator. She could
identify specific structures: the school, the medical module, her
mother's residential block, the mining administration building.

And in the city's eastern quarter, where the chromium extraction
complex met the settlement's thermal shielding, there was a crack.

Not a small crack. A fracture that ran from the base of the shielding
wall through the foundation of the processing plant and into the
rock beneath. A crack that, in the sandcastle, would cause the
eastern quarter to collapse inward, taking the processing plant and
the residential modules behind it.

Mira stared at it. Her hands were trembling. She had not decided to
build this. She had not planned it. The sand had shaped itself under
her fingers, and what it had shaped was a warning.

She looked at the sky. Ninety minutes of the window remained. In
ninety minutes, the sandcastle would collapse, and the prediction
would be sealed. But the event it predicted -- the real event, the
one that would happen in Haven -- might not occur for days. Or it
might occur tomorrow.

She stood up and ran.

                               * * *

Her mother was on shift. Mira went to the mining administration
building and found the duty supervisor, a man named Kowalski who had
a gray mustache and a permanent squint from twenty years of working
in the twilight.

"I need to talk to you about the eastern thermal shielding," Mira
said.

Kowalski looked at her. She was twelve. She was covered in sand. She
was breathing hard from running.

"The thermal shielding," he repeated.

"There's a fracture. In the foundation. Where the shielding meets the
processing plant foundation. It runs into the bedrock."

"How do you know this?"

Mira hesitated. She could not tell him about the sandcastle. She could
not explain that she had read the future in a construction made of
crystallized atmospheric condensate on a sand strip at the edge of
town. She was twelve. She knew how that would sound.

"I saw it," she said. "I was walking near the eastern quarter and I
saw a crack in the shielding base."

Kowalski frowned. "The thermal shielding is inspected every six months.
Last inspection was two months ago. No fractures reported."

"It's there. Please. Just look."

Something in her voice -- the urgency, the conviction, the absolute
certainty that only a child can project because a child has not yet
learned to doubt her own perceptions -- made Kowalski pause. He looked
at her for a long moment, and then he picked up his comm unit and
called the maintenance team.

"Send someone to check the eastern thermal shielding," he said.
"Foundation level. Look for fractures."

The maintenance team found the crack forty-five minutes later. It was
exactly where Mira had said it would be: a hairline fracture in the
foundation of the thermal shielding wall, running diagonally through
the concrete and into the basalt bedrock beneath. It was not visible
from the surface. The maintenance crew found it using a subsurface
scanner, and when they saw the readings, they called Kowalski, and
Kowalski called the settlement director, and the settlement director
called an emergency meeting.

The crack was serious. Left unrepaired, it would propagate through
the foundation over a period of weeks, weakening the thermal shielding
until it failed. When it failed, the dayside heat would penetrate the
eastern quarter -- processing plant, residential modules, school. The
temperatures involved would be lethal.

They evacuated the eastern quarter that night. Repairs took three
weeks. The settlement director, in her report to the colonial
authority, credited "an observant young resident" with identifying the
threat before it became a catastrophe.

Mira's mother hugged her and asked her how she had known. Mira said she
had been walking and she had seen a crack and she had reported it. This
was technically true. She had seen a crack. In a sandcastle.

She went back to the sand strip the next evening. The window opened.
The sand waited, crystalline and patient and full of information that
Mira did not understand but could not deny.

She knelt, and she built.

                               * * *

The castles continued. Mira built during every window, and she watched
what the sand told her, and she kept her silence. The predictions were
not always dramatic -- sometimes the sandcastle showed a minor
equipment failure, a supply delay, a weather pattern. Sometimes it
showed nothing at all, and the city she built was beautiful and
uneventful, and Haven had a quiet week.

She began to understand the rhythm. The sand was not omniscient. It
did not show the distant future or events beyond the settlement. It
showed what was local, what was imminent, what was already taking shape
in the physical systems -- geological, mechanical, atmospheric -- that
governed life on the terminator. The sand crystals were sensitive to
vibrations, pressures, thermal gradients that human instruments were
too coarse to detect. They were, in a sense, the most precise sensors
on the planet, and Mira's hands were the interface.

She was twelve years old, and she could read the future in sand, and
the future lasted four hours before it turned to dust.

She did not tell anyone. She did not need to. The castles were enough.
She built them, and she watched them, and she carried what they told
her in the quiet space inside her chest where children keep the things
that are too large and too strange for words.

And when the window closed, and the temperature shifted, and the
cities crumbled into powder, Mira watched them fall with the steady
gaze of someone who understood that nothing built on Thessaly was
meant to last -- not the castles, not the settlement, not the mining
operation, not the brief human presence on a world that had existed
for billions of years without them and would exist for billions more
after they were gone.

But you built anyway. That was the thing. You knew it wouldn't last,
and you built anyway, because the building was the point. Not the
permanence. The act. The four hours of concentrated, urgent, joyful
creation, knowing that the window would close and the sand would fall
and tomorrow you would start again.

Mira knelt on the sand strip at the edge of Haven, and the twilight
was steady, and the crystals were patient, and her hands were quick,
and she built.

                         BENEATH THE RUST

                        by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

Della found the factory on a Tuesday in October, when the light was the
color of old brass and the wind carried the smell of rust.

She had been walking the ruins since dawn, which was what she did. That
was her work -- if you could call it work, if there was still a word
for the thing you did every day to keep yourself and the people who
depended on you alive. She walked the ruins. She looked for things that
could be used. She brought them back.

The ruins stretched for miles in every direction. They had been a city,
once -- a real city, with buildings that had roofs and windows that had
glass and streets that had names. Della did not know the city's name.
The signs had rusted away decades before she was born, and the old
people who might have remembered were dead, and no one who was alive
now had the time or the inclination to care about names. The city was
the ruins. The ruins were the world. That was enough.

She was thirty-one years old, though she looked older. Everyone looked
older. The sun aged you fast when there was no shade, and the wind
aged you faster, and the work -- the endless, grinding, daily work of
survival -- aged you fastest of all. She was thin, strong in the way
that people who carry heavy things are strong, with calloused hands and
a face that had been weathered into something beyond prettiness or
plainness, into the hard, clear expression of a person who had no
energy to waste on appearance.

She carried a canvas sack over one shoulder and a pry bar in her right
hand. The pry bar was the most valuable thing she owned. It was forged
steel, solid, and it could open doors, shift rubble, pry sheets of
metal off collapsed structures. She had found it three years ago in the
basement of a building that had once been, she guessed from the
remaining fixtures, a hardware store. It was the best find she had
ever made. Until today.

                               * * *

The factory was underground.

She found it because the floor gave way.

She was working a section of ruins she had not explored before -- the
eastern edge of the city, where the industrial buildings were larger
and more heavily constructed, their steel frames still standing even
after a century of weather. Most of them had been picked clean by
scavengers before her. The easy stuff -- copper wire, aluminum
sheeting, glass, anything that could be repurposed -- had been taken
decades ago. What remained was the heavy infrastructure: concrete
foundations, steel beams, cast-iron pipes. Things that were too big to
move and too common to be worth the effort.

But Della had learned that the heavy stuff sometimes hid the valuable
stuff. A concrete floor could cover a basement. A steel beam could
block a doorway that led to an untouched room. The ruins were layered,
like sediment, and the deeper you went, the more likely you were to
find something that the earlier scavengers had missed.

She was crossing the floor of what had been a large industrial building
-- a warehouse, maybe, or a manufacturing plant -- when the concrete
beneath her right foot crumbled. She felt it give, a soft, grinding
sensation like stepping on rotten ice, and she threw herself sideways,
dropping her sack and clutching at a rusted beam as the floor opened
beneath her in a cascade of broken concrete and corroded rebar.

The hole was about three meters across. Dust rose from it in a thick
plume, and Della coughed and pressed her face against her sleeve and
waited for it to clear. When it did, she leaned over the edge and
looked down.

Below the floor, perhaps four meters down, there was another floor.
And on that floor, in the dim light that filtered through the hole,
she could see machines.

Not ruins of machines. Not rusted hulks, not collapsed frameworks, not
the corroded skeletons of equipment that had died a century ago. These
machines were intact. Their surfaces were clean. Their housings were
unpitted, undamaged, unmarked by the century of decay that had consumed
everything above them.

And they were running.

Della could hear it -- a low, steady hum, felt more than heard, the
sound of machinery in operation. Power flowing through circuits.
Motors turning. Something being done.

She stared into the hole for a long time. The machines below her were
arranged in rows, connected by conveyor belts that moved with a slow,
continuous motion. Something was being carried on the belts -- small
objects, uniform in size and shape, that Della could not identify from
this height. At the far end of the visible space, a mechanical arm
picked objects from the belt and placed them in a container that looked
like a large metal bin.

The factory was producing. Whatever it had been built to make, it was
still making it. A hundred years after the world ended, a hundred years
after the city died and the people left and the buildings fell, this
factory -- buried, hidden, sealed beneath the concrete floor -- was
still doing its job.

Della looked at the machines, and the machines hummed, and the conveyor
belts moved, and the mechanical arm picked and placed, picked and
placed, with the patient, tireless precision of a thing that had been
told to do something and had never been told to stop.

                               * * *

She went down.

There was no ladder, but the rubble from the collapsed floor had formed
a rough slope, and Della climbed down it carefully, bracing herself
against the broken concrete with her pry bar. The air below was
different -- warmer, drier, with a faint chemical smell that she could
not identify. Machine oil, maybe. Ozone. Something industrial.

The floor of the underground space was smooth concrete, uncracked,
as clean as the day it had been poured. The machines rose around her
in rows, each one about the size of a large desk, their housings a
dull gray metal that showed no corrosion. They were connected by a
network of cables and pipes, all intact, all functioning. The conveyor
belts ran between them at waist height, carrying the small objects from
one machine to the next in a sequence that Della recognized as an
assembly process.

She picked up one of the objects from the belt. It was small -- about
the size of her thumb -- and made of a material she did not recognize:
smooth, dense, faintly warm, with a color that was not quite gray and
not quite silver. It was shaped like a cylinder with a rounded top and
a flat bottom, and its surface was inscribed with markings -- fine,
precise lines that formed a pattern too regular to be decorative and too
complex to be functional in any way she could understand.

She turned it over in her hands. It weighed almost nothing. It felt
solid. It did not look like anything she had ever seen, and it did not
look like anything she could use.

She walked along the assembly line, following the conveyor belt. The
machines performed their operations in sequence: the first machine
extruded the raw material into cylinders. The second machine shaped
the top. The third inscribed the markings. The fourth applied the
surface finish. The fifth tested each cylinder -- she could see a
brief flash of light as each one passed through the testing station --
and rejected the occasional unit, dropping it into a waste chute. The
sixth and final machine deposited the finished cylinders into the
metal bins at the end of the line.

The bins were full. Not just the ones at the end of the active line --
there were dozens of bins stacked against the far wall, each one packed
with cylinders. Hundreds of thousands of them, maybe millions. A
century of production, stacked in metal containers in an underground
factory, waiting for someone to come and collect them.

No one had come.

                               * * *

Della explored the factory for three hours. It was larger than she had
first estimated -- the underground space extended well beyond the
footprint of the building above it, a cavern of machined concrete and
silent, efficient equipment. There were six assembly lines, all
running. There were storage areas, maintenance bays, and a power plant
in a sealed chamber at the far end that produced a deeper, more
resonant hum than the manufacturing equipment. She could not identify
the power source. It was not a generator she recognized. It was not
solar, not wind, not combustion. It was something else, something
beyond her understanding, and it had been running for a hundred years.

She found an office. A small room, walled off from the manufacturing
floor, with a desk and a chair and a filing cabinet. The filing
cabinet was locked. She pried it open with her bar.

Inside were papers. Real paper, yellowed but intact, preserved by the
dry, controlled atmosphere of the underground space. Della could read
-- her mother had taught her, from a water-damaged copy of a
children's primer that was the settlement's most prized possession --
but the words on these papers were difficult. Technical language.
Engineering specifications. Production schedules. She understood
perhaps one word in three.

But she understood enough.

The factory had been built before the collapse. Built underground,
deliberately, with its own power supply and its own raw material
reserves, designed to operate without human intervention for an
indefinite period. It was, the documents explained, an "autonomous
manufacturing facility" -- a factory that ran itself, maintained
itself, and produced its product without the need for workers, managers,
or customers.

The product was described in the documents by a designation number
that meant nothing to Della. Its function was described in language
that she could not fully parse, but the key phrases repeated:
"atmospheric remediation," "long-term environmental stabilization,"
"post-event deployment protocol."

She set the papers down and went back to the manufacturing floor. She
picked up another cylinder and looked at it. Atmospheric remediation.
The factory was making something designed to fix the atmosphere. To
clean it, or stabilize it, or repair whatever damage had caused the
collapse in the first place.

She looked at the bins against the wall. Millions of cylinders.
Millions of tiny atmospheric remediation devices, manufactured
patiently and perfectly by machines that had been running for a
hundred years, waiting for someone to come and deploy them.

And no one had come. Because the people who had built the factory were
dead, or gone, or had forgotten it existed. And the people who lived
now -- Della and her settlement, the few hundred souls who scratched a
living from the ruins -- did not know it was here. Did not know that
beneath their feet, beneath the rust and the rubble and the century
of decay, a machine was quietly, patiently, endlessly solving the
problem that had ended their world.

                               * * *

She sat on the factory floor, her back against one of the machines,
and thought.

The cylinders could fix the atmosphere. Maybe. The documents said they
could. But the documents were a hundred years old, written by people
who had anticipated a collapse and built a solution and buried it
underground and then -- what? Died before they could use it? Forgotten
where they put it? Lost the knowledge, the way knowledge was lost in
the years after everything fell apart, when the libraries burned and
the computers stopped and the people who understood things were not
replaced by other people who understood things?

She did not know. The documents did not say. They were engineering
specifications, not history. They told you what the machine did, not
why no one had used it.

She looked at the cylinder in her hand. It was small, precise,
perfectly made. A hundred years of manufacturing, and every unit was
identical. The machines did not get bored, did not make mistakes, did
not cut corners because the shift was long and the work was tedious.
They made the thing they were designed to make, over and over and over,
with a fidelity that no human process could match.

And no human had asked them to. The factory was not serving a purpose.
Not anymore. The purpose had died with the people who designed it. What
remained was the process -- the pure, purposeless, perfect process of
making a thing that no one would collect, for a reason that no one
remembered, in a factory that no one knew existed.

Della understood this, and she understood that it was the saddest thing
she had ever seen. Not the ruins above -- the ruins were sad, but they
were comprehensible. Things fell apart. That was what things did. But
this -- this patient, pointless, endless act of creation, this machine
that had not stopped because no one had told it to stop, that continued
to solve a problem because no one had told it the problem was no longer
being addressed -- this was something else. This was tragedy on a scale
that had nothing to do with human suffering and everything to do with
human failure.

They had built the solution. They had built it underground, where it
would be safe. They had designed it to run forever. And then they had
died, and the solution had kept running, and the problem had kept
existing, and the distance between the two -- between the cure and the
disease, between the factory and the sky -- was four meters of concrete
and a hundred years of silence.

                               * * *

She went home.

The settlement was three miles west, a cluster of shelters built from
salvaged materials in the ruins of what had once been a residential
neighborhood. Forty-seven people. Families, mostly. Farmers who grew
stunted crops in soil that was slowly recovering. Scavengers like Della
who walked the ruins and brought back anything useful. A mechanic named
Harlan who could fix almost anything and who served as the settlement's
closest approximation to an engineer. A teacher named Rose who ran the
school for the eleven children.

Della found Harlan in his workshop -- a lean-to attached to the
settlement's largest shelter, filled with tools and parts and the
organized chaos of a man who believed that everything could be fixed if
you understood how it worked.

She set one of the cylinders on his workbench.

"What is that?" Harlan asked.

"I don't know. I found a factory."

Harlan picked up the cylinder and turned it in his fingers. He held it
up to the light. He tapped it against the bench. He brought it close
to his ear and listened, as if the object might whisper its purpose.

"Where?"

"Eastern industrial district. Underground. Beneath a warehouse floor.
The factory is intact, Harlan. It's running. The machines are on. The
power is on. It's been making these things for a hundred years."

Harlan set the cylinder down and looked at her. "Running. For a
hundred years."

"I found documents. Engineering papers. The cylinders are for
atmospheric remediation. They're designed to clean the air. To fix
whatever happened."

Harlan was quiet for a long time. He picked up the cylinder again and
looked at it, and Della could see the mechanic's mind working behind
his eyes -- the same mind that could look at a broken pump and
understand, without being told, where the failure was and how to
repair it.

"If these do what you say they do," he said slowly, "then someone
built a machine to fix the world. And the machine has been running
this whole time. Making the fix. Waiting for someone to use it."

"Yes."

"And no one ever came."

"No."

Harlan put the cylinder down. He looked at his workbench, at the
tools and parts and salvaged equipment, at the entire apparatus of
his life's work, which was the work of keeping a small community alive
in the ruins of a civilization that had known how to build factories
that ran themselves.

"Well," he said. "Someone's here now."

                               * * *

It took them six months.

Six months of work, of hauling bins of cylinders from the underground
factory to the surface, of reading the deployment documents that Della
had found in the filing cabinet, of figuring out -- through trial and
error and Harlan's mechanical intuition and Rose's ability to parse
the technical language -- how the cylinders were meant to be used.

The deployment was simple, once they understood it. You opened the
cylinder -- there was a twist mechanism at the base that Harlan
discovered by accident when he dropped one and it cracked -- and you
set it on the ground, and the contents dispersed into the atmosphere.
Each cylinder contained a payload of microscopic particles -- catalytic
agents, the documents called them -- that reacted with the pollutants
in the upper atmosphere and broke them down into harmless compounds.
One cylinder treated approximately one square kilometer of atmosphere.
The factory had produced enough cylinders to treat a region the size
of a small state.

They deployed them. Methodically, carefully, walking the ruins in
teams, placing the opened cylinders at regular intervals according to
the grid pattern specified in the documents. The work was slow and
unglamorous -- carrying bins, twisting open cylinders, walking, placing,
walking, placing -- and it was the most important work any of them had
ever done.

The sky began to change.

It was slow. Della did not notice it at first -- you did not notice
slow things when your days were full of urgent things. But after three
months of deployment, someone mentioned that the sunsets were different.
Cleaner. The perpetual haze that had hung over the ruins for as long as
anyone could remember -- a yellowish murk that turned the sun into a
pale disk and made the stars invisible -- was thinning. The light was
sharper. The air tasted different.

The crops grew better. Not dramatically, not overnight, but Della's
mother -- who had kept a garden before the settlement and knew what
healthy soil smelled like -- said the ground was changing. The rain,
when it came, was cleaner. The water in the cisterns was clearer.

The world was healing. Slowly, invisibly, one square kilometer at a
time, the atmosphere was repairing itself, catalyzed by millions of
tiny cylinders that had been manufactured by machines that had been
running in the dark for a hundred years, waiting for someone to come.

                               * * *

Della went back to the factory one last time.

The machines were still running. The conveyor belts were still moving.
The mechanical arms were still picking and placing. The bins at the end
of the line were filling again -- new cylinders, added to the
stockpile, ready for deployment.

She stood on the factory floor and listened to the hum. It was a
patient sound. Not urgent, not demanding, not anxious. Patient. The
sound of a machine doing what it was designed to do, without complaint,
without fatigue, without the need for recognition or gratitude. It had
been built to fix the world. It was fixing the world. That was enough.

Della put her hand on the nearest machine. The metal was warm. The
vibration traveled through her palm and up her arm, and she felt,
for a moment, connected to the people who had built this -- the
engineers, the designers, the planners who had looked at a world
that was falling apart and had said: We can't stop the fall. But we
can build something that will help them get back up.

They had not lived to see it work. They had built it on faith -- faith
not in God, not in government, not in the inherent goodness of
humanity, but in the simpler and more durable faith that someone,
someday, would find what they had left behind and understand what to
do with it.

Della stood in the factory, her hand on the warm machine, and the
machines hummed, and the conveyor belts moved, and outside, above the
rust and the rubble and the century of silence, the sky was clearing.

She walked home in the late afternoon light, and the light was golden,
and for the first time in her life, the light was golden not because of
the haze but because that was the color the light was supposed to be.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

HAROLD "HAL" MERCER is a civil engineer and science fiction writer from
Akron, Ohio, whose stories about large-scale engineering projects have
made him one of our most distinctive and technically accomplished
contributors. His previous stories for these pages include "Load-
Bearing" (Issue #7), "The Cable" (Issue #11), and "Foundation Stress"
(Issue #13). By day, he designs highway interchanges for the Ohio
Department of Transportation; by night, he designs orbital habitats,
space elevators, and -- as of this issue -- Dyson swarms. "The Dyson
Initiative" is his most ambitious project to date, and we are pleased
to present the first of what will be a multi-part serial. Mr. Mercer
reports that the story is accompanied, in his files, by fourteen pages
of engineering diagrams that we have, once again, declined to publish.

FRANKLIN HOYT is a journalist and writer based in Washington, D.C.,
whose debut story "The Committee" (Issue #14) provoked more reader mail
than any story we have published to date. A graduate of Howard
University and a veteran of the United States Army, Mr. Hoyt covers
Congress for several Washington newspapers and writes science fiction
because, as he explains, "the editorial page won't let me say what I
actually think." "Obedience Index" is his second appearance in these
pages and, we suspect, not his last. The opinions expressed in his
fiction are his own, and we are proud to publish them.

REX DRUMMOND needs no introduction to our regular readers. A former
merchant marine officer, bomber pilot, and self-described "professional
troublemaker," he has been a fixture in these pages since Issue #1. His
previous stories include "Doublecross on Deimos," "Blood Orbit," and
the popular Jake Corvin series. "Treasure of the Sunken Fleet"
represents something of a departure for Mr. Drummond -- it is, he
assures us, "the same old noise, just underwater." He lives in San
Diego and is at work on a novel that he describes as "Moby Dick with
spaceships," which we await with considerable anticipation and some
trepidation.

OSCAR LENNOX is a professor of history at Boston University and the
author of some of the most intellectually ambitious fiction we have
published. His previous stories include "The Lateral View" (Issue #8),
"Probability Zero" (Issue #10), and "The Counterfactual Club" (Issue
#12). A specialist in counterfactual history and the many-worlds
interpretation of quantum mechanics, Dr. Lennox brings a historian's
rigor and a philosopher's imagination to his fiction. He reports that
"Forking Paths" -- whose title pays homage to a certain
Argentine writer -- was inspired by a late-night conversation with a
colleague about the irreversibility of regret. He lives in Brookline,
Massachusetts, with his wife Patricia and approximately four thousand
books.

THEODORE CAIN is our most prolific contributor, and "Sandcastle Empires"
is his fifteenth story for these pages -- a record that we suspect will
stand for some time, as no other writer in our stable shows any sign of
matching his output or his consistency. A former autoworker and current
technical writer in Detroit, Mr. Cain writes with the quiet precision
of a craftsman who understands that a well-made story, like a well-made
engine, depends on tolerances too fine for the casual observer to
notice. "Sandcastle Empires" is, we believe, among his finest work --
a story of unexpected tenderness about impermanent things.

AGNES WHITFIELD is a former schoolteacher from Salina, Kansas, whose
spare, luminous fiction has been a highlight of this magazine since her
debut, "After the Sirens" (Issue #13). Her stories -- which deal with
survival, rebuilding, and the stubborn persistence of human community
in the aftermath of catastrophe -- carry the authority of a writer who
grew up watching the sky for weather and who understands, in her bones,
that the most important things in life are the ones you cannot control.
"Beneath the Rust" is her third appearance in these pages. She writes
at her kitchen table in Kansas and sends her manuscripts by mail, neatly
typed on a Royal portable typewriter.

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I must write to express my admiration for Franklin Hoyt's "The
Committee" in your February issue. It is the bravest story I have read
in any science fiction magazine this year -- perhaps in any magazine,
period. That a loyalty board on a space station could so precisely
mirror the proceedings of a certain congressional committee currently
making headlines is either a remarkable coincidence or a deliberate act
of political commentary. I suspect the latter, and I applaud it.
Science fiction has always been a literature of warning, and Mr. Hoyt's
warning is as timely as tomorrow's newspaper.

Dear Editor,

Rex Drummond's "Doublecross on Deimos" in your January issue was
terrific fun, as Drummond's stories always are, but I must take issue
with his description of the gravity wells in the asteroid belt. At the
distances he specifies, the gravitational influence of the asteroids
on the Diamondback's trajectory would be negligible, not "a constant
drag on the engines." I understand that narrative convenience sometimes
trumps orbital mechanics, but some of us are trying to maintain
standards.

                                 Annapolis, Maryland

Dear Tales,

Agnes Whitfield's "After the Sirens" brought me to tears. I grew up
on a farm in Nebraska, and the way she writes about the land -- the
soil, the weather, the patience required to grow anything worth
growing -- is so precise and so true that I forgot I was reading
science fiction. She writes about the end of the world the way my
grandmother talked about the Depression: not with dramatics, but with
the plain, steady voice of someone who has survived something terrible
and intends to keep surviving. More from Miss Whitfield, please. As
much as you can get.

                                 Lincoln, Nebraska

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have been reading science fiction magazines since 1938, and I believe
"Tales from the Future and Beyond" is the finest new magazine to appear
since Galaxy launched in 1950. Your roster of writers is superb, your
editorial standards are high, and your willingness to publish stories
that challenge the reader rather than merely entertain him is
refreshing. I particularly appreciate the range of your contributors --
Koslov's intellectual rigor, Drummond's raw energy, Thornton's
ecological vision, and now Hoyt's political courage. Keep it up.

                              — Samuel Greenbaum
                                 Brooklyn, New York

We are grateful for these letters and for the many others we have
received. Keep writing to us at: Letters, Tales from the Future and
Beyond, Meridian Publishing Company, 114 East 32nd Street, New York
16, N.Y. We read every letter and publish as many as space allows.
                                                              — M.S.

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement has given us what may be the purest example of "hard"
science fiction ever written, and it is a delight. The planet Mesklin --
a massive, rapidly spinning oblate spheroid with a surface gravity
that varies from three times Earth's at the equator to nearly seven
hundred times Earth's at the poles -- is the true protagonist of this
novel. The story follows Barlennan, a caterpillar-like alien merchant
captain, as he traverses the planet's extraordinary geography to
recover a human probe stranded at the pole. The physics is rigorous,
the worldbuilding is meticulous, and the reader emerges with a genuine
understanding of how gravity, atmosphere, and rotation shape a world.
If the human characters are somewhat wooden and the prose functional
rather than beautiful, these are small prices to pay for a novel that
makes you feel the weight of seven hundred gravities in your bones.
Highly recommended for anyone who believes that science fiction should
take its first word seriously.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $3.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

If Hal Clement represents the rigorously scientific end of the
spectrum, Theodore Sturgeon represents the other end -- the end where
science fiction becomes a vehicle for the deepest explorations of human
loneliness, connection, and the desperate need to belong. "More Than
Human" is the story of a gestalt -- a group of extraordinary
individuals who, separately, are broken and incomplete, but who
together form a single, transcendent entity greater than the sum of
its parts. The writing is gorgeous, lyrical, emotionally devastating.
Sturgeon has always been the most human of science fiction writers, and
this is his most human book. It will, I predict, be remembered long
after many of this year's more technically accomplished novels have
been forgotten. Essential reading.

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Dr. Asimov has accomplished something that should not, by any
reasonable standard, work: he has written a detective novel set in a
science fiction future, and both the detective story and the science
fiction are excellent. Elijah Baley, a plainclothes detective in a
vast, enclosed, agoraphobic future New York, must solve a murder with
the help of R. Daneel Olivaw, a humaniform robot whose presence he
resents and whose competence he cannot deny. The mystery is clever,
the worldbuilding is characteristically thorough (Asimov's enclosed
cities are as convincing as Clement's high-gravity planets), and the
relationship between Baley and Daneel provides an emotional core that
Asimov's work does not always achieve. A thoroughly satisfying novel
and a promising start to what one hopes will be a series.

          Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #16 — April 1954

We are pleased to announce the contents of our sixteenth issue, which
will be on newsstands in late March:

"THE DYSON INITIATIVE, PART II" by Harold "Hal" Mercer — The political
storm around the Dyson swarm intensifies as Mercury and Mars form an
alliance to demand an independent environmental review. Chief Architect
Yuki Tanaka faces her greatest challenge yet: building consensus across
a solar system that cannot agree on the future.

"LONG WATCH" by Gunnar Eriksson — A lone watchkeeper on a
generation ship maintains his vigil during the decades-long crossing
between stars. A story of solitude, duty, and the meaning of a single
human life against the backdrop of cosmic time. A new voice in our
pages, and a remarkable one.

"THE INHERITANCE" by Theodore Cain — A family on a colony world
discovers that their homestead sits atop an alien artifact that is
far more valuable than the land itself. A story about what we owe the
past and what the past owes us.

"THE SECOND COMMITTEE" by Franklin Hoyt — A sequel to his explosive
debut. The loyalty board's methods have evolved, and the stakes have
risen. Not for the faint of heart.

Plus: a new story by Margaret Thornton, book reviews, reader letters,
and more.
