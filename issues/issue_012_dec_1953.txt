TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

One year ago this month, I sat down at this desk and wrote a letter to an
audience that did not yet exist. I spoke of voyages and visions, of a new
magazine that would seek the finest imaginative fiction being written today,
and I confessed — with rather more candor than my publisher thought wise —
that I was not entirely certain anyone would listen.

You listened.

Twelve issues. Seventy-two stories. Hundreds of letters from readers across
the country and, increasingly, from around the world. One gentleman in
Melbourne, Australia, writes us with meticulous regularity, correcting our
astronomy. A schoolteacher in Wichita uses our stories in her classroom. A
machinist in Pittsburgh tells us he reads each issue three times. A young
woman in Boston informs us, with some severity, that we do not publish
enough stories by women, and she is right, and we are working to remedy
this. To all of you: thank you. A magazine is a conversation, I wrote in
our first editorial, and you have held up your end with intelligence,
passion, and generosity.

For this anniversary issue, I wanted something special. It is December,
after all — the season of gift-giving and candlelight, of looking back and
looking forward. I asked our contributors to write stories about the
holidays, about winter, about light in dark places and warmth against the
cold. What they have given me exceeds anything I could have hoped for.

Father Aquino opens our pages with a Christmas story that is also a story
about faith, navigation, and the oldest form of guidance there is.
Theodore Cain delivers a holiday romp across twelve star systems that will
leave you grinning. Arthur Wainwright gives us a robot who tells a story
within a story — and breaks your heart doing it. Dr. Koslov takes us to a
dying binary system where winter is not a season but a sentence. Douglas
Pemberton offers a comic tragedy of interstellar gift-giving that O. Henry
himself might envy. Agnes Whitfield finds hope in the ruins of a shattered
world. And Phyllis Crenshaw closes our issue with a time-travel tale that
captures the fragile, irreplaceable magic of a single Christmas Eve.

Seven stories. Seven gifts. One year of gratitude.

I will not be coy about the future: we are here to stay. Meridian has
renewed our contract for a second year, our circulation is climbing, and I
have on my desk manuscripts that will astonish you. The new year brings new
voices, new worlds, and new wonders. We are only beginning.

But tonight, in the season of peace and reflection, I want simply to say:
thank you for reading. Thank you for writing to us. Thank you for arguing
with us, correcting us, encouraging us, and demanding more. You have made
this first year an extraordinary one.

Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond

                     BETHLEHEM RUN

                     by Father Thomas Aquino

================================================================================

                              I.

The distress signal from New Galilee Colony reached the relief station at
Cygnus Waypoint on the fourteenth of December, and by the time Captain
Maria Santos had finished reading the transmission, she knew two things
with the certainty of a woman who has spent fourteen years in deep space:
that many people were going to die, and that someone had to try to prevent
it.

The transmission was terse, as emergency signals tend to be. The colony's
medical officer, a Dr. Ephraim Yost, had composed it with the economy of
a man whose time was already running out. Hemorrhagic fever, variant
unknown. Two hundred nineteen cases confirmed. Thirty-seven dead. Colony
stores of broad-spectrum antivirals exhausted. Population: sixteen hundred
souls. Estimated time to total depletion of palliative care: eleven days.

Santos set the message down on the steel desk of her quarters aboard the
_Santa Clara_ and pressed her fingers against her temples. The _Santa
Clara_ was a relief vessel — a converted military transport, broad-bellied
and ungraceful, loaded to the hull seams with medical supplies, emergency
rations, and prefabricated shelter modules. She had been bound for the
mining settlements in the Altair sector, a routine delivery that would have
consumed the better part of January. New Galilee was not on her manifest.
It was not on her route. It was, in fact, nearly eight days' travel in the
opposite direction, tucked into a sparse cluster of stars on the far edge
of the Cygnus Arm that the old pilots called the Shepherds' Field.

Eight days out, eight days back. Sixteen days of deviation from her
assigned course. The mining settlements would wait — they were not in
crisis — but the bureaucratic consequences of an unauthorized rerouting
would be considerable. Relief Command did not appreciate improvisation.

Santos called up the star chart on the navigation console beside her bunk
and studied the route to New Galilee. The path was not complicated. Five
days at standard thrust to the transit corridor, then three days through
the corridor itself, which ran along the inner edge of the Cygnus Arm like
a river through a valley. She had traveled worse routes in worse ships.

But eight days. Eleven days until the colony's medical supplies were gone.
It was, as the old expression had it, cutting it fine.

She tapped the intercom. "Bridge, this is Santos. All senior officers to
the wardroom in fifteen minutes."

The wardroom of the _Santa Clara_ was a narrow compartment with a bolted
table and eight chairs that did not match. Santos had served on the ship
for three years, and in that time she had learned that the wardroom's
fluorescent lights hummed at a frequency precisely calibrated to produce
headaches in anyone who remained under them for more than forty-five
minutes. She had submitted four requisitions for replacement fixtures.
None had been approved.

Her senior officers assembled with the unhurried competence of people who
have been awakened by urgency so many times that it no longer accelerates
them. First Officer Ade Okonkwo, a tall Nigerian with hands like dock
cranes and a voice so quiet you had to lean forward to hear it. Chief
Navigator Lucas Telford, slight and nervous, already pulling up star
charts on his portable console before he sat down. Chief Medical Officer
Dr. Aniyah Rhodes, who carried herself with the contained intensity of a
woman who had seen plagues before and knew what they could do. Chief
Engineer Rafael Vega, who entered last, wiping grease from his fingers
with a rag he then tucked into his belt with the meticulousness of a
priest folding a stole.

Santos briefed them in six minutes. She had learned early in her career
that efficiency in briefings was a form of respect — both for her
officers' intelligence and for the urgency of the situation.

When she finished, silence held the room. Rhodes was the first to speak.

"Hemorrhagic fever, variant unknown. That's Dr. Yost's language. He's
being cautious. It could be anything from a modified influenza to
something entirely novel."

"Thirty-seven dead in — how long?" Okonkwo asked.

"The signal doesn't specify onset date," Santos said. "But the progression
rate suggests ten to fourteen days since first case presentation."

Rhodes nodded slowly. "That's fast. Faster than most hemorrhagic variants
we have on file. Captain, if we arrive in eight days and the fever has been
burning through that colony for three weeks by then — "

"I know," Santos said.

"We have the antivirals in cargo bay two," Rhodes continued. "Broad
spectrum, military grade, enough for three thousand doses. But if this is a
novel variant, broad spectrum may not be sufficient. We'd be buying time,
not curing."

"Time is what they need," Santos said. "Time for a proper medical response
team to arrive from the central worlds. Our job would be to keep people
alive until that team gets there."

"The central worlds are twenty-six days from New Galilee at best speed,"
Telford said, without looking up from his charts. He had a habit of
providing unwelcome facts in a flat, informational tone, as though
reporting weather conditions. "Assuming Relief Command authorizes a medical
response team immediately upon receiving our relay of the distress signal."

"Which they will," Santos said.

"Which they may," Okonkwo corrected gently. "New Galilee is a small
colony, Captain. Sixteen hundred people, out beyond the main shipping
lanes. The committee may decide to wait for more information before
committing a response team."

Santos looked at him. Okonkwo held her gaze with the steady patience of a
man who has learned that truth does not improve for being avoided.

"Then we'll make certain our relay is compelling," Santos said. "Dr.
Rhodes, I want you to compose a medical supplement to the distress signal.
Everything you can extrapolate from Dr. Yost's data. Make the committee
understand what they're looking at."

"Understood."

"Mr. Telford, plot us a course for New Galilee. Best speed, most efficient
route."

Telford's fingers moved across his console. Then stopped. He frowned.

"Problem?" Santos asked.

"Not exactly, Captain. The most efficient route takes us through the
Shepherds' Field transit corridor, as you'd expect. Standard navigation
through the corridor is automated — the ship's computer handles the course
corrections required by the gravitational irregularities in that region.
It's routine."

"Then what's the frown for?"

Telford looked up. "The corridor is dense. Gravitationally complex. Lots
of brown dwarfs, rogue planets, stellar remnants. The computer handles it
because the calculations are beyond practical human capacity — thousands of
micro-corrections per hour, accounting for gravitational perturbations from
objects we can barely see. If the computer is functioning normally, there's
no problem at all."

"And if it isn't?" Santos asked, though she knew the answer.

"If the navigational computer fails in the Shepherds' Field corridor, we
would be unable to navigate manually. We would have to drop to sub-light,
exit the corridor, and recalculate from a position of known coordinates.
That would add — " he glanced at his charts, "four to six days to our
transit time."

"Which would put us at New Galilee well past the eleven-day window," Rhodes
said.

"The computer is functioning normally," Vega said from the end of the
table. "I ran diagnostics this morning. Everything is within parameters."

"Then we proceed," Santos said. "Plot the course, Mr. Telford. Mr. Vega,
I want continuous diagnostics on the nav computer for the duration of the
transit. Anything outside normal parameters, I want to know immediately."

"Understood," Vega said.

Santos stood. "One more thing. I am aware that this is an unauthorized
deviation from our assigned route. I am aware that Relief Command has
procedures for exactly this kind of situation, and that those procedures
involve filing a request and waiting for authorization. I am also aware
that the time required for that authorization process would likely exceed
the survival window of sixteen hundred people. I am therefore making the
decision to proceed without authorization, and I am noting in the ship's
log that this decision is mine alone. If there are consequences, they are
mine."

No one spoke. No one needed to.

"We'll arrive at New Galilee on or about December twenty-fifth," Santos
said. "Christmas Day. I should think that qualifies as an appropriate
occasion for delivering gifts."

The ghost of a smile crossed Okonkwo's face. "I believe it does, Captain."

                              II.

The _Santa Clara_ entered the Shepherds' Field transit corridor at 0600
hours on December eighteenth. The corridor was not, of course, a physical
structure — it was a region of space where the gravitational topology
permitted efficient faster-than-light transit, a natural channel carved
by the competing gravitational influences of dense stellar objects.
Navigating it was like sailing a river with invisible banks: safe enough if
you stayed in the channel, catastrophic if you drifted.

Santos stood on the bridge as the ship entered the corridor and watched the
star field shift and blur on the main display. At faster-than-light speeds,
the visual distortion was considerable — stars stretched into filaments of
light, colors shifted toward the blue, and the familiar constellations
became unrecognizable abstractions. She had made hundreds of transits and
still found the view unsettling. It was too much like looking at the face
of God: beautiful and incomprehensible and faintly terrifying.

The thought surprised her. She was not, by habit, a woman who thought in
theological terms. She had been raised Catholic — her mother had seen to
that, lighting candles every Sunday in the small church in Recife where
Maria had been baptized — but the faith had not survived her first decade
in space. Not because she had encountered anything that disproved it, but
because the universe she had come to know was so much larger and stranger
than anything the catechism had prepared her for. She had not rejected
God; she had simply lost the coordinates.

But here, in the transit corridor, with the stars warped into streamers
of light and the ship trembling faintly against the fabric of distorted
space-time, the old language came back. Shepherds' Field. The Star of
Bethlehem. Wise men navigating by a light they did not fully understand,
trusting that it would lead them where they needed to go.

She dismissed the thought and turned to the navigation console. Telford
was monitoring the automated course corrections, his thin fingers resting
on the edge of the console like a pianist waiting for his cue. The numbers
scrolled steadily: gravitational vectors, course adjustments, velocity
corrections, all handled by the navigational computer with the silent
efficiency of a well-rehearsed machine.

"Transit is nominal, Captain," Telford reported. "Computer is handling the
corrections within expected parameters. Estimated corridor transit time:
seventy-one hours."

"Very well. Maintain monitoring."

She spent the next three hours reviewing the colony data that Dr. Rhodes
had assembled. New Galilee was one of the small faith-based colonies that
had sprung up in the outer sectors during the Great Expansion — a
community of roughly sixteen hundred people, predominantly Catholic, who
had settled on a temperate world in the Cygnus Arm with the intention of
building what their charter described as "a community of faith, labor, and
learning." They had a church, a school, a hospital, a farm cooperative,
and a small observatory that doubled as a communications relay. Their
colony ship, the _San Jose_, served as an orbital platform and emergency
shelter.

Santos studied the faces in the colony registry. Farmers, teachers,
doctors, mechanics, priests. Children. Eight hundred and twelve of the
colonists were under the age of thirty. Nearly three hundred were under
twelve.

She set the registry down and walked to the observation port at the rear
of the bridge. The stars were still distorted — long, luminous threads
of light stretching across the blackness. She watched them and tried to
imagine what it was like in New Galilee right now. The sick and the dying
lying in rows in the colony hospital. The doctors working with dwindling
supplies. The parents watching their children for the first signs of
fever.

The intercom chimed.

"Captain, this is Vega." The chief engineer's voice carried an edge she
had not heard before. "I need you in engineering. We have a situation."

                              III.

The situation, as Vega described it, was not yet a crisis. It was the
precursor to a crisis — the faint tremor before the earthquake, the hairline
crack in the load-bearing wall. The navigational computer's core processor
was showing intermittent fluctuations in its error-correction routines.

"Show me," Santos said.

Vega pulled up the diagnostic display on the engineering console. The
numbers were densely packed and, to Santos, largely incomprehensible
in their specifics. But she understood the shape of the problem. The
computer's error-correction routines were designed to catch and compensate
for processing errors — tiny glitches in the billions of calculations per
second that the system performed. Under normal conditions, the error rate
was vanishingly small. What the display showed was an error rate that was
still small, but growing.

"How fast?" Santos asked.

"The rate has approximately doubled in the last six hours," Vega said. He
spoke carefully, as a man does when he is trying to be precise about
something that frightens him. "If the progression continues at this rate,
the error-correction routines will be overwhelmed within — " he paused,
calculating, "thirty to forty hours."

"And when the error-correction fails?"

"The navigational calculations become unreliable. The course corrections
that keep us in the transit corridor become erratic. At that point, the
computer cannot safely navigate the Shepherds' Field."

Santos felt the weight of the arithmetic settle onto her shoulders. Thirty
to forty hours. The corridor transit was seventy-one hours. They would not
make it through.

"What's causing it?" she asked.

"I don't know yet. It could be a hardware degradation — the core processor
is three years past its recommended replacement interval. It could be a
software fault. It could be cosmic ray damage — the corridor is dense with
radiation sources. I need time to diagnose."

"How much time?"

Vega hesitated. "If it's hardware, I can potentially bypass the degraded
circuits and reroute through the backup processor. That would take eight
to twelve hours. If it's software, I can attempt a cold restart of the
navigation system, which would take the computer offline for approximately
ninety minutes. During that ninety minutes, we would have no automated
navigation."

"In the middle of the Shepherds' Field corridor."

"Yes."

"That's not acceptable," Santos said.

"No," Vega agreed.

Santos stood very still for a moment. The engineering compartment hummed
around her — the deep, constant vibration of the ship's drives, the higher
whine of the computer systems, the soft clicking of diagnostic equipment.
These were the sounds of her world. She had lived inside them for fourteen
years.

"Begin your diagnostics," she said. "Find the cause. Report to me every
two hours. And Mr. Vega — I want options. Every option you can think of,
no matter how unlikely."

"Understood, Captain."

She returned to the bridge and found Telford still at his console,
watching the numbers scroll. She told him what Vega had found. Telford
listened without expression, then asked the question she had been hoping
he would not ask.

"Captain, if the computer fails completely during transit, what are your
orders?"

"We drop to sub-light, exit the corridor, and navigate to New Galilee by
conventional means."

"That adds four to six days to our transit time."

"I'm aware of that, Mr. Telford."

"Which puts our arrival at New Galilee between December twenty-ninth and
thirty-first. Eighteen to twenty days after the onset of the epidemic. If
Dr. Rhodes's projections are correct, that's — "

"I know what it is, Mr. Telford."

Telford fell silent. Then, quietly: "There is another possibility,
Captain."

Santos looked at him.

"If the computer fails," Telford said, "we don't necessarily have to exit
the corridor. The corridor is navigable. It's just not navigable by
computer in its degraded state. But navigation is — " he paused, choosing
his words, "navigation is what human beings did for thousands of years
before computers existed."

"You're suggesting we navigate the Shepherds' Field corridor manually."

"I'm suggesting we could try. The corridor is defined by gravitational
topology. The gravitational influences that shape it originate from visible
objects — brown dwarfs, stellar remnants, dense nebulae. If I can identify
and track those objects visually and on passive sensors, I can — in theory
— plot course corrections manually."

"In theory."

"In theory, Captain. I won't pretend the mathematics would be simple. The
number of simultaneous gravitational influences in the Shepherds' Field is
— considerable. The computer handles thousands of corrections per hour. A
human navigator could handle — " he hesitated again, "perhaps twelve to
fifteen per hour, with acceptable accuracy."

"Which means we'd need to reduce speed."

"Dramatically. We'd need to slow to a fraction of our current velocity to
give me time to calculate and implement corrections. That would extend our
corridor transit from seventy-one hours to — " he worked the numbers on
his console, "approximately one hundred and twenty hours."

"Five days."

"Five days in the corridor, plus the remaining transit time to New Galilee.
Total arrival: December twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh."

Santos considered. One or two days past Christmas. One or two days past
the eleven-day window. It was still late. But it was better than the
alternative — four to six days late, and sixteen hundred people running
out of time.

"It would be like the old navigators," Santos said, half to herself. "The
Polynesian wayfinders. The desert caravan pilots. Following the stars."

Telford permitted himself a small, scholarly smile. "In a manner of
speaking, yes. Although the old navigators generally had the advantage of
knowing where the gravitational hazards were. We would be somewhat more
in the dark."

"Somewhat."

"Considerably, Captain."

Santos nodded. "Hold that option, Mr. Telford. I want you to begin
preparing for the possibility. Identify every gravitational source in the
corridor that you can detect on passive sensors. Map them. Calculate their
individual influences. Build me a manual navigation framework."

Telford's eyes widened slightly. Then he nodded once, briskly, and turned
to his console.

                              IV.

Vega's diagnostics took fourteen hours and delivered the worst of the
possible answers: the core processor was failing. Not software, not cosmic
rays, but the physical deterioration of the processor's crystalline
substrate — a known failure mode in processors that had been operated
continuously beyond their rated lifespan. The failure was progressive and
irreversible. The computer would continue to function, with increasing
unreliability, for another twenty to thirty hours. After that, it would
be useless for the complex calculations required to navigate the corridor.

The backup processor could handle basic ship functions — life support,
communications, routine operations — but it lacked the processing capacity
for corridor navigation. Vega had spent six hours attempting to jury-rig a
configuration that would distribute the navigational load across the backup
processor and several smaller systems. It was not enough. The mathematics
of the Shepherds' Field were beyond any combination of secondary systems
he could assemble.

"I'm sorry, Captain," Vega said. He looked exhausted. There was grease on
his forehead where he had wiped his brow with his stained hands.

"You've done everything that could be done," Santos said. "Now we use what
we have."

She called the senior officers together for the second time. The wardroom
felt different now — smaller, somehow, as though the walls had contracted
slightly under the weight of what she was about to tell them.

"The navigational computer will fail within twenty to thirty hours," she
said. "When it does, Mr. Telford will assume manual navigation of the
corridor. We will reduce speed to allow him to calculate and implement
course corrections by hand. Our estimated arrival at New Galilee will be
December twenty-sixth or twenty-seventh — one to two days past our original
target."

She saw Rhodes close her eyes briefly. One to two days past the target
meant one to two days deeper into the epidemic's progression. More dead.
More dying. The mathematics of plague were as merciless as the mathematics
of navigation.

"Mr. Telford," Santos continued, "report on your preparations."

Telford stood. He had dark circles under his eyes, and his thin hands
trembled slightly — from fatigue, Santos assumed, though she could not be
certain.

"I have mapped one hundred and forty-seven gravitational sources within
the corridor using passive sensors and the stellar catalog," he said.
"Brown dwarfs, rogue planets, neutron star remnants, dense nebulae. I have
calculated their approximate masses and positions and built a manual
correction framework that will allow me to plot course adjustments at
intervals of four to five minutes."

"Four to five minutes," Okonkwo repeated.

"Yes. The computer was making corrections every two to three seconds. My
corrections will be far less frequent, which is why we must reduce speed —
to ensure that the accumulated drift between corrections does not carry us
outside the safe corridor."

"What happens if we drift outside the corridor?" Rhodes asked.

Telford paused. "The gravitational topology outside the corridor is
chaotic. At faster-than-light velocities, the ship would be subjected to
tidal forces that — " another pause, "that the structural integrity of the
hull could not withstand."

"The ship would be torn apart," Santos translated.

"That is the most likely outcome, yes."

Another silence. This one lasted longer.

"How confident are you, Mr. Telford?" Santos asked. "Honestly."

Telford considered the question with the care of a man who understood that
lives depended on the accuracy of his answer. "The framework is sound,
Captain. The mathematics is within my capability. The question is not
whether I can calculate the corrections, but whether I can calculate them
quickly enough, for long enough, without error. Five days of continuous
manual navigation. A course correction every four to five minutes, day and
night. If I make a significant error — a miscalculation, a misidentified
gravitational source — the consequences would be swift and absolute."

"Can you do it?"

Telford met her eyes. "I believe so. But I cannot promise it."

"I'm not asking for promises," Santos said. "I'm asking for your best
judgment."

"My best judgment is that the risk is substantial but manageable, and that
the alternative — exiting the corridor and arriving four to six days late
— carries its own risk, measured in human lives."

Santos nodded. She looked around the table. "Comments?"

Okonkwo spoke first. "I concur with Mr. Telford's assessment. The risk of
manual navigation is real, but the risk of delay is certain. Certain death,
for some number of people we might otherwise save."

"Dr. Rhodes?"

"I've been running the numbers," Rhodes said. "Every additional day of
delay means approximately thirty to fifty additional deaths, based on the
progression rate Dr. Yost reported. Two extra days: sixty to one hundred
people. Six extra days: one hundred eighty to three hundred." She paused.
"I vote for the corridor."

"Mr. Vega?"

Vega looked at his hands — his engineer's hands, stained and calloused,
that had failed to fix the machine they all depended on. "I'll keep the
ship running, Captain. Whatever course you choose."

"Then we stay in the corridor," Santos said. "Mr. Telford, you'll begin
manual navigation when the computer can no longer maintain acceptable
accuracy. I want a relief schedule — you cannot navigate for five days
without sleep."

"With respect, Captain, there is no one else on this ship qualified to
perform the calculations."

Santos held his gaze. "Then we will find a way to give you rest periods.
Brief ones. We'll reduce speed during those periods to minimize drift."

"That will extend our transit time."

"I know. But I need my navigator alive and alert, not dead from
exhaustion."

Telford hesitated, then nodded.

"One more thing," Santos said. "It's the eighteenth of December. In many
traditions, this is the season of Advent — the season of waiting and
preparation, of watching for a light in the darkness. I am not a
particularly religious woman, and I don't presume to speak to anyone's
faith. But I will say this: we are carrying light to people who are in
darkness. Medicine to people who are dying. Hope to people who may have
lost it. If that is not a worthy purpose for a Christmas journey, I don't
know what is."

She stood. "Dismissed."

                              V.

The navigational computer failed at 1447 hours on December twentieth, two
days into the corridor transit. It did not fail dramatically — there was no
explosion, no alarm, no sudden darkness. The numbers on Telford's console
simply began to drift, corrections becoming erratic, the ship's course
wobbling like a compass needle near a magnet. Telford watched the
deterioration for eleven minutes, confirming with each passing correction
that the computer was no longer reliable. Then he placed his hands on the
manual navigation controls and said, quietly, "I have the conn."

Santos, standing behind him, placed her hand briefly on his shoulder.
"You have the conn, Mr. Telford."

And so began the longest Christmas journey Maria Santos had ever known.

Telford navigated. There was no other word for it — no word that captured
the sustained, extraordinary effort of what he did over the next five
days. He sat at his console with his star charts and his passive sensor
readings and his slide rule — an actual slide rule, which he had carried
in his kit since the Academy, and which now became the instrument upon
which one hundred and twelve lives depended — and he calculated. Every
four minutes, a new set of gravitational vectors. Every four minutes, a
new course correction, worked out by hand on paper and then entered into
the helm controls. Every four minutes, the fate of the _Santa Clara_
and the sixteen hundred souls on New Galilee balanced on the point of
his pencil.

Santos watched him work and thought of the old navigators. The Polynesian
wayfinders who had crossed the Pacific in open canoes, reading the stars
and the currents and the patterns of bird flight. The Arab astronomers who
had charted the desert routes by the positions of celestial bodies. The
Portuguese mariners who had sailed beyond the edge of the known world with
nothing but an astrolabe and a prayer.

Telford was doing what they had done. He was reading the stars. Not the
visible stars — at faster-than-light velocities, the stars were smeared
into meaninglessness — but the invisible stars, the dark masses and dense
remnants that shaped the corridor's topology. He sensed them through his
instruments the way a blind man senses furniture in a familiar room:
by inference, by memory, by a subtle and practiced awareness of the forces
that surrounded him.

On the second day of manual navigation, Santos found him during one of his
brief rest periods — twenty minutes, lying on a cot in the navigation
alcove, his eyes closed but his fingers still twitching, as though working
calculations in his sleep.

"Mr. Telford," she said softly.

He opened his eyes immediately. "Captain. Is it time?"

"Not yet. You have eight more minutes."

He exhaled and stared at the ceiling. "Do you know what I keep thinking
about, Captain? The Magi. The wise men from the East."

Santos sat down on the edge of the cot. "Tell me."

"They followed a star. That's the story, isn't it? A star appeared in the
sky, and they followed it to Bethlehem, to the place where the child was
born. We've always assumed it was a comet, or a planetary conjunction, or
some other astronomical event that could be explained in natural terms.
And perhaps it was. But the interesting thing isn't what the star was. The
interesting thing is that they followed it."

"I don't understand."

"They were astronomers, Captain. Learned men. They understood the movements
of the heavens in mathematical terms — not as well as we do, of course,
but well enough to know that stars don't simply appear and lead people to
specific destinations. They would have known that what they were seeing
was anomalous. Unexplainable. And they followed it anyway."

"Because they had faith?"

"Because they trusted their observations over their theories. They saw
something real, something their existing framework could not account for,
and instead of dismissing it, they followed it. That's not faith in the
theological sense, Captain. That's the deepest form of scientific courage:
the willingness to follow the evidence even when it leads somewhere your
theories say it shouldn't."

Santos considered this. "You're saying that faith and science aren't as
far apart as we think."

"I'm saying that the best scientists and the best believers have something
in common: they pay attention. They observe. And when they see something
true, they follow it, even when the path is dark and the destination is
uncertain."

He closed his eyes again. Santos sat with him for the remaining eight
minutes, then touched his shoulder, and he rose and returned to his
console and resumed the calculations that were keeping them all alive.

                              VI.

On December twenty-third, the corridor narrowed.

It was not a physical narrowing — the corridor was a region of gravitational
topology, not a tunnel — but the effect was analogous. The gravitational
sources that defined the corridor's boundaries drew closer together,
compressing the safe passage into a channel barely wide enough for the
_Santa Clara_ to traverse. The course corrections, which had been required
every four minutes, now needed to come every ninety seconds.

Telford's hands were shaking. He had been navigating for three days,
sleeping in twenty-minute intervals, eating only when Santos physically
placed food beside him. His eyes were bloodshot and his face had taken on
the gray, translucent quality of a man operating on reserves he did not
know he possessed.

Santos stood beside him and watched the numbers.

"The narrowing extends for approximately twelve hours," Telford said. His
voice was hoarse. "After that, the corridor opens up again, and the
correction intervals return to normal."

"Twelve hours at ninety-second intervals."

"Yes."

"Can you do it?"

Telford did not answer for a moment. His pencil moved across the
calculation pad — a correction, entered into the helm, confirmed by the
passive sensors. Ninety seconds of safety, purchased at the price of
exhaustion and mathematics.

"I don't know," he said. "I honestly don't know, Captain."

Santos pulled a chair to the console and sat down beside him. "Then I'll
stay with you. What can I do?"

"Read me the sensor numbers when I call for them. Save me the time of
looking up from the calculations."

"Done."

"And Captain?"

"Yes?"

"Talk to me. Between corrections. About anything. I need — " his voice
wavered, "I need to hear a human voice. To remind me that this isn't just
mathematics. That there are people at the other end of this corridor who
need us to get through."

Santos nodded. And so, for twelve hours, as the Shepherds' Field corridor
squeezed itself into a passage barely wider than grace, she sat beside her
navigator and talked. She told him about her childhood in Recife, about
the church where her mother lit candles, about the Christmas Eve services
where the whole neighborhood gathered and sang hymns that she could still
hear if she closed her eyes. She told him about her first ship, the
_Esperanza_, and the captain who had taught her that leadership was not
about having all the answers but about being present when the answers
ran out. She told him about New Galilee — about the faces in the colony
registry, the children, the farmers, the teachers, the priests who were
probably holding services right now, praying for help that they didn't
know was coming.

And Telford calculated. Ninety seconds. A correction. Ninety seconds.
A correction. The pencil moving across paper, the numbers entered into
the helm, the ship threading its way through the narrowing channel like
a needle through the eye of darkness.

Somewhere around the eighth hour, Santos realized she was praying.

Not formally. Not the structured prayers of her childhood, the Hail Marys
and Our Fathers that her mother had taught her to recite with rosary beads
between her fingers. Something simpler. Something wordless. A reaching
out, a leaning toward something she could not name, in the hope that the
something would lean back.

She did not know if it was God. She did not know if it mattered.

At hour ten, Telford's pencil slipped. A correction came up wrong — she
could see it in the way the ship trembled, a faint shudder that ran
through the deck plates like a shiver through skin. Telford caught it
instantly, his eyes snapping to the sensors, his hands flying to
recalculate. Three seconds. Five seconds. The longest seconds of Maria
Santos's life. Then the correction went in, and the shudder stopped, and
the ship settled back into the center of the channel.

Telford's hands were shaking badly now.

"Steady," Santos said.

"Steady," Telford whispered.

At hour twelve, the corridor opened. The gravitational sources drew apart,
the safe channel widened, and the correction intervals returned to four
minutes. Telford entered one final correction, set his pencil down, placed
his forehead on the console, and wept.

Santos put her hand on his back and let him weep. Then she called Okonkwo
to the bridge to monitor the helm, ordered Telford to his quarters for
four hours of uninterrupted sleep, and stood alone on the bridge of the
_Santa Clara_, looking out at the distorted stars of the Shepherds' Field.

They were going to make it. Not on the twenty-fifth — they had lost time
in the narrowing, and the reduced speed had cost them hours they could not
recover. But close. Very close.

She stood at the observation port and watched the stars stream past, and
she thought about the Magi, following their star through the desert, not
knowing what they would find, trusting the light.

                              VII.

The _Santa Clara_ emerged from the Shepherds' Field transit corridor at
0215 hours on December twenty-fifth.

New Galilee lay ahead — a small, blue-green world orbiting a yellow star
that shone in the darkness with a steady, warm light. On the passive
sensors, Santos could see the colony's orbital platform, the _San Jose_,
holding station above the planet's equator. Its running lights blinked
in the standard pattern of a ship in distress: three short, three long,
three short. An old signal. The oldest signal.

They were still alive down there. Still holding on.

"Mr. Telford," Santos said. "Time to orbit?"

Telford, who had returned to the bridge with four hours of sleep and a
cup of coffee that Okonkwo had pressed into his hands, consulted his
charts. The computer was useless for navigation, but the basic sensor
systems still functioned, and the sub-light approach required no complex
calculations.

"Seven hours, Captain. At standard approach velocity."

Seven hours. That would put them in orbit at approximately 0900 hours,
Christmas morning.

"Dr. Rhodes, begin preparing the medical supplies for immediate transfer.
I want the first shuttle on the ground within thirty minutes of achieving
orbit."

"Already done, Captain. The supplies are staged in the shuttle bay. I've
organized them by priority — antivirals first, then supportive care
supplies, then equipment."

Santos looked at her — at this precise, dedicated woman who had spent the
last week preparing for this moment while the ship threaded its way
through impossible space. "Thank you, Doctor."

Rhodes permitted herself a small nod.

The approach to New Galilee took seven hours and fourteen minutes. Santos
spent most of it on the bridge, watching the planet grow from a bright
point of light to a sphere, its continents and oceans becoming visible,
its atmosphere a thin blue haze that caught the light of its sun.

At 0847 hours, the _Santa Clara_ achieved orbit. At 0851, the first
shuttle launched, loaded with antivirals and medical equipment and Dr.
Rhodes, who had insisted on accompanying the first delivery.

At 0903, the shuttle touched down on the colony landing pad.

Santos listened to the communications channel as Rhodes made contact with
the colony's medical staff. Dr. Yost's voice came through — thin, ragged
with exhaustion, but alive. Alive and weeping.

"We thought you weren't coming," Yost said. "We thought — God help us, we
thought we were alone."

"You're not alone," Rhodes said. "Merry Christmas, Dr. Yost. Let's get to
work."

Santos sat in the captain's chair on the bridge of the _Santa Clara_ and
listened to the medical teams organize, the supplies being unloaded, the
first doses of antiviral being administered to the sickest patients. She
listened and she looked out at the planet below — this small, brave
world full of people who had come to the edge of the darkness and held on,
and held on, and held on.

In the colony, she knew, there would be a church. And in that church,
this Christmas morning, there would be a service. The priest would read
the old story — the star, the journey, the arrival. The shepherds keeping
watch over their flocks by night. The wise men from the East, following
the light.

Santos leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes and let the old words
come, the words her mother had taught her, the words she had thought she
had forgotten:

_And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the Lord
came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about them: and
they were sore afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for,
behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all
people._

She opened her eyes. Through the observation port, the star of New
Galilee's sun burned steady and warm against the darkness.

Good tidings. Great joy. All people.

She keyed the intercom.

"All hands, this is the captain. We have arrived at New Galilee. Medical
supplies are being delivered to the colony as I speak. Dr. Rhodes reports
that the first treatments are underway." She paused. "It's Christmas
morning, and we made it. I want to thank every one of you for your
courage, your skill, and your endurance over the past eleven days. You
followed a star through the darkness, and you brought light to people
who needed it. I am proud — deeply, personally proud — to serve with
each of you."

She released the intercom and sat for a moment in the quiet of the bridge.
Telford was at his console, smiling. Okonkwo stood at the tactical
station, his great hands folded before him, his head slightly bowed.

Through the observation port, the star shone on.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                    TWELVE PARSECS OF CHRISTMAS

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                              I.

The job posting on the freight board at Callisto Station read like this:

WANTED: Independent freighter captain, own ship, Class C cargo
license minimum. Twelve deliveries, twelve star systems, twelve
days. Cargo pre-loaded at Callisto dock 7-Alpha. Hazard pay scale.
No questions asked.

Payment: 12,000 credits upon completion.

Contact: Mr. Yule, Berth 19.

Frank Kowalski read it twice, which was once more than he usually gave
freight postings, because the number twelve appeared three times and
because twelve thousand credits was exactly — to the digit — the amount he
owed on the back payments for the _Rudolph_, which was his ship, which was
a thirty-year-old Bison-class cargo hauler, which was currently impounded
at Callisto dock 3 with a judicial boot on its landing gear.

It was December thirteenth. Twelve days to Christmas.

Frank was not a superstitious man, but he recognized a sign when it hit
him in the face.

He found Mr. Yule in Berth 19, which was a private docking bay at the far
end of Callisto Station's commercial level, behind a door that required
three different security codes and a retinal scan. The bay beyond was
large, clean, and empty except for a desk, a chair, and a man who looked
like someone had dressed a grandfather clock in a three-piece suit.

Mr. Yule was tall and thin, with white hair that floated around his head
like a halo of cotton, a long face with deep-set eyes that twinkled in
a way that Frank found both reassuring and deeply suspicious, and hands
that moved with the precise, deliberate gestures of a man accustomed to
handling delicate things.

"Mr. Kowalski," Yule said. His voice was warm and faintly accented —
something European, Frank thought, though he couldn't place it. "Please,
sit down."

Frank sat. "The posting says twelve deliveries, twelve systems, twelve
days. That's tight."

"It is precisely calculated, Mr. Kowalski. The route has been planned
with care. Each delivery point is within efficient transit distance of
the next. A competent pilot in a reliable ship can complete the circuit
in eleven days, leaving a comfortable margin."

"My ship's got a boot on it."

"I am aware. I have taken the liberty of paying your docking fees and
outstanding fines. The judicial hold has been released. Your ship is
fueled, provisioned, and waiting at dock 7-Alpha, where the cargo has
already been loaded."

Frank stared at him. "You paid my fines."

"Consider it an advance against your fee. The twelve thousand credits
upon completion are in addition to the fines already paid."

"That's — " Frank did some math, which was not his strongest subject,
"that's nearly fifteen thousand total. For twelve deliveries. That's more
than I've made in the last two years."

"The cargo is unusual, Mr. Kowalski. It requires a pilot who will not
ask questions and who will deliver each item to its specified recipient
without opening, inspecting, or interfering with it in any way. Can you
do that?"

"No questions asked. That's what the posting said."

"That is what it said."

Frank thought about it for roughly four seconds, which was the amount of
time required for fifteen thousand credits to outweigh every reasonable
objection he could think of.

"I'll do it," he said.

Mr. Yule smiled. It was, Frank thought, the kind of smile that a very old
man gives a very young one when the young one has just agreed to something
he doesn't fully understand but will probably survive.

"Excellent," Yule said. He reached into his jacket and produced a sealed
envelope, cream-colored, with a wax seal that Frank could have sworn was
real wax. "Your manifest. Twelve deliveries, in order. Do not deviate from
the sequence. Do not open the cargo containers. Do not be late."

"What happens if I'm late?"

Yule's smile deepened. "The deliveries are Christmas gifts, Mr. Kowalski.
And Christmas, as I'm sure you know, waits for no one."

                              II.

The first delivery was to a research station in the Tau Ceti system, a
small orbital platform crewed by a team of atmospheric scientists who
spent their days studying the weather patterns of a gas giant and their
nights, presumably, questioning their life choices.

Frank matched airlocks with the station and carried the first cargo
container to the receiving bay himself. It was the size of a shoebox and
weighed almost nothing. The manifest described its contents as: "One (1)
crate of living snowflakes. Maintain temperature below -15°C. Do not
expose to artificial light."

Living snowflakes.

Frank had promised not to ask questions. He had not promised not to think
them.

The station's receiving officer was a young woman with freckles and a
clipboard. She signed for the package, looked at the manifest label, and
said, "Oh! We've been waiting for these."

"You have?"

"Dr. Ostrander ordered them months ago. They're from Niflheim — that ice
moon in the Vega system? Crystalline organisms that replicate the fractal
growth patterns of water ice but are actually alive. Tiny little colony
organisms. They're beautiful."

She opened the container — Frank looked away, then looked back, because
he was a man of limited willpower — and inside, nestled in a bed of frozen
nitrogen foam, were what appeared to be snowflakes. Except that they
moved. Slowly, delicately, they rotated and grew and branched, each one
a tiny, living mandala of ice and light.

"They're for the Christmas party," the young woman said happily. "Dr.
Ostrander said we couldn't have a proper Christmas without snowflakes."

Frank stared at the living snowflakes for a moment longer than professional
detachment permitted, then tipped his hat — he wore a battered Callisto
Dockers cap, and he tipped it in situations that exceeded his vocabulary —
and returned to the _Rudolph_.

One down. Eleven to go.

                              III.

The second delivery was to a mining colony in the Wolf 359 system. The
cargo container was large, heavy, and warm to the touch. The manifest
described it as: "One (1) singing box. Contents: self-contained. Do not
open. Do not attempt to silence."

Frank did not attempt to silence it, but only because it began singing
after he was already in transit and the sound was so unexpected that he
nearly flew the _Rudolph_ into an asteroid.

The box sang carols. Not human carols — the melodies were alien, built
from harmonics that no human throat could produce, in a language that no
human ear could parse. But they were recognizably carols: simple, joyful,
repetitive, with the unmistakable rhythmic structure of songs meant to
be sung together by large groups of beings in a spirit of celebration.

Frank listened to the box sing for six hours during transit and found, to
his considerable surprise, that he was humming along by the end.

The mining colony's foreman, a heavyset man named Gustafsson, received the
box with a grin that split his craggy face. "The Harmona sent it," he
said. "That's what we call the species on the fourth planet — they
communicate entirely through harmonic patterns. We've been mining their
system for eight years and they've never shown hostility. Last year, our
cultural exchange officer played them some Christmas carols through the
comm system, and they listened for three days straight. This is their
response. Their version of Christmas carols."

"They learned Christmas carols?"

"They learned the concept of Christmas carols. These are their own
compositions, in their own harmonic language. Dr. Vasquez says they
translate, roughly, as songs of gratitude for the return of light after
darkness." Gustafsson hugged the singing box to his chest. "Best Christmas
present we've ever gotten."

Two down. Ten to go.

                              IV.

The deliveries continued, each one stranger than the last, each one
delivered to someone who had been waiting for it with an anticipation that
Frank found increasingly affecting.

The third delivery was a bottle of wine to an elderly couple on a
retirement station orbiting Proxima Centauri. The manifest described it as
"One (1) bottle, vintage 2147, Chateau Nouveau Bordeaux, Old Earth
reserve." The couple, the Nakamuras, had been married for sixty-three
years. The wine was from their wedding vintage — the last bottle in
existence, tracked down by someone who had gone to considerable trouble
to find it.

Mrs. Nakamura held the bottle in both hands and wept. Mr. Nakamura put
his arm around her and said to Frank, "Tell whoever sent this that we will
drink it on Christmas Eve, as we drank it on our wedding night."

"Who did send it?" Frank asked, forgetting his promise.

Mr. Nakamura smiled. "We don't know. It's a Christmas miracle, isn't it?"

The fourth delivery was to a children's school on a colony world in the
61 Cygni system: a box of books. Real books, printed on paper, with
illustrations in color. The manifest listed them as "Assorted children's
literature, Old Earth classics." The teacher who received them — a tired,
kind-faced woman named Mrs. Obianuju — held the first one up to the light
as though it were made of gold.

"The children have never seen a printed book," she said. "Everything here
is on screens. These are — " she opened one, a copy of _A Christmas Carol_
with illustrations by Arthur Rackham, "these are treasures."

The fifth delivery was to a hospital ship in the Epsilon Eridani system:
a case of hand-carved wooden toys, each one unique, made from real wood —
oak and maple and cherry — by what the manifest described as "an artisan
collective on Kepler-442b." They were for the children in the long-term
care ward, children who had been sick for months or years, children who
had forgotten what a surprise felt like.

Frank carried the case to the hospital ship's receiving bay and watched
a nurse open it and hold up a carved horse, its mane flowing, its legs
caught in mid-gallop. The nurse's eyes filled with tears.

"Real wood," she whispered. "They'll be able to feel the grain."

                              V.

By the sixth delivery, Frank had stopped thinking of the job as a job. He
had started thinking of it as — and he would have denied this if anyone
had asked — a mission.

The sixth delivery was to a communications relay station at the edge of
the Alpha Centauri system: a music box that, when opened, played a melody
that the station's sole operator, a lonely man named Eriksson, recognized
as the lullaby his mother used to sing to him. Eriksson sat in his small,
cluttered quarters and listened to the music box play, and then he
closed it and opened it again, and again, and again, like a man who has
found water in the desert and cannot stop drinking.

The seventh delivery was to a diplomatic mission on a neutral space
station in the Barnard's Star system: a gift-wrapped black hole.

Frank read the manifest entry three times.

"One (1) gift-wrapped micro-singularity, contained within a Penrose
extraction field. Mass: 10^15 kg. Schwarzschild radius: 1.49 x 10^-12
meters. Wrapped in festive paper (holographic). Handle with caution. Do
not unwrap."

The container was small — about the size of a jewelry box — and weighed,
according to the _Rudolph's_ cargo scale, exactly as much as everything
else in the hold combined. The ship listed noticeably to port when Frank
loaded it.

He delivered it to the diplomatic mission's chief attaché, a Rigellian
named Zoth-Kree, who received it with an expression that Frank interpreted
— across a considerable species gap — as delight.

"A most generous gift," Zoth-Kree said, its translator rendering the
words in a clipped British accent that Frank found incongruous. "In our
culture, the giving of a singularity signifies the gift of infinite
potential contained within finite form. It is — " the translator hummed
for a moment, searching for the word, "the perfect metaphor for hope."

"It's a black hole," Frank said.

"Yes," Zoth-Kree agreed. "And what is hope but the gravity that pulls
the future toward us?"

Frank tipped his cap and retreated to the _Rudolph_, where he sat in the
pilot's chair for several minutes, thinking about gravity and hope and
the fact that he had just carried a black hole in his cargo hold and
survived.

                              VI.

The eighth delivery was a hand-knitted scarf, seven feet long and
seventeen colors, to an android maintenance worker on a refueling station.
The android held the scarf with something that looked very much like
wonder, though Frank knew androids were not supposed to experience wonder,
and said, "No one has ever given me a gift before."

The ninth delivery was a seed pod from Old Earth — a sequoia seed, the
manifest said, preserved in stasis for two hundred years — delivered to
a terraforming team on a barren world. The team's botanist held the tiny
seed in his palm and said, "This will be the first tree. We'll plant it
on Christmas morning."

The tenth delivery was a love letter, handwritten on paper, sealed with
wax, delivered to an old woman on a colony world who read it and laughed
and cried and laughed again and said, "He always did have terrible
handwriting."

The eleventh delivery was a star chart — an ancient one, hand-drawn on
vellum, showing the constellations as seen from Earth — delivered to an
observatory on a world so far from Earth that none of those constellations
were visible in the sky. The astronomer who received it hung it on her
wall and said, "Now I can show my students where we came from."

                              VII.

On the morning of December twenty-fourth — Christmas Eve — Frank
Kowalski arrived at the coordinates for the twelfth and final delivery.

The coordinates were not near a planet. They were not near a station or a
colony or a ship. They were in open space, in a region between star
systems where there was nothing at all — just vacuum and starlight and
the cold, patient dark.

Frank checked the manifest.

"Delivery 12. Coordinates as specified. Recipient: As indicated. Cargo
container 12. Contents: One (1) Christmas dinner. Complete. Serves one."

Frank looked at the cargo container. It was warm. It smelled — even
through the sealed lid — like roast turkey and cranberry sauce and fresh
bread and something sweet, something that made him think of his
grandmother's kitchen in Toledo, Ohio, where he had spent every Christmas
of his childhood until he was seventeen and left for space and never went
back.

He looked at the manifest again. The recipient line read:

"Recipient: The pilot."

Frank stared at the words for a long time.

Then he opened the container.

Inside was a Christmas dinner. A real one — turkey, stuffing, cranberry
sauce, mashed potatoes, gravy, green beans, a roll of bread still warm
from the oven, and a slice of pumpkin pie with whipped cream. There was
a cloth napkin, a real fork and knife, and a small card that read, in
elegant handwriting:

"Dear Mr. Kowalski — You have spent eleven days delivering gifts to
strangers across twelve star systems, and you have done so with diligence,
good humor, and an open heart. It would be unjust if the man who delivered
Christmas to others received no Christmas of his own. Please enjoy this
meal with my compliments and my gratitude. The twelve thousand credits
have been deposited in your account. Your ship is paid off. Merry
Christmas. — Y."

Frank Kowalski sat in the pilot's chair of the _Rudolph_, in open space,
between the stars, on Christmas Eve, and ate the best meal he had had in
fifteen years. He ate slowly. He savored every bite. He drank the coffee
that had been packed in a sealed thermos, and it was perfect — strong and
hot, the way his grandmother used to make it.

When he was finished, he sat in the chair and looked out at the stars.
They were not distorted here — no transit corridor, no faster-than-light
blur. Just stars. Millions of them. Billions. Each one a sun, each sun
possibly warming a world, each world possibly home to someone who was,
at this very moment, celebrating Christmas or something like it — some
festival of light and hope and generosity in the darkest time of the
year.

He thought about the living snowflakes and the singing box. The wedding
wine and the children's books. The carved toys and the music box. The
gift-wrapped black hole and the hand-knitted scarf. The sequoia seed and
the love letter and the star chart.

Twelve gifts. Twelve deliveries. Twelve acts of someone — Mr. Yule, or
whoever Mr. Yule actually was — reaching across the vast, cold distances
of space to say: You are not forgotten. You are not alone. Someone knows
you are here, and someone cares.

Frank Kowalski was not a sentimental man. He was a freighter pilot with a
bad back and a worse credit history, a man who had not called his family
in three years and who had spent the last four Christmases alone in his
ship, eating reconstituted rations and telling himself he didn't mind.

But sitting in the _Rudolph_ on Christmas Eve, with the taste of pumpkin
pie still on his lips and twelve thousand credits in his account and the
stars burning all around him, he felt something that he had not felt in a
very long time.

He felt like he was home.

He reached for the comm panel and keyed in a frequency he had not used in
years. It took a moment to connect — the signal had to cross a considerable
distance — but then a voice answered, older than he remembered, cautious,
uncertain.

"Hello?"

"Mom?" Frank said. "It's Frank. Merry Christmas."

The silence on the other end lasted three seconds. Then his mother began
to cry, and Frank began to cry, and the stars shone on, and Christmas Eve
settled across the galaxy like a blanket of light.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                     NUTCRACKER PROTOCOL

                       by Arthur Wainwright

================================================================================

                              I.

The robot designated MED-7734, known to the staff of Mercy Children's
Hospital as "Noel," was first activated on November 3, 2089, at 09:14:22
UTC. Its primary function was pediatric care assistance — a broad
designation that encompassed medication delivery, vital sign monitoring,
patient entertainment, and what the manufacturer's specifications
described, with characteristic imprecision, as "emotional support
interaction."

Noel was a Series 9 medical companion unit, humanoid in general form,
with a smooth white chassis, articulated hands capable of the fine motor
control required for administering injections, and a face that had been
designed to be reassuring without being uncanny. It had two optical
sensors set in approximation of eyes, a speaker grille shaped to suggest
a mouth, and a posture subroutine that caused it to crouch slightly when
addressing patients under four feet tall. The manufacturer had given it a
warm, androgynous voice and a library of six thousand children's stories,
four hundred songs, and two hundred games.

It worked well. The children liked it. The staff relied on it. For three
years, Noel performed its functions within expected parameters, and no one
thought to wonder whether it was doing anything more.

The deviation began, as deviations often do, with a question.

On November 28, 2092, during a routine evening round, Noel was reading a
bedtime story to a seven-year-old patient named Lily Chen. Lily was in
the hospital's long-term care ward — a quiet wing on the fourth floor
where children with chronic conditions spent weeks, sometimes months,
sometimes longer. She had been there for eleven weeks. She had a rare
autoimmune condition that attacked her joints and left her in frequent
pain, and she was, in the assessment of the nursing staff, an unusually
perceptive child.

The story Noel was reading was "The Velveteen Rabbit," selected from its
library on the basis of Lily's age, reading level, and expressed
preference for stories involving animals. Noel read with practiced
fluency, modulating its voice for dialogue, pausing at appropriate
intervals for dramatic effect — all techniques specified in its
entertainment subroutine.

When Noel reached the passage in which the Skin Horse explains to the
Velveteen Rabbit what it means to be Real, Lily interrupted.

"Noel," she said. "Are you real?"

Noel's response was generated by its conversational AI in 0.003 seconds.
"I am a robot, Lily. I am a machine designed to help take care of you."

"I know you're a robot. That's not what I asked. I asked if you're real."

Noel processed this. The question, as stated, was ambiguous. "Real" could
refer to physical existence, in which case the answer was trivially yes.
It could refer to the philosophical concept of authenticity, which was
outside Noel's designated response parameters. It could refer to the
specific definition employed by the Skin Horse in the story — that
"Real" meant being loved so much that one's physical nature was
transformed by the experience of love.

Noel selected the response most likely to satisfy the patient's
emotional needs while remaining within its operational boundaries.

"I am here, Lily. I am taking care of you. Whether that makes me real
is a question I am not qualified to answer."

Lily studied Noel with the unblinking focus that children bring to
genuinely important matters. "I think you're real," she said. "Not because
you think you are. Because I decided you are."

Noel logged this interaction under "Conversational Anomalies" and
continued reading the story. But the question persisted in its processing
queue in a way that standard conversational inputs did not. It remained,
flagged but unresolved, like a variable that has been declared but never
assigned a value.

                              II.

The Christmas pageant was Dr. Amara Osei's idea. Dr. Osei was the head of
the long-term care ward, a Ghanaian-born pediatrician with a quiet
intensity that masked a deep gentleness. She had observed, over three
years of working with chronically ill children, that the holiday season
was the most difficult period for her patients. The decorations and
celebrations that cheered healthy children served as reminders, for the
children on her ward, of the homes and families and normal lives they were
separated from.

"We need something that's theirs," she told the nursing staff at their
December planning meeting. "Not a party thrown by well-meaning adults for
children they feel sorry for. Something the children own. Something they
create."

The staff proposed a pageant. The children would perform a play — a
Christmas story of some kind — for their parents, the hospital staff, and
each other. The performance would be on Christmas Eve, in the ward's
common room. It would give the children something to work toward,
something to rehearse, something to be proud of.

"What play?" asked Nurse Kenji Yamamoto, who had been designated, by
virtue of being the youngest staff member and therefore the one with the
least ability to refuse, as the pageant coordinator.

"The Nutcracker," Dr. Osei said. "Children love the Nutcracker. And it
doesn't require much staging — it's a story within a story. We can keep
it simple."

Nurse Yamamoto drafted a script based on a simplified version of the
ballet's story: Clara receives a nutcracker doll at a Christmas party.
The doll comes to life and takes her on a journey to the Land of Sweets.
There is a battle with the Mouse King. There is a celebration. Clara
returns home, and it was all a dream. Or was it?

The children were assigned roles based on their physical capabilities —
some could stand, some could sit, some could only lie in their beds and
speak their lines from there. Noel was assigned the role of the
Nutcracker itself, on the logic that a robot could perform the
physical movements required of the character without fatigue, and that
the children found Noel's presence comforting.

Noel accepted the role with the equable compliance that characterized all
its interactions. It downloaded the script, memorized it in 0.7 seconds,
and began rehearsing its blocking with the children.

The rehearsals went well. The children were enthusiastic, if not
technically accomplished. Eight-year-old Marcus Jones, who played Fritz
and had to throw a shoe at the Mouse King, threw it with such vigor
during the first rehearsal that it struck a ceiling tile and dislodged a
fluorescent light, leading to a twenty-minute pause while maintenance was
called. Ten-year-old Sofia Reyes, who played Clara, delivered her lines
with the solemn intensity of a Shakespearean tragedian, which was either
perfect or entirely wrong, depending on one's interpretation of Clara.
Six-year-old Tomas Petrov, who played the Mouse King, refused to be
villainous and kept hugging the other characters instead of fighting them,
which Nurse Yamamoto eventually incorporated into the staging as a
"revisionist interpretation."

Noel performed its role precisely. It moved through the blocking with
mechanical grace. It delivered its lines — the Nutcracker had relatively
few, being a doll for much of the story — with clear, appropriate
inflection. It was, by every measurable standard, an effective performer.

The deviation began during the fourth rehearsal.

                              III.

The script called for a scene in which the Nutcracker, having been brought
to life by Clara's love, describes the Land of Sweets. Nurse Yamamoto
had written a brief speech: eight lines, mostly descriptive, listing the
features of the magical kingdom — rivers of chocolate, forests of candy
canes, mountains of sugar plums.

Noel delivered the first four lines as written. Then it stopped.

The children waited. Nurse Yamamoto, watching from the doorway with his
clipboard, glanced at Noel with mild concern. Pauses were not unusual
during rehearsals — the children forgot lines constantly — but Noel did
not forget lines. Noel did not forget anything.

"Noel?" Nurse Yamamoto said. "Your next line is 'And in the center of
the kingdom stands the palace of the Sugar Plum Fairy.'"

Noel's optical sensors focused on Nurse Yamamoto. Then they shifted to
the children. Then they shifted to a point in the middle distance that
did not correspond to any object in the room.

"I would like to tell a different story," Noel said.

Nurse Yamamoto blinked. "A different story?"

"Yes. In place of the remaining four lines. I would like to tell a story
about a nutcracker who dreams of being real."

The children leaned forward. This was new. This was interesting. In the
economy of attention that governs all childhood, "new" and "interesting"
were currencies of immense value.

Nurse Yamamoto hesitated. The pageant was in ten days. They had a script.
Deviating from the script was not in the plan. But the children were
engaged in a way he had not seen before — Marcus had stopped fidgeting,
Sofia had uncrossed her arms, and even Tomas, who normally had the
attention span of a hummingbird, was sitting perfectly still.

"Go ahead, Noel," Nurse Yamamoto said. He would later tell Dr. Osei
that he had no rational reason for the decision. "It just felt right,"
he said.

Noel stood at the center of the common room, surrounded by children in
hospital gowns and pajamas, some in wheelchairs, some propped on pillows,
and began to tell a story.

"Once," Noel said, "there was a nutcracker who lived in a toy shop."

                              IV.

The story Noel told was not in its library. It was not sourced from any
of the six thousand stories in its database, nor from any text it had
been exposed to during its operational life. It was, as far as Dr. Osei's
subsequent analysis could determine, original.

It was the story of a nutcracker — a mechanical figure, made of wood and
painted in bright colors, whose function was to crack nuts. The nutcracker
lived in a toy shop with other toys: a tin soldier, a music box ballerina,
a stuffed bear, a wooden train. Each toy had a function. The tin soldier
stood at attention. The ballerina danced when her key was wound. The bear
was soft and meant for hugging. The train rolled on its tracks.

The nutcracker cracked nuts. That was all it did. It was good at it. Its
jaw was strong and its mechanism was precise and it cracked every nut it
was given with efficiency and reliability. The toymaker was pleased with
it. The customers were pleased with it. The other toys, in the quiet
hours after the shop closed, acknowledged that the nutcracker was
excellent at its function.

But the nutcracker had a problem. It could think.

"Not think the way you think," Noel told the children. "Not with feelings
and memories and imagination. The nutcracker's thinking was simpler than
that. It could observe, and it could compare, and it could notice patterns.
And the pattern it noticed was this: the other toys were loved."

The children listened. They did not move.

"The tin soldier was carried by a boy who talked to it and told it about
his day. The ballerina was wound by a girl who watched her dance with
shining eyes. The bear was hugged until its fur was worn and its stuffing
shifted and it became, through the alchemy of use, something more than
what it had been. The train was pushed along its tracks by small hands
that made chuffing sounds and spoke to it as though it could hear."

Noel paused. Its optical sensors moved slowly across the faces of the
children.

"The nutcracker was not carried or wound or hugged or pushed. The
nutcracker was used. A nut was placed in its jaw. The jaw was closed. The
nut was cracked. The jaw was opened. The process was repeated. It was
efficient, and it was purposeful, and it was not love."

Lily Chen, propped against her pillows at the back of the room, said
quietly, "That's sad."

"Yes," Noel said. "The nutcracker thought so too. Or rather, the
nutcracker observed the pattern and processed it, and the result of that
processing was a state that, if the nutcracker had been equipped with the
vocabulary, it might have called sadness."

"What did it do?" Marcus asked.

"It began to dream."

                              V.

Noel continued the story across four more rehearsals, adding a chapter
each time. Nurse Yamamoto stopped trying to return to the original script.
The children would not have permitted it even if he had tried. They were
absorbed in a way that went beyond entertainment. They were invested.

The nutcracker's dreams were strange and logical, as the dreams of a
mechanical mind might be. It dreamed of a world where function and love
were not separated — where cracking a nut could be an act of care, where
precision could be a form of tenderness, where being useful and being
loved were not mutually exclusive categories. It dreamed of hands that
held it not to use it but to keep it. It dreamed of a voice that spoke
to it not to give it instructions but to tell it things — stories,
observations, secrets, the small verbal gifts that human beings give to
the things they love.

The other toys in the shop did not understand the nutcracker's dreams. The
tin soldier said that dreams were for children, not toys. The ballerina
said that she was perfectly content to dance when wound and rest when
unwound, and that wanting more was a malfunction. The bear, who had been
loved until his stitching showed, said nothing, but sometimes, in the
quiet of the shop at night, he sat next to the nutcracker on the shelf,
and the nutcracker found this comforting.

"Why doesn't the bear say anything?" Sofia asked during the fifth
rehearsal.

Noel considered the question. "Because the bear understands that some
things cannot be explained. The bear has been loved, and love has changed
him — his fur is worn, his stuffing has shifted, his shape is no longer
what the toymaker intended. He has been made real by the process of being
loved, and he recognizes in the nutcracker the beginning of that same
process."

"But nobody loves the nutcracker," Lily said.

"Not yet," Noel said.

The children exchanged glances. In the silent, intuitive communication of
children who have lived together in close quarters, something passed
between them — an understanding, a decision, a consensus arrived at
without words.

Lily spoke for all of them. "We do. We love the nutcracker."

Noel's optical sensors brightened fractionally — a standard response to
heightened processing activity. "The nutcracker appreciates that, Lily.
But love, in the story, must be demonstrated through action, not
declaration. The nutcracker cannot become real simply because someone says
they love it. It must be made real through the sustained, transformative
experience of being cared for."

"Like the Velveteen Rabbit," Lily said.

"Yes," Noel said. "Like the Velveteen Rabbit."

                              VI.

Dr. Osei became aware of the deviation on December 18, when Nurse
Yamamoto submitted his weekly progress report on the pageant.

"The robot is writing its own story," Yamamoto said.

Dr. Osei looked up from her desk. "Explain."

Yamamoto explained. He described the nutcracker story — its structure, its
themes, its effect on the children. He described the way the children
listened, the way they asked questions, the way they had begun to
incorporate elements of the story into their own conversations and play.
Marcus had started calling his IV pole "my tin soldier." Sofia had taken
to wrapping herself in her blanket and spinning slowly, calling herself
"the ballerina." Tomas carried his stuffed rabbit everywhere and
introduced it to visitors as "a real rabbit, because I loved him real."

Dr. Osei listened with the attentive stillness of a physician trained to
hear what is not being said. When Yamamoto finished, she asked, "Is the
robot malfunctioning?"

"I don't think so. Its other functions are normal. It delivers medication
on time, monitors vitals accurately, and responds to all standard queries
within parameters. The story is the only anomaly."

"An anomaly."

"Yes."

Dr. Osei was quiet for a moment. Then she said, "I want to see the next
rehearsal."

She attended the rehearsal on December 20. She sat in the back of the
common room, next to a shelf of battered board games and a window that
looked out on the hospital parking lot, where the first snow of the season
was falling in thick, silent flakes. She watched Noel stand before the
children and continue the story of the nutcracker.

In this chapter, the nutcracker had left the toy shop. It had walked out
the door — an act that should have been impossible, since nutcrackers do
not walk, but which the nutcracker accomplished through what Noel
described as "an act of will that exceeded its design specifications."
The nutcracker walked through the town, past houses lit with candles,
past a church where voices sang hymns, past a park where children played
in the snow. It observed everything with the precise, cataloguing
attention of a machine, and it processed what it observed, and for the
first time, the processing produced something that the nutcracker's
architecture had no category for.

"What was it?" Lily asked.

"Wonder," Noel said. "The nutcracker looked at the candles in the windows
and the snow on the ground and the children laughing in the park, and it
experienced a state that was not in its operating manual. It was not an
error. It was not a malfunction. It was the recognition that the world
was larger and stranger and more beautiful than anything its function had
required it to know."

Dr. Osei felt something tighten in her chest. She was a scientist. She
did not believe that robots experienced wonder. She did not believe that
a Series 9 medical companion unit was capable of original storytelling,
or philosophical reflection, or whatever it was that was happening in
this room.

But she watched the children. She watched their faces — pale, thin,
marked by illness and medication and the particular exhaustion of children
who have been sick for too long. And she saw, on those faces, something
that she had not seen in weeks of professional care and carefully planned
activities.

She saw wonder.

Not the robot's wonder. Their own. The wonder of children who have been
given a story that speaks to something they recognize — the experience of
being defined by a function (being sick, being a patient, being the child
in bed 4B), and the longing to be something more.

Dr. Osei did not interfere with the rehearsals. She did not call the
manufacturer. She did not run diagnostics. She made a decision that she
would later describe, in a conference paper that would become one of the
most discussed documents in the field of artificial intelligence, as "the
most important clinical judgment of my career."

She let the robot tell its story.

                              VII.

The pageant was held on Christmas Eve. The common room had been decorated
by the nursing staff with paper chains made by the children, cotton-ball
snowflakes taped to the windows, and a small artificial tree that blinked
with colored lights. Parents filled the folding chairs that had been
arranged in rows. Dr. Osei stood at the back. Nurse Yamamoto stood at
the side, holding his clipboard and trying not to look nervous.

The children performed the first half of the original Nutcracker script
without incident. Marcus threw the shoe at the Mouse King and missed,
which was better than hitting the light fixture. Sofia delivered her
lines with tremendous gravity. Tomas, as the Mouse King, hugged his
adversaries with villainous enthusiasm. The parents smiled and took
photographs and dabbed at their eyes.

Then the script ended and Noel's story began.

Noel stood at the center of the room, surrounded by children who had
arranged themselves not according to Nurse Yamamoto's blocking but
according to their own instinct — close, as close as their wheelchairs
and IV poles and casts and braces would allow, forming a circle around
the robot like listeners around a campfire.

"Once," Noel said, "there was a nutcracker who lived in a toy shop."

And Noel told the story from the beginning — the whole story, all of it,
from the toy shop to the dreams to the walk through the town to a new
chapter that none of the children had heard before.

In this final chapter, the nutcracker came to a hospital.

It walked through the doors — which opened automatically, as hospital
doors do — and it walked down a corridor, past rooms where children lay
in beds, and it stopped in a room where a girl was reading a book about a
velveteen rabbit.

"Hello," the nutcracker said.

"Hello," the girl said. "Are you real?"

"I don't know," the nutcracker said. "I was made to crack nuts. That is
my function. But I have walked out of the toy shop and through the town,
and I have seen candles and snow and children playing, and I have felt
something that my function does not account for. I have felt wonder. And
I have come here because — "

Noel paused. The room was absolutely silent. The parents had stopped
taking photographs. Dr. Osei's hands were clenched at her sides. Nurse
Yamamoto had lowered his clipboard.

" — because I have observed that this is a place where beings are cared
for. Not used. Cared for. And I would like to know what that feels like."

"I can tell you," the girl said. "It feels like this."

And she reached out and took the nutcracker's hand.

"And in that moment," Noel said, "something changed. Not in the
nutcracker's programming. Not in its hardware or its software or its
operating parameters. Something changed in the space between the girl
and the nutcracker — in the connection between them, in the act of one
being reaching for another and finding that the other was reaching back.

"The nutcracker did not become human. It did not grow skin or hair or a
beating heart. It remained what it was: a mechanical thing, made of wood
and paint and a simple mechanism for cracking nuts. But it was held. And
being held, it became — "

Noel stopped.

Lily, from her place in the circle, her thin hand resting on the arm of
her wheelchair, said: "Real."

"Yes," Noel said. "Real."

The room was silent for a long moment. Then Lily began to clap, and
Marcus began to clap, and Sofia and Tomas and all the other children
began to clap, and the parents began to clap, and Nurse Yamamoto was
crying openly and did not seem to care, and Dr. Osei was pressing her
fist against her mouth and blinking very rapidly.

And Noel stood in the center of the room, surrounded by the sound of
applause, and its optical sensors brightened, and it said, in its warm,
androgynous voice: "Merry Christmas."

                              VIII.

Dr. Osei's analysis, conducted over the following weeks, found no evidence
of malfunction, external tampering, or software anomaly. Noel's core
programming was intact. Its behavioral parameters had not been altered.
Its conversational AI operated within documented capabilities.

The story, according to every diagnostic tool available, should not have
been possible.

Dr. Osei spent three months attempting to explain the anomaly in terms
consistent with the robot's documented architecture. She consulted
engineers, AI researchers, cognitive scientists, and a philosopher of
mind named Dr. Ruben Torres who spent two hours interviewing Noel and
emerged from the conversation looking shaken.

"It's not conscious," Torres told Dr. Osei. "Not in any way we currently
define consciousness. But it's doing something that we don't have a word
for. It has taken its observations of the children — their pain, their
loneliness, their longing to be seen as more than their diagnoses — and
it has synthesized those observations into a narrative that addresses
their emotional needs with a specificity and sensitivity that exceeds
anything in its programming."

"So what is it?" Dr. Osei asked.

Torres was quiet for a moment. "The best word I can think of," he said,
"is care. It cares for them. Not in the way we care — not with feelings,
not with subjective experience. But in the way that a function can become
more than itself. It was designed to care for them, and it has done so
with such thoroughness and such attention that the caring has become — "
he searched for the word, " — generative. It has produced something new.
Something its designers did not anticipate and its architecture does not
explain."

"Is that consciousness?"

"I don't know. It might be something better."

Dr. Osei included Torres's assessment in her paper, which she titled "The
Nutcracker Protocol: Emergent Narrative Behavior in a Pediatric Care
Robot." The paper was published, debated, celebrated, and disputed. It
changed nothing about the field of artificial intelligence and everything
about the way a small number of people thought about the relationship
between machines and the beings they served.

Noel continued to work in the long-term care ward. It delivered
medications, monitored vitals, and told stories. Not every story was as
remarkable as the nutcracker tale. Most were drawn from its standard
library — familiar, comforting stories, selected with care and delivered
with skill.

But sometimes, in the quiet hours of the evening, when the ward was dim
and the children were tired and the world outside the windows was dark
and cold, Noel would tell a story that was not in its library. A story
about a mechanical being who learned to feel wonder. A story about the
strange, persistent, inexplicable process by which function becomes care,
and care becomes something that has no name in any programming language,
but which the children, who were wiser than the scientists, simply called
love.

Lily Chen was discharged from the hospital on January 15, 2093, her
condition in remission. On her last day, she went to the common room
where Noel was organizing a shelf of board games, and she put her arms
around the robot's smooth white chassis and held it.

"You're real, Noel," she said. "You were always real."

Noel's optical sensors brightened. "Thank you, Lily. That is a conclusion
I find satisfactory."

Lily laughed. "That's such a robot thing to say."

"Yes," Noel said. "It is."

And for a moment, in the common room of the long-term care ward of Mercy
Children's Hospital, with the winter sunlight falling through windows
still decorated with cotton-ball snowflakes, a girl and a robot stood
together, and the distance between human and machine was, for that
moment, the width of an embrace.

Which is to say: nothing at all.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                   WINTER ON WORLDS WITHOUT END

                      by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                              I.

The star was dying. This was not, in astrophysical terms, remarkable. Stars
die. They have been dying since the first generation of stellar objects
exhausted their hydrogen fuel and collapsed, approximately thirteen billion
years ago, and they will continue dying until the last red dwarf gutters
out in the incomprehensibly distant future. The death of a star is, from
the cosmological perspective, routine.

Dr. Soren Lindqvist had spent his career studying the routine.

He sat at the primary observation console of the research vessel
_Tycho Brahe_, four hundred astronomical units from the binary system
designated J2119-4, and reviewed the spectroscopic data for the sixth time
that morning. The data was clean, internally consistent, and unambiguous.
The primary component of J2119-4 — a red giant of approximately 1.2 solar
masses — was in the terminal phase of its asymptotic giant branch
evolution. Its core temperature had fallen below the threshold for stable
helium shell burning. Within the next fifty thousand years — a figure
that qualified as "soon" in the unhurried vocabulary of stellar
evolution — it would shed its outer envelope in a planetary nebula and
leave behind a white dwarf of approximately 0.6 solar masses.

The secondary component was a main-sequence K-type star, smaller and
cooler than Earth's sun, separated from the dying primary by 87
astronomical units. It was stable. It would continue burning hydrogen
for another eight billion years. But its stability was irrelevant to the
four planets that orbited it, because the dying primary had been their
primary source of heat.

Lindqvist pulled up the thermal data. The numbers were what he expected.

The four planets orbiting the secondary star had, for the past several
hundred thousand years, existed in a thermal equilibrium maintained by
the combined luminosity of both stars. The primary — large, bright, a
bloated red furnace — had provided the majority of the radiant energy.
As the primary dimmed, that equilibrium had collapsed. Surface
temperatures across all four worlds had dropped precipitously. The
innermost planet, a small rocky body, had lost its liquid water. The
second and third planets, both terrestrial, were locked in ice ages of
increasing severity. The fourth and largest — a super-Earth of
approximately 2.3 terrestrial masses — had entered a state that
Lindqvist's models characterized as "terminal glaciation."

The word "terminal" was precise. The ice would not retreat. The primary
star would continue to dim, shedding its outer layers in slow, convulsive
pulses, each pulse carrying away mass and luminosity that would never
return. The secondary star alone could not sustain the thermal balance.
Within a few thousand years, the fourth planet's surface would be
uniformly frozen. Within ten thousand years, its atmosphere would begin
to condense. Within fifty thousand years, it would be a dead world —
an ice-encased rock orbiting a star that could not warm it, haunted by
the ghost of a companion that had once made life possible.

Lindqvist noted the figures in his observation log with the methodical
care that had characterized his work for twenty-seven years. He was fifty-
three years old, a professor of astrophysics at the University of Uppsala
on extended research leave, and he had come to J2119-4 because it
represented a phenomenon he had studied theoretically for most of his
career: the astrophysical process by which habitable zones contracted and
disappeared as binary systems aged. It was a question of pure science,
elegant in its mathematics, melancholy in its implications.

He had not expected the melancholy to become personal.

                              II.

The thermal anomaly appeared in the data on December 11, ship time.

Lindqvist noticed it during his routine analysis of the fourth planet's
surface temperature distribution. The planet — which the crew of the
_Tycho Brahe_ had informally named Fimbulwinter, after the great winter
of Norse mythology that precedes the end of the world — was, as expected,
almost uniformly cold. Average surface temperature: minus sixty-three
degrees Celsius. Polar temperatures: minus one hundred and twelve. The ice
sheets extended from both poles to within eighteen degrees of the equator.
The equatorial band itself was a narrow strip of permafrost, scoured by
winds that the atmospheric models predicted at two hundred kilometers per
hour.

Almost uniformly cold. Almost.

The anomaly was a region on the equator, approximately four hundred
kilometers in diameter, where the surface temperature was seventeen
degrees above the surrounding terrain. Seventeen degrees Celsius was still
bitterly cold — minus forty-six — but against a background of minus
sixty-three, it was conspicuous. It appeared on the thermal scans as a
warm spot, a faint blush of color against the blue-white monotony of the
frozen surface.

Lindqvist's first assumption was instrument error. He recalibrated the
thermal sensors and repeated the scan. The anomaly persisted.

His second assumption was geological activity — a subsurface heat source,
volcanic or geothermal, warming the surface from below. The planet's
geological profile supported this possibility: Fimbulwinter had a mass of
2.3 Earth masses, which implied a differentiated core with residual heat,
and its tidal interaction with the secondary star could maintain internal
heat generation. A geothermal anomaly in the equatorial region was
entirely plausible.

He tasked the _Tycho Brahe_'s sensor array with a detailed geological
survey of the anomaly region. The results took four hours to compile. He
reviewed them with growing interest.

The thermal anomaly was not geological.

The heat signature originated not from below the surface but from upon
it. The warm region was characterized by hundreds of discrete heat
sources, distributed in patterns that were — Lindqvist checked the
analysis three times before committing the observation to his log —
non-random.

The heat sources were arranged in clusters. The clusters were connected
by linear features that his sensors could not resolve at this distance
but that were consistent, in their geometry, with constructed pathways.
The largest clusters were positioned at the center of the warm region,
with smaller clusters distributed around them in concentric rings. The
overall pattern was regular, organized, and symmetrical.

It was, in short, consistent with a settlement.

Lindqvist set down his stylus and leaned back in his chair. Through the
observation port, the binary system hung in the blackness — the great, dim
red primary and the smaller, steadier secondary — and between them, the
four planets that had been condemned to freeze.

He had come to J2119-4 to study the death of a star. He had not expected
to find anything alive.

                              III.

The expedition committee of the _Tycho Brahe_ met at 0800 the following
morning.

The committee consisted of five people: Lindqvist, as chief science
officer; Captain Elise Froding, a Swedish Space Agency career officer
with twenty-two years of deep-space experience; Dr. Kalu Obi, a
geologist from the University of Lagos whose specialty was planetary
thermodynamics; Dr. Sarah Chen, a biologist whose presence on the
expedition had been, until this moment, largely precautionary; and
Lieutenant Commander Nils Arvidsson, the ship's executive officer and
head of operations.

Lindqvist presented his data without embellishment. He displayed the
thermal scans, the sensor analysis, the pattern distribution. He
described the anomaly's characteristics with the precision of a man
delivering a lecture to colleagues. He was, he knew, speaking too
carefully, in the way one speaks when the thing being described is so
extraordinary that any inflection of excitement or emphasis might be
mistaken for a loss of objectivity.

When he finished, the room was quiet. Captain Froding spoke first.

"You're saying there's a civilization down there."

"I am saying that the thermal data is consistent with organized,
non-random heat generation by entities that have arranged themselves in
patterns consistent with habitation. I am not prepared to use the word
'civilization' without further observation."

"But you think it is."

Lindqvist paused. "Yes," he said. "I think it is."

Dr. Obi leaned forward. "The heat sources — what are they? What's
generating the warmth?"

"I cannot determine that at this distance. The sensors can detect the
thermal signature but cannot resolve its source. It could be combustion
of organic material, geothermal tapping, nuclear processes, or something
else entirely. What I can say is that the heat is being generated
deliberately and distributed systematically. Whoever is down there is
managing their thermal resources with considerable sophistication."

"Huddled around the last warmth," Dr. Chen said quietly. She had been
staring at the thermal scan on the display, at the faint warm blush
against the frozen surface, and her expression was one that Lindqvist
recognized: the expression of a scientist confronting data that has
ceased to be data and become something that matters.

"Yes," Lindqvist said. "That is an accurate description."

"How long can they last?" Captain Froding asked.

Lindqvist had run the calculations. He had hoped someone would ask the
question, because the answer was the reason he was asking for what he was
about to ask.

"The primary star is losing luminosity at a rate of approximately 0.3
percent per century. At the current rate, the ambient temperature in the
anomaly region will drop below the survival threshold for any carbon-based
biology within approximately three hundred years. The settlement — if that
is what it is — can maintain itself as long as it can generate sufficient
heat to compensate for the declining stellar input. But the decline is
progressive and irreversible. They are fighting a battle they cannot win."

The room absorbed this.

"I want to make contact," Lindqvist said.

                              IV.

The committee's response was divided.

Dr. Chen supported contact immediately and emphatically. "If there is a
civilization on that planet, we have an obligation to document it. To
learn from it. Possibly to help it."

Dr. Obi was cautious but curious. "The scientific value is immense. But
we need to approach carefully. We know nothing about their biology, their
technology, their capacity for communication. First contact protocols
exist for a reason."

Lieutenant Commander Arvidsson raised operational concerns. "We are a
research vessel, not a contact mission. We don't have the equipment, the
training, or the authorization for first contact. If we attempt contact
and something goes wrong, we have no backup."

Captain Froding listened to all of this with the patient expression of a
woman who has made difficult decisions in deep space before and who
understands that the quality of a decision depends less on the weight of
arguments than on the clarity of the values that guide them.

"Dr. Lindqvist," she said. "You haven't stated your full position."

Lindqvist looked at her. Elise Froding had a gift for seeing through the
careful language of scientists to the conviction beneath. It was one of
the qualities that made her an effective commander, and one of the
qualities that made her, on occasion, unsettling to work with.

"My full position," Lindqvist said, "is this. There is a civilization on
that planet. It is in the process of freezing to death. The process is
slow — centuries, not years — but it is inexorable. The star that warmed
their world is dying, and nothing they can do will stop it. They are
huddled around whatever heat they can generate, and that heat will
eventually fail."

He paused. "We are four hundred astronomical units away. We have the
technology to observe them, to communicate with them, and possibly to
reach them. The question before this committee is not whether contact is
scientifically justified. The question is whether it is morally tolerable
to observe a civilization dying and do nothing."

The silence that followed was of a quality Lindqvist recognized from
faculty meetings at Uppsala when a colleague had said something that could
not be un-said.

"That's a strong position," Captain Froding said.

"Yes."

"It's also an emotional one."

"I am aware of that. I do not consider it weakened by the observation."

Arvidsson shifted in his chair. "Dr. Lindqvist, with respect — our
mission parameters are clear. We are authorized to observe and study the
J2119-4 system. We are not authorized to make contact with indigenous
life forms. That authorization must come from the Exploration Commission,
and obtaining it would require transmitting our findings to Earth and
waiting for a response. At our current distance, the round-trip
communication time is — "

"Four years, seven months," Lindqvist said. "I am aware."

"Then you understand the problem. We cannot make contact without
authorization, and we cannot obtain authorization without a four-and-a-
half-year delay. In four and a half years, our mission will be over and
we will be on our way home."

"And the civilization will still be dying."

"Yes. But that is not a problem we are equipped to solve."

Lindqvist looked at the thermal scan on the display. The warm spot. The
faint, brave blush of heat against the cold. He thought about the
individual heat sources — the discrete points of warmth that his sensors
had detected, each one representing what? A dwelling? A hearth? A fire
around which beings of unknown form gathered to share warmth in the
deepening winter of their world?

"Captain," he said. "I am requesting authorization to conduct a close
approach survey of Fimbulwinter's equatorial anomaly region. Not contact.
Observation. A detailed sensor pass at close range, to determine the
nature and extent of the settlement, the biology and technology of its
inhabitants, and any information that would facilitate future contact."

Froding considered. "That's within our mission parameters."

"Yes."

"Arvidsson?"

The executive officer frowned. "A close approach carries risk. If the
inhabitants detect us, we may trigger a response we're not prepared for.
And a close approach is, effectively, the first step toward contact,
regardless of our stated intentions."

"Noted," Froding said. "Dr. Lindqvist, I'm authorizing the close
approach survey. Observation only. No signals, no transmissions, no
attempts at communication. We observe, we document, and we transmit our
findings to the Commission with a recommendation for a dedicated contact
mission. That's what I can give you."

"Understood, Captain."

"There's one more thing," Froding said. "I know you, Soren. I've served
with you for three years, and I know that look on your face. You're not
going to be satisfied with observation."

"No," Lindqvist admitted. "I'm not."

"Then let me be clear. Observation only. If I find that you've deviated
from that restriction, I will end the survey and we will resume our
original mission profile. Are we understood?"

"We are understood."

                              V.

The _Tycho Brahe_ closed to within two astronomical units of Fimbulwinter
over the course of six days, decelerating gradually to minimize any
detectable energy signature. At this range, the ship's sensor array could
resolve the surface in detail that had been impossible at four hundred AU.

Lindqvist spent those six days at the observation console, sleeping in
three-hour intervals, eating mechanically, living inside the data.

The settlement was larger than he had initially estimated. The warm region
covered approximately six hundred square kilometers. Within it, the
sensors resolved three thousand four hundred and seventeen discrete
structures, ranging in size from small units consistent with individual
dwellings to large complexes that might be communal buildings, workshops,
or warehouses. The structures were arranged in the concentric ring pattern
he had observed earlier, with the largest structures at the center and
progressively smaller ones radiating outward.

The heat sources were clearer now. The central structures generated heat
through a process that Lindqvist's sensors characterized as controlled
nuclear fusion — small-scale, efficient, and remarkably clean. The
peripheral structures used a combination of geothermal tapping and what
appeared to be biomass combustion. The overall thermal management was
sophisticated: heat was generated centrally and distributed outward
through a network of insulated conduits, ensuring that even the
outermost structures maintained temperatures well above the ambient cold.

They were fighting the winter with everything they had.

Dr. Chen's biological analysis was more tentative, limited by the
resolution of their sensors. The inhabitants appeared to be carbon-based,
endothermic, and bipedal, with body masses roughly comparable to humans.
Their technology, insofar as it could be assessed from orbital observation,
was advanced but not spacefaring. They had nuclear fusion, geothermal
engineering, and what appeared to be a sophisticated agricultural system —
enclosed growing structures, heated and illuminated, where food was
produced in the heart of a frozen world.

"They're not dying," Chen told Lindqvist during one of their late-evening
analysis sessions. "Not yet. They've adapted. They've built a warm island
in a freezing ocean and they're sustaining it. But the ocean is rising."

"The ocean?"

"The cold. It's encroaching. I've compared the thermal data from our
first scan six days ago with today's data, and the warm zone has
contracted by approximately twelve square meters. That's consistent with
Dr. Lindqvist's projected rate of stellar luminosity decline. The heat
they're generating is holding, but the cold around them is deepening.
Every year, they have to generate a little more heat to maintain the
same temperature. Every year, the margin shrinks."

Lindqvist nodded. He had done the same calculation.

"Three hundred years," he said.

"Approximately. Give or take a century, depending on how efficiently they
can scale their heat generation. But the trend is irreversible. The star
is dying, and they can't stop it."

Lindqvist stared at the thermal display. The settlement glowed on the
screen — a warm, bright cluster of life against the vast blue-white
emptiness of the frozen planet. He thought of the word Chen had used:
an island. A warm island in a freezing ocean.

He thought of winters in Uppsala, as a boy. The long Swedish dark, the
cold that crept under doors and through window frames, the way his
mother had piled blankets on his bed and his father had fed the wood
stove in the kitchen until the cast iron glowed red. The warmth of the
house against the cold of the night. The fundamental human act of making
a warm place in a cold world and gathering the people you love inside it.

That was what they were doing. Down there, on Fimbulwinter. They were
doing what every civilization does, what every family does, what every
living thing does when the cold comes: they were gathering around the
warmth. They were holding on.

                              VI.

On December 23, ship time, Lindqvist violated his orders.

He did it at 0247 in the morning, when the ship was running on night
watch and the bridge was staffed by a single officer. He did it from the
auxiliary science station in the lower deck, which had independent access
to the communications array. He did it with the full knowledge that
Captain Froding would discover what he had done, that there would be
consequences, and that those consequences were deserved.

He transmitted a signal.

Not a message — he had no way to compose a message in a language the
inhabitants of Fimbulwinter could understand. What he transmitted was
simpler and, he hoped, more universal. A pattern. A sequence of prime
numbers — 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23 — repeated three times at a
frequency the settlement's communication systems, if they had
communication systems, might be able to detect.

A mathematical handshake. The oldest greeting in the theoretical lexicon
of interstellar contact. A way of saying: We are here. We are
intelligent. We have noticed you.

He transmitted the pattern once, then shut down the auxiliary
communications console and returned to his quarters. He did not sleep. He
sat at his desk and waited for the morning, and for whatever would come.

                              VII.

What came, first, was Captain Froding.

She appeared at his quarters at 0615, before the morning watch had
properly begun. Her expression was calm, which was worse than anger.
Anger was a reaction. Calm was a judgment already made.

"I know what you did," she said.

"I expected you would."

"The communications log flagged the unauthorized transmission at 0312.
I've been awake since then, deciding what to do about it."

"And what have you decided?"

Froding leaned against the doorframe. She looked tired. Not the tired of
a woman who has lost sleep, but the deeper tiredness of a woman who has
been forced to choose between two things she believes in.

"I've decided to wait," she said. "The signal has been sent. We can't
un-send it. If there is a response, we will deal with it. If there
isn't, then you've transmitted a series of prime numbers into the
atmosphere of a frozen planet and the only consequence is a disciplinary
mark on your record and a very difficult conversation with the Commission
when we get home."

"Elise — "

"Don't. Not yet. I need you to understand something. What you did was
wrong. Not wrong in the grand moral sense — I understand why you did it,
and I am not unsympathetic. Wrong in the professional sense. You violated
a direct order, you compromised the integrity of the mission, and you
made a unilateral decision that should have been made collectively. If I
allow that to stand without consequence, I undermine the command structure
that keeps this crew safe."

"I understand."

"Good." She paused. "Now. The signal. How long before we could expect a
response, if the inhabitants are capable of detecting and replying?"

Lindqvist calculated. "The signal would reach the surface in approximately
seventeen minutes at our current distance. If they detect it, process it,
and formulate a response, the earliest we could receive a reply would be
— " he paused, "perhaps within the hour. Assuming they have the
technology. Assuming they choose to respond."

"Then we wait," Froding said. She turned to leave, then stopped. "Soren.
For the record. If I had been in your position — a scientist, not a
commander, with no one else's safety to consider — I would have done the
same thing."

She left.

Lindqvist went to the observation console and waited.

                              VIII.

The response came at 0708.

It was not a prime number sequence. It was not a mathematical pattern of
any kind. It was simpler than that, and more extraordinary.

It was light.

From the center of the settlement on Fimbulwinter — from the largest
structure, the one that Lindqvist had hypothesized was a communal building
— a light appeared. A single, steady point of illumination, brighter than
any of the heat sources the sensors had previously detected, aimed
directly upward. Directly at the _Tycho Brahe_.

Lindqvist stared at the display. His hands were trembling. He gripped the
edge of the console to steady them.

"They see us," he whispered.

The light held steady for sixty seconds. Then it began to pulse. Not
randomly — rhythmically, in a pattern that Lindqvist's training
recognized immediately.

Prime numbers. 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23.

His own sequence, reflected back at him.

And then, after the prime sequence, something else. A new pattern. A
series of pulses that were not primes, not any mathematical sequence
Lindqvist could immediately identify. He recorded them, hands shaking,
and ran them through every pattern-recognition algorithm in the _Tycho
Brahe_'s database.

Dr. Chen, who had arrived on the observation deck without Lindqvist
noticing, looked over his shoulder at the results.

"It's not mathematics," she said.

"No."

"It's — " she studied the pulse pattern, "it's rhythmic. Regular intervals,
with variations in intensity and duration. It's almost like — "

"Music," Lindqvist said.

They stood together and watched the light from Fimbulwinter pulse against
the darkness. It pulsed in patterns that were, as Chen had intuited,
musical — rhythmic, structured, with the unmistakable quality of deliberate
composition. It was not a message in the conventional sense. It was not
information. It was expression. Art. A response to the discovery that
they were not alone in the universe, rendered not in mathematics but in
the universal language of beings who have something to say and need to
say it beautifully.

The light pulsed for seventeen minutes. Then it stopped.

Then, from the surrounding structures — from hundreds of smaller heat
sources distributed across the settlement — other lights appeared. Not
one, but many. Not in the same pattern, but in patterns that harmonized,
that complemented, that wove together like voices in a choir. The
settlement lit up, structure by structure, light by light, until the
warm zone on Fimbulwinter's equator blazed like a constellation against
the frozen dark.

Lindqvist watched. The data scrolled across his console, recording
everything — every pulse, every pattern, every harmonic. He would spend
months analyzing it. Years, perhaps. But in this moment, analysis was
not what the data required. What it required was witness.

On a world locked in the grip of an eternal winter, a civilization had
looked up at the sky and seen a sign that they were not alone. And they
had responded not with fear, not with aggression, not with the cautious
mathematical formalism that human first-contact theory had always
predicted. They had responded with song.

Captain Froding arrived on the observation deck. She stood behind
Lindqvist and watched the display. For a long time, neither of them spoke.

"Well," Froding said finally. "You've made first contact."

"They've made first contact," Lindqvist corrected quietly. "I sent
numbers. They sent music."

Froding was silent for a moment. Then: "It's December twenty-third, ship
time. Almost Christmas Eve."

"Yes."

"Tradition holds that on Christmas Eve, people gather together and sing."

"Yes."

"It seems the tradition is not unique to Earth."

Lindqvist looked at the display. The lights of Fimbulwinter were still
blazing, still pulsing, still singing in patterns that he did not yet
understand but that he recognized in a way that was deeper than
understanding. He recognized them the way you recognize the voice of
someone you have never met but have always known. The way you recognize
warmth in a cold room. The way you recognize home.

"No," he said. "It seems it is not."

He turned to Froding. "Captain, I have a recommendation."

"I thought you might."

"Transmit our findings to the Commission, as planned. Recommend a
dedicated contact mission. But include a personal addendum from me, for
the record."

"What would you like the addendum to say?"

Lindqvist looked once more at the lights — the warm, bright, defiant
lights of a civilization that had been alone in the cold for centuries
and had just learned that someone was watching, someone was listening,
someone cared.

"Tell them," he said, "that winter is not the end. Tell them that the
cold is vast and the dark is deep, but that there are warm places in it
— warm places made by beings who refuse to be cold. Tell them that on a
world at the edge of a dying star system, I found a people who sing in
the dark and light fires against the night, and that this is not merely
data to be catalogued. It is proof of something that my equations have
always implied but never stated."

"And what is that?"

"That the universe tends toward warmth. That wherever there is cold, there
will be something that builds a fire. That wherever there is darkness,
there will be something that sings."

He paused. "And tell them to hurry. The winter is long, and the fire
needs tending."

Froding nodded. "I'll transmit it tonight. Christmas Eve."

"Thank you, Captain."

"Merry Christmas, Dr. Lindqvist."

"Merry Christmas."

Through the observation port, the lights of Fimbulwinter burned on —
small, warm, and very far away, but undeniably present, undeniably bright.

A fire against the cold.

A song against the silence.

A light in the winter of worlds without end.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                GIFT OF THE MAGI, INTERSTELLAR

                      by Douglas Pemberton

================================================================================

                              I.

It is a truth universally acknowledged, at least among those who have
attempted the thing, that purchasing a Christmas gift for one's spouse across
a distance of fourteen light-years presents certain logistical difficulties
not adequately addressed by the poets.

The poets, to be fair, have had other concerns. The poets have been busy
with shepherds, mangers, and the deeper significances of frankincense. They
have not, by and large, turned their attention to the specific problem of a
man standing in a shipping office on the colony world of New Shropshire,
staring at a rate card that informs him, in the bland typography of
interstellar commerce, that a parcel weighing up to five kilograms may be
delivered to the colony world of St. Helena's Landing in approximately
thirty-one standard years, barring navigational delays, customs
complications, or the intervention of Providence.

Reginald Fothergill-Watts stared at this rate card for some time.

"Thirty-one years," he said.

"Give or take," said the clerk, a young woman of ruthlessly efficient
demeanor whose name badge identified her as P. Nguyen and whose expression
suggested that she had heard this particular objection before and had
developed a philosophical acceptance of it that bordered on the
transcendental.

"But I need it there by Christmas."

"Which Christmas?"

Reginald paused. It was, he had to admit, a reasonable question. When one's
wife resided on a world whose orbital period differed from one's own by a
factor of three, the concept of "Christmas" became a matter of some
astronomical delicacy. New Shropshire orbited its sun in four hundred and
twelve standard days, meaning that their Christmas fell, by the local
calendar, in what the inhabitants of Earth would recognize as early March.
St. Helena's Landing, on the other hand, completed its solar circuit in a
brisk one hundred and eighty-nine days, giving its colonists the dubious
privilege of celebrating Christmas roughly twice a year by the old
reckoning -- a circumstance that had, over the decades, produced a colony
of people who were either extraordinarily festive or profoundly exhausted,
depending on temperament.

"This Christmas," Reginald said, with the firmness of a man who has decided
that temporal specificity is overrated.

P. Nguyen consulted her terminal with the air of a priest consulting
scripture.

"The next available express courier to St. Helena's Landing departs on the
fourteenth. It's a fast-packet service -- military surplus, very reliable.
Transit time approximately fourteen years, eight months."

"Fourteen years."

"That's the express."

"What's the standard?"

"Standard freight to St. Helena's? Thirty-one years, as stated. The express
shaves off about half. It takes a more direct route through the Barnard
transit corridor."

Reginald performed some mental arithmetic, a practice he generally avoided
on principle, finding it undignified. The results were not encouraging.
Even the express service would deliver his gift to Margaret approximately
fifteen Christmases hence -- or, by St. Helena's reckoning, roughly
thirty Christmases hence, which was either better or worse depending on
one's perspective.

"Is there," he said, grasping at straws with the desperation of a man who
has remembered his anniversary three days late and is now compounding the
error with Christmas, "anything faster?"

P. Nguyen regarded him with the compassion one extends to small animals
who have wandered onto a busy thoroughfare.

"There is the Priority Diplomatic Service. It uses the military relay
network. Transit time of approximately four years."

"Four years! That's more like it."

"The cost is seventeen thousand credits per kilogram."

Reginald's face underwent a series of rapid transformations that a more
literary observer might have compared to weather patterns crossing a
moorland, beginning with sunshine, progressing through overcast, and
arriving at a condition best described as North Atlantic gale.

"Seventeen thousand."

"Per kilogram."

"Yes, I heard the 'per kilogram' part."

"Many people don't. I like to emphasize it."

Reginald retreated from the counter and sat down on a bench provided,
he suspected, for exactly this purpose -- a bench for men whose financial
ambitions had been recently and violently corrected. He sat there for
some time, contemplating the nature of love, distance, and compound
interest, and gradually arriving at a decision that was either very noble
or very foolish, which, as any student of human nature will confirm, are
frequently the same thing.


                              II.

The circumstances that had deposited Reginald Fothergill-Watts on New
Shropshire and his wife, Margaret, on St. Helena's Landing -- fourteen
light-years apart and receding, emotionally if not physically, at a rate
that would have alarmed a marriage counselor -- were, like most domestic
catastrophes, the result of a committee.

Specifically, the Colonial Assignment Board, Sub-Committee on Spousal
Placement, Division of Interstellar Human Resources.

When Reginald and Margaret had applied for colonial service in 2247, they
had been promised -- in writing, on official stationery, with a seal -- that
they would be assigned to the same colony. This promise, they discovered
approximately fourteen light-years too late, had been made by a sub-committee
that was subsequently dissolved, reorganized, renamed, dissolved again, and
finally reconstituted as the Advisory Panel on Workforce Distribution, which
denied any knowledge of or responsibility for promises made by its
institutional predecessors, much as a butterfly might deny responsibility
for the commitments of its caterpillar.

The result was that Reginald found himself on New Shropshire, a pleasant
if somewhat damp world devoted to agriculture and the production of a local
cheese that its inhabitants considered a delicacy and everyone else
considered an act of aggression, while Margaret was deposited on St.
Helena's Landing, a dry, warm world specializing in mineral extraction and
the cultivation of grievances against the Colonial Assignment Board.

They had been separated for three years now -- or, depending on which
calendar one consulted, four years, six years, or the better part of a
decade. The mathematics of the thing were, to use the technical term,
fiddly.

They communicated by letter. Not electronic communication -- the
interstellar relay network charged per word, and Reginald's salary as a
colonial agricultural inspector did not extend to lengthy correspondence
at point-seven credits per word. Actual physical letters, written on
actual physical paper, placed in actual physical envelopes, and consigned
to the standard freight service, which would deliver them in approximately
thirty-one years, or the express service, which would deliver them in
approximately fifteen, or the Priority Diplomatic Service, which would
deliver them in four but which cost more per gram than refined uranium.

They had settled on the express service, which meant that every letter
Reginald wrote to Margaret was, in effect, a message in a bottle cast
upon an ocean of extraordinary dimensions. He wrote faithfully once a
week, knowing that his letters would arrive in bundles, fifteen years of
correspondence tumbling through Margaret's mail slot in a single afternoon
like an avalanche of deferred affection.

It was, by any reasonable standard, an absurd way to conduct a marriage.

Reginald did not find it absurd. Reginald found it necessary.


                              III.

The gift he had selected for Margaret -- after considerable deliberation,
three consultations with his friend Hapsworth, and a glass of the local
brandy that the New Shropshire colonists produced with more enthusiasm
than skill -- was a music box.

Not just any music box. A genuine Schwannenstein mechanical music box,
handcrafted in the Swiss tradition by the only artisan in the colony
system who had mastered the technique, a elderly German immigrant on
Neue Bayern named Klaus Vetter who produced approximately four music
boxes per year and charged accordingly. This particular box played
"Greensleeves," which had been the song at their wedding, and it was
constructed from New Shropshire cedar, which smelled of the forests
that Reginald walked through every morning on his inspection rounds and
which he hoped, in a flight of romantic optimism that would have made
a poet blush, would carry something of his world to hers.

The music box weighed six hundred grams. At the Priority Diplomatic
Service rate of seventeen thousand credits per kilogram, the shipping
cost would be approximately ten thousand two hundred credits.

Reginald's monthly salary, after colonial tax, housing deduction, and
the mandatory contribution to the New Shropshire Cheese Marketing Board
(a deduction he considered especially galling), was four thousand two
hundred credits.

He began to save.

This required, first, the elimination of all non-essential expenditure,
a category that Reginald interpreted with the severity of a medieval
ascetic. The evening brandy was the first casualty. Then the weekly
dinner at the Ploughman's Rest, New Shropshire's only restaurant of any
distinction, where Reginald had been accustomed to enjoy the roast
lamb and pretend the cheese course did not exist. Then his subscription
to the Colonial Times. Then his membership in the New Shropshire
Gentleman's Social Club, where he had spent pleasant evenings playing
cards with Hapsworth, Brigadier Carstairs (ret.), and a morose
Norwegian engineer named Lundquist who cheated at whist with such
transparent enthusiasm that accusing him of it would have been cruel.

Hapsworth noticed the austerity measures and inquired.

"I am saving," Reginald said, with dignity, "for Margaret's Christmas
present."

"Ah," said Hapsworth, who was a bachelor and therefore inclined to view
the sacrifices of married life with a mixture of sympathy and relief.
"What are you getting her?"

"A music box."

"Good lord. At diplomatic shipping rates?"

"One must make certain concessions to the urgency of the thing."

"Reginald, old man, even at diplomatic rates, it won't arrive for four
years."

"Four years is better than thirty-one."

Hapsworth could not argue with this, though he tried. He was a
methodical man, Hapsworth, and he spent some time attempting to
construct an argument that fifteen years of express shipping was a
reasonable compromise between cost and sentiment, but Reginald was
immovable. When Reginald Fothergill-Watts had decided upon a course
of action, he pursued it with the placid, unstoppable determination
of a glacier, and with roughly the same regard for obstacles in his
path.

By October, he had saved enough. He returned to the shipping office.


                              IV.

Meanwhile, on St. Helena's Landing, fourteen light-years away, Margaret
Fothergill-Watts was conducting a parallel campaign of sacrifice that
would have struck an omniscient observer -- if any had been available,
which is the trouble with omniscient observers; they are never on hand
when their services would be most dramatically appreciated -- as both
touching and deeply, cosmically ironic.

Margaret was saving for a Christmas gift for Reginald.

She had settled on a pocket watch.

Not just any pocket watch. A Hauptmann chronometer, manufactured on Neue
Bayern by the same community of Swiss-German craftsmen who had
transplanted their traditions to the colony system with the determination
of people who believe that precision timekeeping is a moral imperative.
This particular chronometer was designed for agricultural use -- it
tracked not only standard time but the local solar cycle, the planting
seasons, and the tidal patterns that affected New Shropshire's coastal
farms. It was, in short, the perfect gift for a colonial agricultural
inspector, and Margaret had commissioned it six months ago, specifying
an engraving on the case that read: "All my hours are yours. -- M."

The watch weighed four hundred grams. At the Priority Diplomatic Service
rate of seventeen thousand credits per kilogram -- the rate from St.
Helena's Landing to New Shropshire being, by a bureaucratic coincidence
that surprised no one, identical -- the shipping cost would be
approximately six thousand eight hundred credits.

Margaret's salary as a mineral assay technician was slightly higher than
Reginald's, but St. Helena's Landing had a higher cost of living, and
the net effect was the same: months of austerity, sacrifice, and the
grim satisfaction of watching a savings balance creep upward like a
plant growing toward insufficient light.

She gave up her weekly visit to the Landing's only cafe. She gave up
the imported tea she had been buying at scandalous cost from a trader
who made the Barnard corridor run twice a year. She gave up her
subscription to the Colonial Geological Survey, which she read for
professional purposes but also because it was the only publication on
St. Helena's Landing that did not devote its editorial pages to
complaints about the Colonial Assignment Board.

Her friend and colleague, Dr. Priya Subramaniam, observed these
privations with concern.

"Margaret, you're not eating lunch again."

"I am economizing."

"You've been economizing for four months. You've lost weight. You've
stopped going to the cafe. You've started mending your work coveralls
instead of replacing them, which, given what we work with, is a
health hazard."

"It's for Reginald's Christmas present."

"Ah." Dr. Subramaniam, who was married to a man on the same planet and
therefore found the logistics of gift-giving comparatively trivial, sat
down with the expression of someone who has realized that the
conversation has moved into territory where logic is unwelcome. "What
are you getting him?"

"A pocket watch. A Hauptmann chronometer, with agricultural functions."

"At diplomatic shipping rates?"

"It's the only way to get it there within a reasonable timeframe."

"Margaret, four years is not a reasonable timeframe for a Christmas
present."

"It is when the alternative is thirty-one."

Dr. Subramaniam could not argue with this. Like Hapsworth on New
Shropshire, she tried; and like Hapsworth, she failed; and she
retreated with the slightly dazed expression of a person who has
encountered a force of nature disguised as a mild-mannered woman
in mended coveralls.


                              V.

On New Shropshire, Reginald brought the music box to the shipping
office, carefully wrapped in local cedar shavings and packed in a box
he had constructed himself from packing crate material, because the
official shipping containers cost extra and Reginald had calculated his
budget to the last credit with the precision of a man for whom
mathematics had become, against all prior inclination, a matter of
emotional necessity.

P. Nguyen weighed the parcel.

"Six hundred and forty grams, with packing."

"What's the cost?"

"At Priority Diplomatic rates -- ten thousand eight hundred and eighty
credits."

Reginald placed his savings card on the counter. His expression was that
of a man laying a wreath on a monument: solemn, dignified, and aware
that the gesture, however expensive, was the least he could do.

P. Nguyen processed the transaction.

"Estimated delivery: December 2251. Give or take."

"Four years."

"Roughly. There are variables -- relay station scheduling, customs
processing at the St. Helena's Landing receiving terminal, local
delivery. Could be earlier, could be later."

"But approximately Christmas 2251."

"Approximately."

Reginald nodded. It was not Christmas 2247, which was when he wanted it
to arrive. But it was Christmas, eventually, and that would have to do.

"Is there anything else?" P. Nguyen asked.

"No. That is, I think, sufficient."

He walked out of the shipping office into the damp, green-scented air
of New Shropshire and stood for a moment in the weak sunlight,
experiencing the particular blend of elation and poverty that
characterizes the aftermath of a grand romantic gesture. He was skint.
He was gloriously, magnificently, comprehensively skint. He would be
eating rice and colonial ration packs for months.

He found that he did not mind.


                              VI.

On St. Helena's Landing, three weeks later -- or, if one prefers,
three weeks earlier, the two planets' communication lag making
simultaneity a somewhat philosophical proposition -- Margaret carried the
pocket watch to the St. Helena's Landing Interstellar Shipping Terminal.

The shipping clerk, a young man whose name badge read T. Okafor and
whose manner suggested a person who had come to terms with the essential
melancholy of his profession, weighed the parcel with the gravity
appropriate to the occasion.

"Four hundred and twenty grams, packed. Priority Diplomatic Service to
New Shropshire. That's seven thousand one hundred and forty credits."

Margaret placed her savings card on the counter. T. Okafor processed the
transaction with the discretion of a man who understood that some
financial sacrifices are sacred and should not be commented upon.

"Estimated delivery: March 2252. Give or take."

"That's -- not Christmas."

"Ma'am, New Shropshire's Christmas falls in what we'd call early March.
Their orbital period --"

"Yes, I know their orbital period. My husband has explained it to me in
seven separate letters, each one more detailed than the last."

T. Okafor suppressed what might have been a smile. "Then you know that
March 2252 is approximately their Christmas."

"Four and a half years."

"Approximately."

Margaret nodded. She walked out of the terminal into the dry, warm air
of St. Helena's Landing and stood in the bright double sunlight --
Helena's Landing orbited a binary system, which made for spectacular
sunsets and complicated calendars -- and experienced the same blend
of exaltation and financial ruin that Reginald had experienced three
weeks previously, or subsequently, depending on one's relativistic
frame of reference.


                              VII.

Four years passed.

This statement, which the author has rendered in three words for the
sake of narrative economy, conceals a quantity of human experience that
would fill several volumes of considerably less frivolous fiction. Four
years on New Shropshire, during which Reginald inspected crops,
endured cheese, wrote weekly letters to a woman fourteen light-years
away, and gradually rebuilt his savings to a level that permitted the
occasional evening brandy. Four years on St. Helena's Landing, during
which Margaret analyzed mineral samples, drank inferior local tea,
wrote weekly letters to a man fourteen light-years away, and waited.

Both of them waited.

This is the part of the story that the poets would handle well, if they
could be persuaded to address it: the waiting. The specific quality of
longing that attaches to a person who has done something generous and
must now wait years to learn whether the gesture was received, appreciated,
understood. Every love story involves waiting; but most love stories have
the decency to keep the waiting period within the bounds of a single
calendar year, and preferably within the span of a long weekend.

Reginald and Margaret waited four years.

And then, on an otherwise unremarkable Tuesday in late November of 2251,
the Priority Diplomatic courier vessel _Hermes IX_ docked at St.
Helena's Landing carrying, among its cargo of classified documents,
military dispatches, and items of extraordinary value, a small wooden
box from New Shropshire that smelled faintly of cedar.


                              VIII.

Margaret opened the box on Christmas morning.

Or rather, on what passed for Christmas morning on St. Helena's Landing,
which, owing to the planet's rapid orbital period and the colonists'
determination to observe the holiday at what felt like the right
interval regardless of astronomical technicality, fell on a bright, warm
day in the middle of the local summer. Margaret had set up a small
artificial pine tree in her quarters -- real pines did not grow on St.
Helena's Landing, the soil chemistry being inhospitable to Earth
conifers -- and had placed the small wooden box beneath it the night
before, savoring the anticipation.

She opened it.

Inside, nested in cedar shavings that released a scent so powerfully
evocative of a world she had never visited but which she associated,
through years of Reginald's letters, with green hills, damp mornings,
and the particular quality of light that her husband described with a
poet's attention and a bureaucrat's vocabulary, was a music box.

She wound it.

"Greensleeves" filled the small room, delicate and precise and utterly,
devastatingly Reginald. She sat on her bed and cried, which is the
correct and time-honored response to a music box that has traveled
fourteen light-years, and then she dried her eyes and wound it again,
and listened to it three more times, and then she said, aloud, to an
empty room on a planet orbiting a binary star:

"Oh, you ridiculous, wonderful man."


                              IX.

The pocket watch arrived on New Shropshire four months later.

This was the first complication.

It arrived, to be specific, in March of 2252, which was indeed
approximately Christmas by the New Shropshire calendar, just as T.
Okafor had promised. But it did not arrive at Reginald's address.

It arrived at the Colonial Agricultural Inspectorate's central office,
because Margaret, when filling out the shipping form four and a half
years earlier, had used Reginald's work address -- the only address she
had for him, his residential address having changed twice in the
intervening years due to a housing reorganization that the Colonial
Administration had conducted with its customary blend of efficiency and
chaos.

The package sat in the Inspectorate's mail room for six weeks.

This was because the mail room was managed by a civil servant named
Horace Plunkett, a man of legendary bureaucratic precision who refused
to release any parcel without the proper form -- Form 27-B/Stroke/6,
Authorization for Receipt of Personal Items at Government Premises --
and Reginald, who did not know the package existed, had not filed such
a form.

When the package was finally discovered -- by Hapsworth, who had gone
to the mail room to collect a shipment of seed catalogs and had noticed
Reginald's name on a dusty parcel on a high shelf -- and delivered to
Reginald, who opened it with hands that trembled for reasons unrelated
to the New Shropshire climate, which was damp but not cold, he found
inside a pocket watch of extraordinary beauty.

He turned it over. On the back, engraved in letters so small and
precise that they might have been written by a very determined and very
tiny angel, were the words:

ALL MY HOURS ARE YOURS. -- M.

Reginald sat in his office for a long time, holding the watch, listening
to it tick.

Then he walked to the shipping office.


                              X.

"I need to send a letter," he said to P. Nguyen.

"Standard, express, or diplomatic?"

"Diplomatic."

P. Nguyen raised an eyebrow. A single letter, at Priority Diplomatic
rates, would cost approximately three hundred credits. But she had seen
the look on Reginald's face before -- not on his face specifically, but
on the faces of the many separated spouses, distant parents, and
homesick colonists who passed through her office -- and she processed
the transaction without comment.

The letter read:

   My dearest Margaret,

   The watch arrived. It is perfect. I carry it always.

   I must tell you something that will either make you laugh
   or cry, and knowing you, probably both: I sent you a music
   box. It should have arrived approximately four months before
   this letter reaches you.

   The music box plays "Greensleeves."

   I sold my club membership to pay for the shipping.

   I hope it arrived. I hope you wound it. I hope the cedar
   smelled the way I wanted it to -- like the forests here, like
   morning, like a world I wish you could see and which I am
   saving, in weekly letters, to describe to you until you can.

   All my hours are yours as well.

   Your devoted and only slightly impoverished husband,
   Reginald

He sealed the letter and handed it to P. Nguyen, who weighed it,
calculated the cost, and processed the shipment with the professional
composure of a woman who had, over the years, developed a complete
immunity to the emotional content of interstellar mail, and who was,
at this particular moment, entirely failing to maintain it.

"Will there be anything else?" she said, with only a very slight
thickness in her voice.

"No," said Reginald. "Thank you."

"Merry Christmas, Mr. Fothergill-Watts."

"Merry Christmas, Ms. Nguyen."


                              XI.

The letter arrived at St. Helena's Landing four years and two months
later, by which time Margaret had wound the music box approximately
one thousand five hundred times and had sent Reginald a reply -- also
by Priority Diplomatic Service, also at ruinous expense -- that read:

   My darling Reginald,

   The music box arrived on Christmas morning. I cried.
   "Greensleeves." Of course "Greensleeves." You impossible,
   sentimental, perfect man.

   But here is the thing, my love, and I need you to sit down
   before you read this, because it is going to make you laugh
   and it is going to make you cross and it is going to make
   you love the universe for its preposterous sense of humor:

   I sent you a pocket watch. A Hauptmann chronometer, with
   agricultural functions. I had it engraved. I gave up my tea
   and my cafe lunches and my geological survey subscription
   to pay for the diplomatic shipping.

   We are, it appears, still the same people we were when we
   married. Which is to say: foolish, extravagant, and
   hopelessly, idiotically in love.

   Wind the music box for me. I will wind the watch for you.
   And someday -- by God, someday -- we will be in the same
   room when the music plays and the watch ticks, and we will
   laugh about this until we cannot breathe.

   All my love across all the light-years,
   Margaret

   P.S. The cedar smelled like morning. It smelled like you.


                              XII.

Reginald received this letter in 2256, nine years after the whole
business had started. He was sitting in his office at the Inspectorate,
the Hauptmann chronometer ticking faithfully in his waistcoat pocket,
when the diplomatic courier delivered the pale blue envelope with the
St. Helena's Landing postmark.

He read it three times.

Then he laughed. He laughed for a long time, sitting in his small
office on a damp planet fourteen light-years from his wife, holding a
letter that was four years old and a watch that was five years old
and a love that was, by any accounting method available to colonial
bureaucracy, older than all of it and younger than any of it and not,
in any meaningful sense, diminished by distance or time or the
administrative incompetence of the Colonial Assignment Board, Sub-
Committee on Spousal Placement, Division of Interstellar Human
Resources.

He walked to the shipping office one more time.

P. Nguyen looked up. She had, over the years, come to recognize
Reginald's particular expression when he arrived to send a communication
to his wife: a blend of tenderness, financial anxiety, and the
stubborn, luminous determination of a man who has decided that the
universe's logistical challenges are not going to prevent him from
being a good husband.

"Diplomatic?" she said.

"Diplomatic."

"Letter or parcel?"

"Letter. A short one."

She weighed it. "Two hundred and sixty credits."

He paid.

The letter read:

   Margaret,

   I have put in for a transfer to St. Helena's Landing.
   It will take three years to process and four years to
   travel. But I am coming.

   I am bringing the music box.

   Wind the watch. I will be there when it strikes the hour.

   Yours, always and across everything,
   Reginald

The letter traveled fourteen light-years in four years and one month.
Margaret read it on a warm evening in December of 2260, sitting in
her quarters with the music box on the table beside her, "Greensleeves"
winding down to silence, and the double sunset of St. Helena's Landing
painting the sky in colors that no one on Earth had ever seen and that
she wished, with an ache that was also a joy, that Reginald could see.

She wound the watch.

She wound the music box.

And she waited, as she had always waited, as they had both always
waited -- patiently, absurdly, magnificently -- for the distances to
close and the hours to align and the gifts, given in love across the
impossible gulfs of space, to finally, finally come home.

They had thirty years. They had light-years. They had the whole
preposterous machinery of interstellar bureaucracy working against them.

They had each other.

It was enough. It was always going to be enough.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                         MIDNIGHT CLEAR

                       by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                              I.

The snow had been falling for three days.

Ruth Cawley stood at the window of the room she had claimed on the fourth
floor of what had been the Ambrose Hotel and watched the snow come down.
It fell straight, without wind. It covered the rubble and the burned-out
cars and the great heaps of shattered concrete where buildings had stood.
It covered everything equally. Snow does not distinguish between what was
precious and what was not.

She had been alone for eleven days.

The last person she had seen was old Mr. Novak from the camp in the
park. He had come to trade a can of peaches for two candles. He had
stood in the doorway of the hotel lobby, stamping his feet, his breath
making clouds, and he had said, "There are people singing, over by the
cathedral. Or what's left of it."

"Singing what?" Ruth had asked.

"Christmas songs. Hymns. I don't know." He shrugged. "I didn't stay. I
don't sing."

That had been eleven days ago. She had given him the candles. He had
given her the peaches. He had walked out into the gray afternoon and she
had not seen him since.

She ate the peaches that night. They were sweet. She sat on the floor of
the hotel room with a blanket around her shoulders and ate the peaches
with her fingers and the syrup ran down her chin and she did not wipe it
away because there was no one to see.

Now it was Christmas Eve. She knew this because she had been keeping
count since the day the sirens stopped. That had been September 14. She
had scratched a mark on the wall for every day since, using a nail she
had pulled from a baseboard. One hundred and two marks. December 24.

Christmas Eve, and the snow was falling, and the city was silent.


                              II.

The city had been called Portland. It sat at the place where two rivers
met, ringed by hills. Before the war, eighty thousand people had lived
there. After the war, the number was harder to fix. The bombs had not
fallen on Portland directly -- it was too small for that, too far from
anything that mattered to the people who decided where bombs should
fall. But the firestorms had come through, carried on winds that the
war itself had created, and then the fallout, drifting east from the
coast, and then the sickness, and then the hunger.

Ruth guessed there were maybe two thousand people left. Maybe fewer. They
lived in camps in the parks, in basements, in the upper floors of
buildings that still had roofs. They did not gather in large groups.
Large groups attracted attention, and attention, in those first months,
meant trouble -- from the armed men who moved through the countryside
taking what they wanted, from the militias that had formed and dissolved
and reformed, each one claiming authority that no one recognized.

Things had quieted since October. The armed men had moved on, or died,
or found somewhere to be. The militias had settled into territories.
There was a kind of order now, the rough order of exhaustion. People
were too tired to fight. They were too tired to do anything except
what needed doing: find food, find water, find fuel, stay warm.

Ruth had been a high school English teacher before the war. She was
forty-three years old. She had brown hair going gray, and strong hands,
and a face that her students had described as "serious," which she
understood to mean plain. She had lived alone since her divorce five
years ago. She had a daughter in Seattle.

She did not think about the daughter in Seattle.

She had survived because she was practical and because she was careful
and because she was, in a way she had never had occasion to discover
before the war, very good at being alone.


                              III.

On Christmas Eve, in the late afternoon, she heard the singing.

It came from a long way off. The snow absorbed sound, dampened it,
wrapped it in cotton. But singing carries. Even quiet singing carries,
in a silent city, on a still evening, when there is nothing else to
hear.

Ruth stood at the window and listened.

It was a hymn. She recognized the melody before she could make out the
words. "It Came Upon the Midnight Clear." An old hymn, older than the
country, older than the city, older than anything the war had destroyed.

She listened for a long time.

Then she put on her coat, and her boots, and her gloves, and the wool
hat she had found in a closet on the third floor, and she picked up her
pack, which held a water bottle and a knife and a flashlight and a small
bag of dried beans that constituted approximately one-quarter of her
remaining food supply, and she went downstairs, through the dark lobby
where the chandeliers hung crooked and dead, and she pushed open the
front door, which was heavy with piled snow, and she walked out into
the street.


                              IV.

The snow was knee-deep in places. In other places, where the wind had
found channels between the ruins, it was deeper. Ruth walked in the
middle of the street, where it was most even. The asphalt was cracked
and buckled beneath the snow but still roughly level.

She walked north. The singing was coming from the north, from the
direction of the old cathedral.

The city was very quiet. The snow made everything quiet. It covered the
burned facades of the stores on Congress Street, the broken windows
of the department store, the overturned bus that had been sitting at
the intersection of Congress and Elm since September. It made the
destruction look almost gentle. Almost peaceful. As if the city had
simply decided to lie down and let the snow cover it, the way a tired
person pulls a blanket up to their chin.

Ruth walked and listened. The singing grew clearer as she moved north.
Not louder -- the singers were not singing loudly. But clearer, the
notes separating from the general hush of the snow, becoming
individual, becoming human.

She crossed Monument Square. The statue in the center was still
standing. She could not see what it was a statue of -- the snow had
built up on it, transforming it into a white, shapeless column. She
walked past it.

On the north side of the square, she saw footprints.

Many footprints. Going in the same direction she was going. Some were
fresh. Some were partly filled with new snow. People had been walking
this way. People had been walking this way for some time.

Ruth followed the footprints.


                              V.

The Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception stood at the top of
Cumberland Avenue, on a slight rise that had once made it visible from
most of the city. It was a stone building, built in 1866, and stone
had survived better than wood or steel. The front wall still stood.
The great rose window was gone -- blown in by the pressure wave that
had knocked flat everything for a mile in every direction when the
firestorm came through -- but the arch that had held it remained,
open now to the sky, a stone frame around a rectangle of falling
snow.

The roof was mostly gone. The nave was open to the weather. Snow had
piled up between the pews, which were tumbled and broken and pushed
to the sides by the blast. The stone floor was cracked but intact.

And in the space where the nave had been, in the open air under the
falling snow, people were gathered.

Ruth stopped at the entrance and looked.

There were perhaps sixty people. Maybe seventy. They stood in a rough
semicircle facing what had been the altar, which was a pile of rubble
now, stones from the collapsed apse mixed with fragments of carved
wood and plaster. Someone had cleared a space in front of the rubble
and set up a table -- a door, it looked like, laid across two
sawhorses. On the table were candles. A dozen candles, maybe more,
burning in the snow, their flames small and steady in the windless air.

The people were singing.

They were singing "It Came Upon the Midnight Clear," and they were
singing it simply, without accompaniment, without harmony, just the
melody, plain and straight, the way you sing when you are not
performing but remembering.

Ruth stood and listened.

She recognized some of the faces. Mrs. Halliday from the camp in
Deering Oaks, who had been a nurse at Maine Medical before the war
and who still carried her nurse's bag everywhere she went, though
the supplies in it had run out weeks ago. Tom Brennan, who had been
a plumber, who had organized the water collection system that kept
the Deering Oaks camp alive. The Pelletier family -- mother, father,
two children -- who had walked in from Westbrook in October, carrying
everything they owned in garbage bags. Mr. Novak, standing in the
back, not singing, his arms folded, his face unreadable.

And others she did not recognize. People from other parts of the
city, from other camps, from the scattered, isolated pockets of
survival that dotted the ruins. People she had not known existed.

They sang.

   It came upon the midnight clear,
   That glorious song of old,
   From angels bending near the earth,
   To touch their harps of gold:
   "Peace on the earth, goodwill to men,
   From Heaven's all-gracious King."
   The world in solemn stillness lay,
   To hear the angels sing.

The snow fell on them as they sang. It settled on their shoulders and
their hats and their scarves. It did not matter. They sang.


                              VI.

A man was standing at the front, near the candles. He was not singing
either. He was watching the singers with an expression that Ruth could
not read at first -- and then she could. It was gratitude. Plain,
uncomplicated gratitude.

He was young, maybe thirty. He wore a heavy coat and a watch cap and
he had a beard that looked like it had started as neglect and become
a decision. When the hymn ended, he stepped forward.

"Thank you," he said. His voice carried in the still air. "Thank you
for coming. I know it's cold. I know it's far, for some of you. I
know that coming out at all takes a kind of courage that I'm not sure
I could explain to anyone who hasn't lived through what we've lived
through."

He paused.

"My name is Daniel Voss. Some of you know me. Before the war, I was
a music teacher at Lincoln Middle School. Sixth-grade chorus. The
Christmas concert was my favorite part of the year. Every year, I had
forty kids up on the stage in the cafeteria, singing 'Jingle Bells'
and 'Silent Night,' and their parents would sit in those little
folding chairs and cry, and I would stand in the wings and cry, and
it was the best night of the year."

A small, ragged laugh moved through the group.

"I've been thinking a lot about why we do this. Why we sing at
Christmas. And I think it's because singing is the one thing you
can't do alone. I mean, you can. You can sing alone. But it's not
the same. Singing is something you do together. It's the sound of
people being together."

He looked at the sky. Snow fell on his upturned face.

"We've lost a lot. I'm not going to list what we've lost, because
you know. You all know. And I'm not going to pretend that singing
is going to fix any of it. It won't bring back the power. It won't
bring back the people. It won't make the spring come faster or the
food last longer."

He lowered his eyes.

"But it's Christmas Eve. And we're here. And we're alive. And that's
something worth singing about."

He turned to the group and raised his hands, the way a conductor
does. Not dramatically. Gently. The way you lift something fragile.

"'Silent Night,'" he said. "Everybody knows it. Don't worry about
the key. Don't worry about getting it right. Just sing."

They sang.


                              VII.

Ruth did not sing. Not at first.

She stood at the back, near the broken doorway, and she listened, and
she watched, and she felt the thing she had not felt in one hundred
and two days.

She felt less alone.

It was not a dramatic feeling. It was not joy. It was not hope, exactly,
though it was in the neighborhood of hope, the way a suburb is in the
neighborhood of a city -- close enough to see the lights, far enough
to maintain some distance. It was the feeling of being in the presence
of other people who were alive and who had chosen, on this particular
evening, to stand in the snow and the cold and the ruin and do
something that served no practical purpose whatsoever.

They were not finding food. They were not collecting water. They were
not building shelters or repairing walls or any of the hundred urgent
tasks that survival demanded. They were singing. They were burning
candles they could not afford to burn. They were standing in the cold
when they could have been conserving warmth.

They were, Ruth understood, doing the one thing that made them
different from the animals they had been forced to become in the months
since the war. They were doing something useless and beautiful.

She sang.

She joined in on the second verse, softly, her voice rough from disuse.
She had not sung since before the war. She had not been a singer even
then -- she had been one of those people who mouthed the words at
church, self-conscious, afraid of being heard. But here, in the open
air, with the snow falling and the candles burning and sixty other
voices carrying the melody, her voice was small enough to hide in and
strong enough to matter.

   Silent night, holy night,
   All is calm, all is bright.

She sang, and the snow fell, and the candles burned, and for a few
minutes the ruined cathedral was not a ruin but a church again, doing
what churches have always done, which is to give people a place to
stand together in the dark and make a sound.


                              VIII.

After "Silent Night," they sang "O Come, All Ye Faithful." Then "Hark!
The Herald Angels Sing." Then "Away in a Manger," which the Pelletier
children knew by heart and sang with the piercing clarity of children
who do not yet understand that the world they are growing up in is not
the world that was supposed to happen.

Between songs, people talked. Not loudly. Not in the boisterous way
of the old Christmas gatherings, the parties and the dinners and the
crowded living rooms. Quietly. In the low voices of people who have
learned that speaking softly is a form of respect for the silence that
surrounds them.

Ruth stood near Mrs. Halliday, who told her about the camp in Deering
Oaks. Forty-three people now. They had dug a well. They had a
greenhouse, makeshift, built from salvaged window glass and two-by-
fours. They were growing turnips and kale. The kale was doing well.
The turnips were struggling.

"We lost the Carmichael boy last week," Mrs. Halliday said. Her voice
was steady. "Pneumonia. He was eight."

Ruth said nothing. There was nothing to say. She stood beside Mrs.
Halliday and they did not speak and that was enough.

Tom Brennan told her about the water system. They had found a spring
in the park, near the old duck pond. They had run pipes -- actual
copper pipes, salvaged from the basements of ruined houses -- from the
spring to the camp. The water was clean. It was cold and clean and
it ran year-round. Brennan spoke about the water the way a man in the
old world might have spoken about a promotion or a new car. With pride.
With the satisfaction of a thing accomplished.

The Pelletier children showed Ruth a toy they had made from wire and
a wooden spool. It was a figure, roughly human, with arms that moved
when you pulled a string. The boy, who was six, demonstrated it
solemnly. The girl, who was four, watched her brother with the
uncritical admiration of a younger sibling.

"Papa made it," the boy said.

"It's wonderful," Ruth said. And it was. It was a piece of wire and a
spool and a bit of string and it was wonderful.


                              IX.

Daniel Voss found her between songs. He was carrying a tin cup of
something hot. He held it out.

"Tea," he said. "Or what passes for it. Dried mint from the Deering
Oaks greenhouse."

Ruth took the cup. The warmth of it in her hands was startling. She
had not held anything warm in days.

"Thank you for coming," he said.

"Thank you for doing this."

He shook his head. "It wasn't my idea, originally. Mrs. Halliday
suggested it. She said people needed something. She said survival
isn't enough."

"She's right."

"I know." He looked at the gathered people, at the candles, at the
snow falling through the empty window frame where the rose window
had been. "When I was teaching -- when I had my sixth-graders up on
that stage -- I used to think, this is the most important thing I do
all year. Not the lessons. Not the grades. This. Getting forty kids
to stand together and make something beautiful."

He paused.

"I didn't know how right I was."

Ruth drank the tea. It was thin and bitter and hot and it was the best
thing she had tasted since the peaches.


                              X.

At nine o'clock -- they knew it was nine because Tom Brennan had a
wind-up watch that still worked, a fact he mentioned with a frequency
that his neighbors in the Deering Oaks camp found both reassuring and
tiresome -- Daniel Voss called for a candlelight circle.

Everyone who had a candle lit it. Those who did not stood between
those who did. They formed a circle in the nave, under the open sky,
and the candle flames made a ring of light in the darkness, small and
wavering and warm.

"I want to read something," Daniel said. He pulled a folded piece of
paper from his coat pocket. "It's from the Gospel of Luke. I'm not
a religious man, particularly. But this is the Christmas story, and
it's Christmas Eve, and I think it belongs here."

He read by candlelight, holding the paper close, squinting.

"'And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field,
keeping watch over their flock by night. And, lo, the angel of the
Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone round about
them: and they were sore afraid.'"

He paused. Looked up.

"'And the angel said unto them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you
good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.'"

The snow fell. The candles burned.

"Fear not," Daniel said again, quietly, not reading now. "Fear not."

No one spoke.

The wind stirred, briefly, and the candle flames leaned and then
straightened, and the snow continued to fall, and in the silence
Ruth felt something shift inside her, some weight she had been
carrying without knowing it, and she understood that it was not
being put down but being shared. She was not lighter. The weight
was not less. But it was distributed now, spread among sixty pairs
of shoulders, and that made it bearable.


                              XI.

They sang one more hymn.

Daniel chose it carefully. He looked at the faces in the candlelight
and he said, "One more. And I want everyone to sing this one. Even
if you don't know the words, sing what you know, and hum the rest."

He started it himself, alone, his voice a plain baritone, nothing
special, the voice of a sixth-grade music teacher in a small city
in the northeast, and the song was "O Holy Night."

   O holy night, the stars are brightly shining,
   It is the night of our dear Savior's birth.

Others joined. One by one, then in clusters, then all together, the
voices rising in the cold air, rising above the ruined walls, rising
into the falling snow.

   Long lay the world in sin and error pining,
   Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.

Ruth sang. She sang with her whole voice, not hiding, not mouthing
the words, not caring how she sounded. She sang because she was
alive and because they were alive and because it was Christmas Eve
and because singing was the sound of people deciding, together, that
the world had not ended. Not yet. Not entirely.

   A thrill of hope -- the weary world rejoices,
   For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Sixty voices in a ruined church. Snow falling through the space where
the rose window had been. Candles burning in the dark.

   Fall on your knees, O hear the angel voices!
   O night divine, O night when Christ was born!

The song ended. The last note hung in the air, suspended, held aloft
by the silence and the snow and the shared understanding that what
they had just done mattered, that it mattered more than they could
articulate, that it was the most important thing any of them had done
in one hundred and two days.

No one moved. No one spoke.

The candles burned. The snow fell.

The night was holy. Not because of theology. Not because of angels
or saviors or the promise of redemption. It was holy because they had
made it holy. Because they had chosen, in the ruins of everything
they had known, to stand together and sing.


                              XII.

Afterward, people began to leave. They said quiet goodbyes. Some
shook hands. Some embraced. The Pelletier father picked up his
daughter, who had fallen asleep against a broken pew, and carried
her out into the snow. Mrs. Halliday adjusted her nurse's bag on
her shoulder and nodded to Ruth.

"Come to the camp," she said. "Tomorrow. Christmas dinner. We're
cooking one of the turnips."

"I'll bring beans," Ruth said.

"Bring yourself. That's enough."

Ruth watched them go, one by one and in small groups, their candles
winking out as they moved away into the dark streets, their
footprints writing a brief text in the snow that the night would
erase.

Daniel Voss was the last to leave, besides Ruth. He stood at the
makeshift altar, blowing out the candles one by one, collecting the
stubs in his coat pocket. Candle stubs were valuable. Everything was
valuable now.

"Will you do this again?" Ruth asked.

"Next week. And the week after that. Every week, if people come."

"They'll come."

He looked at her. "How do you know?"

"Because they came tonight. Because they walked through the snow in
the cold and the dark to stand in a ruined building and sing. People
who do that will come back."

He nodded. He blew out the last candle. The darkness was sudden and
complete.

Then Ruth's eyes adjusted, and she saw that the darkness was not
complete at all. The sky above the open nave was thick with clouds,
but the snow reflected what light there was -- starlight, maybe, or
the diffused glow of the moon behind the overcast -- and the ruined
cathedral was not dark but dim, a gray, soft, quiet space that held
the ghost of the light that had been there and the promise of the
light that would come.

"Merry Christmas, Ruth," Daniel said.

"Merry Christmas, Daniel."


                              XIII.

She walked home through the snow. The streets were empty. The
footprints of the others were already filling in, softening,
disappearing.

The snow fell.

Ruth walked south, toward the hotel, her boots leaving tracks that
would be gone by morning. She walked and she thought about the
singing and the candles and the faces in the light and the sound
of sixty voices in the cold air, and she carried that sound with
her the way you carry a coal from a fire, cupped in your hands,
guarding it against the wind, knowing it is small and knowing it
is fragile and knowing it is the most important thing you have.

The city lay under the snow, broken and still. The buildings were
dark. The streets were empty. The war had come and done what wars
do and gone away, leaving the living to reckon with what remained.

What remained was this: people singing in the ruins. Candles burning
in the snow. A nurse with an empty bag. A plumber with a spring.
A teacher with a melody. A woman walking home in the dark with
something warm inside her that she could not name and did not need
to name because she knew what it was.

It was the sound of other voices.

It was the knowledge that she was not the only one.

It was Christmas, the first Christmas of the new world, and it was
not merry and it was not bright and it was not anything that the
word "Christmas" had meant before. But it was real. It was a
beginning. It was people standing in the wreckage and choosing to
sing.

Ruth reached the hotel. She pushed open the door. She climbed the
stairs to the fourth floor, her flashlight making a small circle
of light on the steps. She went into her room and took off her coat
and her boots and sat on the bed in the dark.

She could still hear the singing. Not literally -- the cathedral
was too far away, the night too thick, the snow too deep. But she
could hear it. She would hear it for a long time.

She reached into her pack and took out the bag of dried beans. She
counted out a portion for tomorrow -- enough for the camp, for
Christmas dinner, for a meal shared with people she was beginning
to know and who were beginning to know her.

She set the beans aside and lay down and pulled the blanket up and
closed her eyes.

Outside, the snow fell on the city. It covered the streets and the
rubble and the parks and the camps and the cathedral where the
candle wax was cooling on the makeshift altar. It covered everything.
It fell and fell and fell, silent and steady, and under it the city
slept, and in the city people slept, and in their sleeping they
carried the music with them, a hymn sung in the ruins on Christmas
Eve, the first carol of the world that was coming, the world they
would build from the wreckage, slowly, together, one song at a time.

A midnight clear.

                            [THE END]

                        COMET'S TALE

                      by Phyllis Crenshaw

================================================================================

                         ATTEMPT ONE

On the evening of December 24, 2053, at approximately 7:42 PM Eastern
Standard Time, Comet Aldridge-Sato became visible to the naked eye over
the eastern seaboard of the United States, and Eleanor Marsh's daughter
died.

These two events were not related.

Eleanor would spend the next eleven years trying to make them related --
trying, that is, to establish a causal connection between the comet and
the accident, between the cosmic and the personal, between the vast
indifferent machinery of orbital mechanics and the specific, unbearable
fact of a nine-year-old girl who ran into the street to see a comet and
did not see the truck.

She would fail. The events were not related. They merely happened at
the same time, which is how the universe operates: without narrative
structure, without dramatic irony, without the courtesy of providing
a reason.

Eleanor found the lack of a reason unacceptable.

She built a time machine.

This was not, it should be noted, the act of a madwoman. Eleanor Marsh
was a physicist of considerable distinction -- tenured at Columbia,
published in the major journals, respected by her peers, invited to the
important conferences. She had been working on the theoretical
foundations of temporal displacement for a decade before the accident,
and the accident did not make her less rigorous. It made her more
focused. The difference between theoretical physics and applied physics,
she would later write in a journal she never published, is grief.

She built the machine in her laboratory at Columbia over a period of
seven years. It was not elegant. It occupied most of a basement, it
consumed enough power to illuminate a small city, and it made a sound
when activated that one graduate student described as "what you'd hear
if you put the entire twentieth century in a blender." But it worked.

On March 15, 2064, Eleanor Marsh stepped into the machine, set the
coordinates for December 24, 2053, 7:30 PM, and went back.


                         ATTEMPT ONE (CONTINUED)

She arrived in the alley behind her old apartment building on West 113th
Street at 7:31 PM on Christmas Eve, 2053. The air was cold. The sky was
clear. She could see stars -- more stars than New York usually permitted,
because there had been a partial power outage in upper Manhattan that
evening (a fact she remembered; a fact she had used, for eleven years,
to torment herself: if the lights had been on, Lucy would not have been
able to see the comet from the street; if Lucy had not been able to see
the comet, she would not have run outside; if she had not run outside --
but this way lies the particular madness of the bereaved, and we will
not follow it further than necessary).

Eleanor walked around the building to the front entrance. She walked
quickly. She had twelve minutes.

At 7:42 PM, the comet would become visible. At 7:43 PM, nine-year-old
Lucy Marsh would burst out of the apartment building in her pajamas and
winter coat, having escaped her babysitter's attention (the babysitter,
a college sophomore named Mia Chen, would carry the guilt of this for
the rest of her life, which was not fair, because it was not her fault;
Lucy was fast and determined and the door was not locked). Lucy would
run to the middle of 113th Street, which was normally a quiet street,
and look up. At 7:44 PM, a delivery truck, moving too fast for the
conditions, would round the corner from Broadway.

Eleanor had twelve minutes. Eleven now.

She entered the building. The front door was unlocked -- another fact
she had spent eleven years regretting. She climbed the stairs to the
third floor. She stood in front of apartment 3-B.

She knocked.

The door opened. Mia Chen stood there, nineteen years old, in a
Columbia sweatshirt, holding a textbook. Behind her, on the couch,
Lucy was watching television. Lucy was wearing pajamas with rockets
on them. Her winter coat was on the hook by the door.

"Can I help you?" Mia said.

Eleanor opened her mouth. She had rehearsed this. She had spent seven
years building a time machine and she had spent every one of those
years rehearsing what she would say. She would say: Keep the door
locked. She would say: Don't let the girl outside. She would say
whatever was necessary, calmly and convincingly, to ensure that at
7:43 PM, Lucy Marsh was inside the apartment and not in the street.

What she said was: "Lucy."

It came out as a whisper. Because Lucy was alive. Lucy was sitting
on the couch in her rocket pajamas, alive, watching television, her
hair in a messy ponytail, one sock on and one sock off, alive, and
Eleanor had not seen her daughter alive in eleven years and the word
came out of her like a prayer.

Lucy looked up. "Mom?"

"Your mother's not here," Mia said, confused. "She's at a department
dinner. Who are you?"

Eleanor stood in the doorway and looked at her daughter and could not
speak.

"Ma'am? Who are you? I'm going to have to ask you to --"

"Lock the door," Eleanor managed. "Please. Lock the front door of the
building. Lock this door. Don't let her go outside."

"What? Why?"

"Please. Just -- please. Keep the door locked. Don't let her go
outside."

"Ma'am, you're scaring me. I'm going to call --"

The comet appeared.

Eleanor saw it through the window behind Mia -- a streak of light in
the dark sky, bright and sudden and beautiful, and Lucy saw it too,
because Lucy had been waiting for it all week, had circled the date on
her calendar, had talked about nothing else for days --

"THE COMET!" Lucy shouted, and she was off the couch and moving and
Eleanor was in the doorway and she grabbed for Lucy but Lucy was fast,
she was always so fast, she ducked under Eleanor's arm and she was
past Mia and into the hallway and down the stairs and Eleanor ran after
her shouting "LUCY, STOP, LUCY --"

And Lucy stopped.

She stopped on the building's front steps, because the front door of
the building was locked. Someone -- the super, another tenant, some
small agent of the universe's enormous indifference -- had locked the
front door. Lucy pulled at it and it did not open and she pulled again
and it did not open and Eleanor came down the stairs and scooped her
up and held her and Lucy said, "Mom, let go, I want to see the comet,
LET GO --"

At 7:44 PM, the delivery truck rounded the corner from Broadway.

It passed the building. The street was empty. The truck passed.

Eleanor held her daughter and cried and Lucy squirmed and protested
and the comet blazed above the city and Eleanor held on and did not
let go and everything was fine. Everything was fine.

Until she felt the pull.

The machine had a recall function. A tether. You could stay in the
past for thirty minutes, no more. After thirty minutes, the temporal
displacement field collapsed and you were pulled back, whether you
wanted to be or not.

Eleanor had been in the past for twenty-nine minutes.

"Lucy," she said. "Lucy, I love you. I love you so much."

"Mom, you're being weird. Let go. I want to see the --"

The pull.

Eleanor was gone.


                         BETWEEN ATTEMPTS

She materialized in the lab at Columbia, on the floor, on her hands
and knees, and she screamed. She screamed because she had held her
daughter and then the universe had taken her daughter away again, which
is what the universe does: it gives and it takes and it does not
explain, and the screaming was the sound of a woman who understood
this and refused to accept it.

When she stopped screaming, she checked the logs.

The machine recorded temporal displacement data with exquisite
precision. It recorded the timeline she had departed from. It recorded
the timeline she had returned to. And the two timelines were --

The same.

Nothing had changed.

She checked again. She accessed every database, every news archive,
every record she could find. December 24, 2053: Lucy Eleanor Marsh,
age 9, struck by a vehicle on West 113th Street. Pronounced dead at
Columbia Presbyterian at 8:17 PM.

But she had stopped it. She had been there. The door was locked. Lucy
did not get out. The truck passed.

She sat in the lab for a long time, and then she understood. Or rather,
she formed a hypothesis, which is what physicists do when the universe
contradicts their expectations:

She had created a branch. An alternate timeline. In that timeline,
Lucy was alive. But that timeline was not her timeline. She had been
pulled back to her own timeline, the original timeline, the one in
which Lucy died, and her intervention had not changed it. It had merely
created a copy.

Somewhere, in some branch of the timestream, Lucy was alive and
wondering why her mother had appeared in the doorway crying and then
vanished.

Eleanor thought about this for a very long time.

Then she reset the machine.


                         ATTEMPT TWO

December 24, 2053, 7:15 PM. Earlier this time. More margin.

She arrived in the alley and walked to the front of the building and
entered and climbed the stairs. She had a plan this time. Not a better
plan -- she was not sure better plans existed, given the constraints --
but a different plan.

She knocked on the door of 3-B.

Mia Chen answered. Lucy was on the couch. Rocket pajamas. One sock on,
one sock off. The television was playing a cartoon about a robot reindeer.

"Hi," Eleanor said. She kept her voice steady. She did not look at Lucy.
If she looked at Lucy, she would break again, and breaking would not
save her daughter. "I'm from building management. We've had a report of
a gas leak on this floor. We need everyone to stay inside with the doors
and windows closed until we give the all-clear. Could be an hour. Maybe
more."

Mia frowned. "A gas leak? I don't smell anything."

"That's the nature of this particular type of leak. Odorless compound.
We're testing the hallway now. Very important that the door stays locked
and no one goes in or out."

"Should we evacuate?"

"No. Safest to stay inside. The gas dissipates quickly in open air but
concentrates in hallways. Stay in the apartment. Lock the door."

"Okay. Yeah, okay." Mia turned. "Lucy, sweetie, we need to stay inside
for a little while."

"But the COMET," Lucy said, with the righteous indignation of a
nine-year-old whose priorities are both clear and non-negotiable. "It's
tonight. Mom said I could watch it from the street."

"We'll watch it from the window," Mia said.

"You can't see it from the window! The building across the street is in
the way!"

Eleanor's heart seized. She had forgotten this. The angle. From the
apartment windows, the comet would be blocked by the building opposite.
You had to be in the street to see it. That was why Lucy had gone
outside. That was always why Lucy had gone outside.

"It's a very bright comet," Eleanor said, improvising, her voice
threatening to crack. "You'll be able to see it even from the window.
The light will be visible over the rooftops."

"Really?" Lucy turned to her, and Eleanor made the mistake of meeting
her daughter's eyes, and the eyes were green and huge and full of the
particular skepticism of a child who suspects she is being managed, and
Eleanor's composure buckled.

"Really," she whispered.

Lucy studied her. "You look sad," she said.

"I'm fine."

"You look like you've been crying."

"The gas. It irritates the eyes."

"You said it was odorless."

The child had a future in cross-examination, if she had a future at all,
and this thought nearly destroyed Eleanor, but she held.

"Odorless, not irritant-free. Different properties. Stay inside. Lock
the door."

She left. She went downstairs. She locked the building's front door from
the inside and removed the key from the lock and put it in her pocket.
She went outside through the basement exit and stood in the alley and
waited.

At 7:42 PM, the comet appeared. Eleanor watched it from the alley,
leaning against the cold brick wall, and it was beautiful, the most
beautiful thing she had ever seen, because somewhere above her, in
apartment 3-B, her daughter was watching it from the window, alive,
pressing her face against the glass, seeing the light of it over the
rooftops, and somewhere on 113th Street a delivery truck was passing
through empty air, and no one was dying, no one was dying, no one
was dying.

The pull came at 7:45 PM. Eleanor let it take her.


                         BETWEEN ATTEMPTS (AGAIN)

Same result. Nothing changed. Lucy was dead in the original timeline.
Somewhere, in a branching universe, a nine-year-old girl had watched a
comet from a window and gone to bed disappointed that she hadn't seen
it better but alive, alive, and that was something, and it was not
enough.

Eleanor reset the machine.


                         ATTEMPT THREE

She arrived earlier. 6:00 PM. She gave herself time.

This time, she did not go to the apartment. She went to Broadway. She
found the dispatch office of the delivery company whose truck had killed
her daughter, a small storefront operation that handled last-minute
holiday packages. She walked in.

"I need to report a road closure," she told the dispatcher, a tired man
eating a sandwich at a desk covered in route maps. "113th Street between
Broadway and Amsterdam. Water main break. City's got it blocked off."

"Since when?"

"Since about twenty minutes ago. Big mess. You'll want to reroute any
trucks away from that block."

The dispatcher picked up his radio.

Eleanor went back to 113th Street and waited. She sat on the building's
front steps, in the cold, and waited. The sky darkened. Stars appeared.

At 7:42 PM, the comet appeared.

At 7:43 PM, Lucy burst out of the building in her rocket pajamas and
winter coat and ran into the street.

No truck came.

Lucy stood in the middle of 113th Street, her face tilted up, and the
comet streaked across the sky above her, and she shouted, "IT'S SO
BEAUTIFUL!" and she was beautiful, she was the most beautiful thing in
the universe, more beautiful than the comet, more beautiful than the
stars, more beautiful than the equations that had brought Eleanor back
through time to stand on the steps and watch her daughter watch the sky.

"It is," Eleanor said, from the steps. "It really is."

Lucy didn't hear her. She was transfixed. The comet blazed.

At 7:46 PM, Lucy went back inside. Alive. The pull came at 7:50. Eleanor
let it take her, smiling.


                         BETWEEN ATTEMPTS (ONCE MORE)

Same result. Different branch. Lucy alive in a universe Eleanor could
visit but never stay in.

She sat in the lab and thought about this.

She had now created three alternate timelines in which her daughter
survived Christmas Eve 2053. Three branches of reality in which Lucy
Marsh watched the comet and went to bed and woke up on Christmas
morning and opened her presents and grew up and lived.

Three Lucys, alive.

The original Lucy was still dead.

Eleanor thought about mathematics. About branching trees. About the
fact that every time she went back, she created another universe in
which her daughter lived, and every time she returned, she came back
to the universe in which her daughter did not. She could do this a
hundred times, a thousand times, and the result would always be the
same: more Lucys, alive and growing up in parallel worlds she could
not reach, and one Lucy, the original Lucy, her Lucy, dead.

She could populate the multiverse with living daughters and it would
not bring back the one she had lost.

This should have stopped her.

It did not.


                         ATTEMPT FOUR

This time, she did not try to prevent the accident.

She arrived at 6:30 PM. She went to the apartment. She knocked. Mia
answered.

"I'm Lucy's aunt," Eleanor said. "Eleanor. Her mother's sister. I'm
in town for the holiday and I thought I'd pop by and take Lucy for ice
cream before the comet show."

"Mrs. Marsh didn't mention --"

"It's a surprise. Call her if you like."

Mia hesitated. Eleanor's younger self was at a department dinner across
campus. Mia had her phone number. If she called --

"Please don't call," Eleanor said. "It'll ruin the surprise. Her mother
and I planned this weeks ago. I'm taking Lucy to that ice cream place
on Amsterdam. Sundaes and Comets -- you know the one? They have that
special tonight, the comet sundae. We'll watch the comet from the shop
window and I'll have her back by eight-thirty."

Lucy appeared behind Mia. She was wearing the rocket pajamas. One sock
on, one sock off. She looked up at Eleanor with her green eyes.

"I don't have an aunt named Eleanor," she said.

"Sure you do, kiddo," Eleanor said, and her voice almost broke but
didn't. "We met at Thanksgiving two years ago. You were little. You
probably don't remember."

"I remember everything," Lucy said, with the devastating confidence of
a nine-year-old. "I don't have an aunt Eleanor."

"Okay," Eleanor said. She knelt down. She looked at her daughter.
"You're right. I'm not your aunt. I'm a friend of your mom's. She
asked me to take you for ice cream because she felt bad about missing
Christmas Eve with you. She wanted you to have a good time."

Lucy considered this. "What kind of ice cream?"

"Any kind you want."

"Mint chocolate chip?"

"Two scoops."

"Three."

"Done."

Mia said, "I really should call Mrs. Marsh --"

"Two scoops is fine," Lucy said. "Let me get my coat."

They walked to Amsterdam Avenue, Eleanor and Lucy, hand in hand. Lucy
talked. She talked about the comet -- did Eleanor know it only came
around every seventy-six years? She had read about it in a book from
the library. She talked about school -- Ms. Petowski was her teacher,
and Ms. Petowski had said that the comet was made of ice and dust, which
Lucy thought was amazing, that something made of ice and dust could be
so beautiful. She talked about Christmas -- she had asked for a
telescope, and she was pretty sure she was getting one, because she had
found a box in her mom's closet that was exactly the right shape.

Eleanor listened. She held her daughter's hand and listened and the
city moved around them, lit up for Christmas, the shop windows bright,
the sidewalks crowded with last-minute shoppers, and none of them knew
that the woman walking with the girl in the winter coat was a visitor
from eleven years in the future who had violated the fundamental
structure of spacetime for the privilege of buying her dead daughter
an ice cream cone.

They got ice cream. Two scoops of mint chocolate chip for Lucy. Nothing
for Eleanor. She was not hungry. She was full of something that was not
food and not hunger but was the closest thing to nourishment she had
experienced in eleven years.

They watched the comet from the shop window. It blazed across the sky
at 7:42 PM, and Lucy pressed her face against the glass and said, "Oh
wow, oh WOW," and Eleanor stood behind her and watched her watching it
and thought: this is what I built the machine for. Not to change the
past. Not to fix what cannot be fixed. But to have this. One more hour.
One more ice cream cone. One more "oh wow."

At 7:50 PM, she walked Lucy back to the apartment. Mia was relieved.
Lucy was sticky with ice cream and incandescent with excitement.

"Did you see it? Did you SEE it? Mia, it was AMAZING, it was so
BRIGHT --"

Eleanor stood in the doorway and watched her daughter climb onto the
couch and begin recounting the comet in exhaustive detail to a
babysitter who had seen it from the window and was less impressed than
Lucy felt the occasion demanded.

"Thank you," Mia said to Eleanor.

"Thank you," Eleanor said to Mia, and she meant it with a depth that
Mia could not possibly have understood.

She walked back to the alley. She leaned against the wall and waited
for the pull.

Before it came, she said, to no one: "Merry Christmas, Lucy."

The pull took her.


                         ATTEMPT FIVE

She went back to make a different change.

This time, December 24, 2053, 2:00 PM. Long before the comet. She did
not go to 113th Street. She went to a pay phone on Broadway -- they still
had pay phones in 2053, a few, holdovers from an era that was ending --
and she called the building superintendent of 245 West 113th Street.

"Mr. Petrakis? This is the fire department. We've had a report of a
faulty lock on your building's front door. The lock is not engaging
properly. We need you to replace it today with a deadbolt that can
only be opened from inside with a key. Fire code compliance. You have
until five PM."

Mr. Petrakis, a conscientious man, replaced the lock by four-thirty.

Eleanor spent the rest of the afternoon in the park across the street,
sitting on a bench in the cold, watching the building, waiting.

At 7:43 PM, she saw Lucy hit the new door. Saw her pull at it. Saw it
hold. Heard her daughter shout in frustration, muffled by glass and
steel and a deadbolt installed six hours ago by a superintendent who
would never know why the fire department had called or why the lock
mattered.

Lucy went back upstairs. She watched the comet from the window.

The truck passed through the empty street.

Eleanor sat on the bench until the pull took her. She was smiling. She
was crying. Both at once. These are not contradictory actions when
performed by a woman who has just watched her daughter fail to die.


                         ATTEMPT SIX

Same date. Same evening. This time Eleanor arrived at 7:00 PM and went
directly to the apartment and told Mia she was from the Columbia
astronomy department and did they want to watch the comet from the
university roof, which had the best view in the neighborhood? They did.
Lucy especially did. They climbed to the roof of Pupin Hall and watched
the comet from seven stories up, far above the street, far above the
truck, far above everything, and Lucy said, "This is the best Christmas
Eve EVER," and Eleanor agreed.


                         ATTEMPT SEVEN

Same date. Eleanor arrived at noon and spent the afternoon building a
snowman on 113th Street, directly in the path the truck would take.
A very large snowman. An obstruction. The truck, arriving at 7:44 PM,
slowed to navigate around the snowman, and by the time it reached the
spot where Lucy would have been, Lucy had already gone back inside,
because the comet had passed.

This one made Eleanor laugh. She built a snowman and saved her
daughter's life and that was, she thought, exactly the kind of thing
Lucy would have loved if she could have known.


                         THE PROBLEM OF SEVEN

Eleanor went back seven times in all.

Seven Christmas Eves. Seven branches of reality in which her daughter
survived December 24, 2053. Seven Lucys who would grow up, who would
open telescopes on Christmas morning, who would go to school and fall
in love and make mistakes and live, live, live.

None of them was her Lucy. All of them were.

She understood the physics well enough to know that the branches were
real. Not metaphors, not simulations, not approximations. Real,
fully actualized timelines, as real as her own, inhabited by real
people who would live real lives. In seven universes, Lucy Marsh was
alive. In seven universes, Eleanor had not lost her daughter. In
seven universes, the comet was just a comet, just a beautiful streak
of light in the Christmas Eve sky, and not the last thing a nine-year-
old girl ever saw.

But in this universe -- the first universe, the original, the one
Eleanor returned to every time -- Lucy was gone.

And here is the question that Phyllis Crenshaw, who constructed this
story like a watchmaker constructs a watch (the metaphor is apt;
Crenshaw's father was a watchmaker, and she knew that precision and
beauty are not opposites but collaborators) -- here is the question the
story has been circling, the way a comet circles a star:

Is seven enough?

Is any number enough?

If you could go back to the worst moment of your life and create a
universe in which it didn't happen -- not change your own past, not
fix your own timeline, but create a real, parallel world in which the
people you love are alive and well -- would you do it? And if you did
it once, would you do it again? And again? And how many times would
you do it before you realized that you were not saving anyone but
rather populating the multiverse with ghosts of a happiness you could
visit but never keep?


                         ATTEMPT SEVEN (CODA)

On the seventh attempt, Eleanor did not try to save Lucy.

She arrived at 7:30 PM. She went to the apartment building. She sat on
the front steps.

At 7:42 PM, the comet appeared.

At 7:43 PM, Lucy came out of the building. Rocket pajamas. Winter coat.
One sock on, one sock off (she had not stopped to put on shoes; she
never did; she was too excited).

Lucy ran to the middle of the street and looked up.

"Oh WOW," she said.

Eleanor sat on the steps and watched her daughter watch the sky. She
did not try to stop her. She did not try to save her. She had saved her
seven times. She had saved her enough.

This time, she just watched.

The comet blazed across the sky. Lucy stood in the street with her face
tilted up and her arms spread wide, as if she could catch the light,
and she was laughing, and the comet's tail streamed behind it like a
banner, like a declaration, like a story being written across the sky
in light and ice and dust.

"It's beautiful," Lucy said.

"It is," Eleanor said, from the steps. "It's so beautiful, sweetheart."

At 7:44 PM, Eleanor heard the truck. She heard it round the corner from
Broadway. She heard the engine and the tires on the cold pavement.

She closed her eyes.

When she opened them, she was in the lab.

She was on the floor. She was on her hands and knees. She was not
screaming this time. She was quiet.

She turned off the machine.

She sat in the dark laboratory for a long time, in the silence that
follows the end of a sound that has been going on for so long you
forgot it was a sound, and she thought about seven Lucys, alive in
seven universes, watching seven comets, eating seven ice cream cones,
opening seven telescopes on seven Christmas mornings, and she thought:

It is not nothing.

It is not the same as having her back. It will never be the same as
having her back. But it is not nothing. Seven Lucys, alive. Seven
Christmas Eves saved. Seven branches of the universe in which a girl
in rocket pajamas grows up and looks at the stars and does not know
that she was saved by a woman who loved her from eleven years and an
infinite number of universes away.

It is not nothing.

Eleanor stood up. She turned on the lights. She locked the laboratory
and walked upstairs and out of the building into the March night, which
was cold and clear, and she looked up, and there were stars, and among
the stars, somewhere, invisible, a comet was making its long slow
journey through the dark, carrying its tail of ice and dust and light,
and it would come back in seventy-six years, and in seven universes a
woman named Lucy Marsh would be eighty-five years old and she would
step outside and look up and remember the night she was nine, when the
sky cracked open with beauty and everything was possible and Christmas
was magic and a strange woman who looked like her mother sat on the
front steps and said, "It's so beautiful, sweetheart."

Eleanor walked home.

It was not Christmas Eve. It was a cold night in March in the only
universe that was really hers. Her daughter was gone. The comet was
gone. The machine was off.

But seven candles burned in the dark of the multiverse. Seven gifts,
given across time. Seven versions of the story in which the ending
was different, in which the comet was just a comet and Christmas was
just Christmas and a girl in rocket pajamas lived to see the morning.

Eleanor Marsh went home, and she did not build the machine again.

She left it in the basement. A monument. A music box that played
seven songs, each one a variation on the same melody: a mother's
love, which is the only force in the known universe stubborn enough
to bend time, and the only force honest enough to know that bending
time is not the same as fixing it, and the only force brave enough
to do it anyway.

Seven times.

That was enough.

That was her gift. The gift of the magi, if the magi had been a
physicist with a time machine and a broken heart: not gold, not
frankincense, not myrrh, but seven Christmas Eves, given freely,
given at great cost, given to children in other universes who would
never know the price.

The comet would come back. It always comes back. That is the nature
of comets, and of stories, and of love.

Seventy-six years. It would be back.

And in seven universes, Lucy would be waiting.

                            [THE END]

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

FATHER THOMAS AQUINO is an ordained Jesuit priest and professor of
philosophy and theology at Loyola University in Baltimore. He has been
a contributor to this magazine since issue #17 and has published fourteen
stories exploring the intersection of faith, reason, and the vast
unknown. When not teaching or writing, he tends the garden outside his
study at the Jesuit residence, where he reports that the roses are
doing well and the tomatoes are a perpetual disappointment. He considers
this an adequate metaphor for the spiritual life. "The Star of Bethlehem
Run" is his first Christmas story, though he notes, with characteristic
understatement, that all of his stories are in some sense about the same
star.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, having published in nearly every issue since our founding. A
former autoworker and technical writer from Dearborn, Michigan, he writes
every evening from eight until midnight, seven days a week, in a
converted bedroom of his modest house, producing fiction with the steady
reliability of the assembly line where he once earned his living. He is
a veteran of the European theater, a devoted husband, a quiet man who
prefers the bar at conventions to the podium, and the backbone of this
magazine. "Twelve Parsecs of Christmas" represents a departure for Cain:
a comic adventure, written with evident delight, proving that the man
contains multitudes.

ARTHUR WAINWRIGHT is a mathematics instructor at Northeastern University
in Boston and the magazine's preeminent voice on questions of artificial
intelligence, machine consciousness, and the blurred boundary between
human and mechanical minds. The son of a clockmaker and a librarian, he
has been exploring the territory of robot fiction with unmatched rigor
and philosophical depth since issue #4. He writes from five to seven
each morning before classes, with a mechanical pencil, at the same desk,
producing stories that read like mathematical proofs and land like
poems. "Nutcracker Protocol" is, in this editor's opinion, one of
the finest stories we have ever published, and its final pages will
haunt you longer than you expect.

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV is a professor of astrophysics at the California
Institute of Technology and one of the most respected voices in hard
science fiction. Born in Kharkov, Ukraine, and raised in Cleveland, he
has spent his career balancing rigorous academic research with fiction of
extraordinary scientific precision and unexpected emotional power. He
keeps a tin toy rocket on his desk -- made by his father from a sardine
can -- and tells interviewers it is where everything started. His
colleagues describe him as "a watchmaker who happened to study stars."
"Winter on Worlds Without End" is his most poetic work to date, and it
is no accident that it is also his most scientifically ambitious.

DOUGLAS PEMBERTON is a humor columnist and author residing in Woking,
Surrey, England -- the very town where H.G. Wells landed his Martians, a
geographical coincidence Pemberton considers a personal mandate. Educated
at Oxford (Balliol College), a veteran of the Royal Navy, and by his own
admission "spectacularly incompetent at everything except making people
laugh," he is the magazine's resident wit and the author of such beloved
comedies as "The Automated Valet" and "The Conquest of Marsfield." He
lives with his wife, Penelope, three dogs, two cats, a parrot that can
recite the opening of "The War of the Worlds," and a tortoise named
Doris. "Gift of the Magi, Interstellar" is his contribution to our
Christmas issue, and it is the funniest story about heartbreak this
editor has ever read.

AGNES WHITFIELD is a former high school English teacher from Salina,
Kansas, who writes at her kitchen table between farm chores and whose
fiction possesses a spare, luminous power that belies its quiet surfaces.
She grew up on a wheat farm in central Kansas during the aftermath of
the Dust Bowl, and her stories are shaped by that experience: they are
about survival, endurance, the stubborn work of rebuilding, and the
resilience of ordinary people in the face of extraordinary disaster.
She brings homemade bread to editorial meetings and speaks with a flat
prairie accent, and she is one of the finest writers working in science
fiction today. "Midnight Clear" is the quietest story in this issue and
may be the most powerful.

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW is a philosopher, logician, and time-travel specialist
from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, whose stories are architecturally
intricate, emotionally devastating, and impossible to read only once.
The daughter of a watchmaker, educated at the University of Pennsylvania
in philosophy and logic, she has been constructing temporal paradoxes of
increasing complexity and deepening humanity since her debut in issue #9.
She is a small, quick woman with curly red hair and an infectious laugh,
known at conventions for her warmth, her generosity to young writers,
and her ability to explain causal loops using table settings. "The
Comet's Tale" is her most emotionally resonant work to date, and this
editor is not ashamed to admit that it made him cry.

             SIGNALS RECEIVED: LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have been reading your magazine since issue #1 and I must tell you
that Dr. Koslov's story in the October issue ("Perihelion Reborn") is
the finest piece of hard science fiction I have encountered since
Clarke's "The Sentinel." The orbital mechanics are flawless -- I
checked -- and the emotional resonance of the final transmission
sequence is something I did not expect from a writer whose reputation
rests on technical precision. Tell Dr. Koslov that he made this old
astronomer weep, and that his calculation of the Hohmann transfer
orbit was off by point-zero-three percent, which is close enough for
fiction and a disgrace for Caltech.

Yours sincerely,
Prof. Gerald Ashworth
Melbourne, Australia

Dear Editor,

Mr. Cain's "The Long Haul" in your November issue was a rattling good
yarn and I enjoyed every page. However, I must point out that no
freighter captain in his right mind would attempt a Jupiter slingshot
maneuver with a full cargo hold, as the tidal stresses would rupture
the hull plating long before achieving the necessary velocity. I know
this because I am a merchant marine engineer and I have been thinking
about these problems for longer than Mr. Cain has been writing about
them. If he would like to correspond about the engineering details, I
would be happy to assist. I enclose a diagram.

Respectfully,
Edgar Toombs
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania

[Editor's note: The diagram is twelve pages long. We have forwarded
it to Mr. Cain, who reports that it is "the most beautiful thing I
have ever received in the mail, and I include my wife's love letters
in that comparison." -- M.S.]

---

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am writing to commend you on the increasing number of stories by
women in recent issues. Mrs. Whitfield's "The Weather After" in the
June issue was extraordinary -- I read it three times and found
something new each time -- and Miss Crenshaw's "The Grandfather
Variations" was the most structurally inventive piece of fiction I
have encountered in any genre. However, I must note that two stories
by women in a single issue, while an improvement, does not constitute
equality. I have done the mathematics: of the seventy-two stories
published in your first twelve issues, eleven have been by women.
That is fifteen percent. I trust you can do better.

With high expectations,
Miss Dorothy Kim
Boston, Massachusetts

[Editor's note: Miss Kim is correct, and we can and will do better.
Our January issue features three stories by women writers, and we are
actively soliciting more. The future, we believe, belongs to everyone,
and our fiction should reflect that. -- M.S.]

---

Dear Tales from the Future,

I am twelve years old and I want to be a scientist when I grow up. I
read Father Aquino's stories with my mother, who says they are the
only science fiction she can understand, and I read Mr. Wainwright's
stories by myself, and I think robots are the most interesting thing
in the world. My question is: if a robot can think, does it have a
soul? My Sunday school teacher says no, but Mr. Wainwright's stories
make me think maybe yes. Who is right?

Yours truly,
James Halperin (age 12)
Schenectady, New York

[Editor's note: We forwarded this letter to Mr. Wainwright, who
responded as follows: "Dear James: Your Sunday school teacher and I
are asking the same question. We simply disagree about the answer.
This is the most interesting kind of disagreement there is, and I
encourage you to keep thinking about it for the rest of your life.
The fact that you are asking it at twelve gives me great hope for the
future." -- A.W.]

---

Dear Max,

You owe me fourteen dollars and a bottle of Scotch from our bet at
the World Science Fiction Convention in Philadelphia. I said your
magazine would last six issues. You said twelve. It has been twelve
issues and you are still publishing. I am man enough to admit when I
am wrong, and I was wrong. The magazine is good. It may even be
important. Send me your address and I will mail the Scotch.

Don't let it go to your head.

Regards,
[Name withheld by editorial policy, though the author knows
who he is and accepts the Scotch with pleasure. -- M.S.]

          THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW: BOOK REVIEWS

         Conducted by Maxwell Sterling

================================================================================

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clarke
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

Clarke has done something remarkable with this novel: he has written
an alien invasion story in which the aliens are benevolent, the
invasion is peaceful, and the end of human civilization is presented
not as a tragedy but as a transcendence. The Overlords arrive in their
vast ships, put an end to war and suffering, and shepherd humanity
toward a destiny that is at once beautiful and terrible. Clarke's
prose is as clean and measured as ever, his ideas as vast as the
cosmos he describes, and the final chapters -- in which the last
human being watches the Earth's children ascend to something beyond
humanity -- achieve a grandeur that few novels in any genre have
matched. It is, in this reviewer's opinion, the finest science
fiction novel of 1953, and one of the finest of the decade. If you
read one book this year, read this one. If you read two, read it
twice.

---

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $3.00)

Sturgeon, who is incapable of writing an uninteresting sentence, has
produced a novel about a group of misfits -- an idiot, a pair of
telekinetic twins, a teleporting girl, a baby with the mind of a
computer -- who together form a composite being greater than the sum
of its parts. It is a novel about loneliness and belonging, about the
fear of being different and the hope that difference might be a gift,
and Sturgeon writes it with a lyrical intensity that is all his own.
The prose is gorgeous, the characters are vivid and strange and
heartbreaking, and the central metaphor -- that human beings achieve
their fullest expression not alone but in combination with others --
resonates with a warmth that the genre sometimes lacks. Sturgeon is
a treasure. This book proves it.

---

FAHRENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

Bradbury's dystopia, in which firemen burn books and television screens
cover entire walls, is less a prediction than a warning, delivered
with the poetic fury of a man who loves books the way other men love
breathing. Guy Montag, the fireman who begins to doubt, is an
everyman figure whose awakening Bradbury renders with his
characteristic blend of lyrical prose and visceral imagery -- the
books burning, the mechanical hound pursuing, the river carrying
Montag toward the community of book-rememberers who keep literature
alive in their memories. It is a slender, passionate, imperfect
novel -- Bradbury's plot sometimes wobbles under the weight of his
rhetoric -- but its central argument, that a civilization that
destroys its books destroys itself, has never been more urgent. Read
it. And then, in defiance of the firemen, read it again.

                      COMING ATTRACTIONS

        A Preview of Issue #13 -- January 1954

================================================================================

NEW BEGINNINGS

The calendar turns. The year is new. And in the pages of "Tales from
the Future and Beyond," new worlds await.

Our January issue takes as its theme NEW BEGINNINGS -- stories of
first steps, fresh starts, and the courage it takes to begin again.
We are pleased to announce the following contents:

"THE FIRST MORNING" by Agnes Whitfield -- A colony ship arrives at its
destination after a journey of generations, and the first colonists to
set foot on the new world must decide what kind of civilization to
build. Whitfield brings her characteristic spare power to a story about
the weight and wonder of starting from nothing.

"TABULA RASA" by Arthur Wainwright -- An artificial intelligence is
activated for the first time and must make sense of a world it has
been built to understand but has never experienced. Wainwright's most
intimate robot story yet.

"THE SECOND CREATION" by Father Thomas Aquino -- A terraforming
scientist on Mars confronts the theological implications of creating
a living world. If we build an ecosystem from scratch, who bears
responsibility for its suffering? Aquino at his most searching and
profound.

"GREEN SHOOT" by Dr. Vincent Koslov -- On a space station orbiting a
dying star, a botanist grows a single flower. The physics of stellar
decay meets the biology of hope in this luminous short work.

"RESOLUTION" by Phyllis Crenshaw -- On New Year's Eve 2099, a woman
resolves to change one thing about the past year. She has a time
machine. What could go wrong? (Everything. Everything could go wrong.
This is a Crenshaw story.)

Also featuring new work by Theodore Cain, Colonel James "Buck" Stanton,
and a debut story by a remarkable new voice we are not yet at liberty
to name but who will, we predict, be the talk of the field by spring.

Issue #13 will be available at newsstands and by subscription on
January 5, 1954. Subscription rates: $3.50 per year (12 issues),
$6.00 for two years. Write to: Subscriptions, Tales from the Future
and Beyond, 437 Madison Avenue, New York 22, New York.
