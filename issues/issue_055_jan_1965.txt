TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling & Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

The future is arriving faster than we can write about it.

This is not a complaint. It is an observation — one that fills us with
equal measures of exhilaration and unease, and that we suspect will
resonate with many of you who have been following these pages over the
past twelve years. When this magazine published its first issue in January
1953, a story about an orbiting space station could be treated as daring
speculation. Today, satellites are so numerous that they have become
furniture of the night sky, and the prospect of men walking on the moon
has moved from the realm of science fiction into the budget projections
of the United States Congress.

The acceleration is not confined to rocketry. In the time since our last
January issue, we have witnessed the first successful telecommunications
satellite relay, the discovery of quasars at the edge of the observable
universe, and the publication of research suggesting that the genetic
code itself may be subject to deliberate modification. Each of these
developments would have been a perfectly serviceable premise for a story
in our pages five years ago. Now they are items in the newspaper.

What, then, is left for us to imagine?

Everything, we would argue. More than ever. Because the acceleration of
technological change does not diminish the need for stories — it intensifies
it. The faster the world changes, the more urgently we need fiction that
asks not merely "What is possible?" but "What does it mean? What should
we do? How should we live?" These are questions that no amount of
engineering can answer, and they are the questions that the six stories in
this issue confront with uncommon intelligence and feeling.

Cassandra Voss, in only her second appearance in these pages, delivers a
story of political revolution in space that is so precisely observed, so
knowing about the mechanics of power and compromise, that it reads less
like science fiction than like a diplomatic cable from a future that has
not yet arrived. Theodore Cain, our most faithful contributor, gives us a
planetary surveyor walking the twilight zone of a tidally locked world,
and discovers there — as he so often does — the dignity and meaning in
quiet, competent work. We are proud to introduce Elaine Prescott, whose
"Scalpel and Soma" announces a startling new voice in the fiction of
cybernetics and human modification. Lucian Marsh returns with a story that
blends Irish folklore with planetary colonization to produce something
genuinely uncanny. Agnes Whitfield offers a meditation on catastrophe and
mercy that is, we believe, among her finest work. And Miriam Blackwell
closes the issue with a love story that bends time and consciousness with
characteristic grace.

Six stories. Six visions of a future that is arriving, as we say, faster
than we can write about it. We shall do our best to keep up.

Write to us. Tell us what you think. The conversation, after fifty-five
issues, shows no signs of slowing down — even if everything else is
speeding up.

Yours in accelerating times,

                         DIALECTIC OF STARS

                        by Cassandra Voss

================================================================================

                               I.

The kidnappers were polite, which Dr. Maren Solberg found more disturbing
than if they had been brutal.

They came for her at 03:40 station time, while she was reviewing the
proofs of her monograph on transitional governance models for the
University of Ceres Press. She was seated in her office at the university
— a narrow, book-cluttered room on the seventh tier of Ceres Station,
with a view of the hydroponic galleries through a window that needed
cleaning — when the door opened without a knock and three people entered.

Two of them carried sidearms. The third, a woman of perhaps thirty-five
with close-cropped hair and the bearing of someone accustomed to command,
carried nothing but a data pad and an expression of carefully managed
tension.

"Dr. Solberg," the woman said. "My name is Commander Lida Okoro. I
apologize for the intrusion and for what I am about to ask you to do."

Maren removed her reading glasses — an affectation she maintained despite
the availability of corrective surgery, because they gave her something
to do with her hands during difficult conversations — and set them on her
desk. She was fifty-three years old, small and precise in her movements,
with gray-streaked dark hair pulled back in a style that had not changed
in twenty years. She wore the shapeless cardigan that served as her
unofficial uniform and that had been the subject of gentle mockery by
three generations of graduate students.

"You might begin," Maren said, "by explaining why you have brought armed
personnel into my office at four o'clock in the morning."

"We need you to come with us," Okoro said. "Voluntarily, if possible."

"And if not possible?"

Okoro's expression did not change, but something in the set of her
shoulders communicated the answer. Maren noted the positioning of the two
armed figures — one at the door, one at the window — and performed a rapid
calculation of her options. The calculation did not take long. She had
none.

"May I bring my glasses?" she asked.

"Of course."

"And the proofs of my monograph? I have a deadline."

Okoro hesitated, then nodded. Maren placed the reading glasses in their
case, gathered the manuscript pages into a neat stack, and placed both
items in her leather satchel. She rose from her chair with the deliberate
composure of a woman who understood that panic was a luxury available only
to those without information, and that information was the one thing she
intended to acquire.

"I assume," she said, "that this concerns the situation on Thessaly."

Okoro's eyes narrowed fractionally. "What makes you say that?"

"Commander, I hold the Anderssen Chair in Political Theory at the
University of Ceres. I have spent thirty years studying the dynamics of
colonial governance, secession movements, and revolutionary statecraft.
When armed individuals arrive at my door in the middle of the night, I
do not assume they wish to discuss my publication schedule."

For the first time, something resembling a smile crossed Okoro's face.
"You are correct, Dr. Solberg. It concerns Thessaly. Will you come?"

"I will come," Maren said. "But I will want tea."


                               II.

The vessel was a fast courier, lightly armed and running dark — no
transponder, no navigation beacon, no identification of any kind. They
departed Ceres Station through a maintenance airlock and accelerated hard
on a trajectory that the navigation officer did not share with Maren and
that she did not ask about. She had been in government long enough —
eleven years at the Colonial Affairs Bureau before her academic career —
to recognize the texture of operational security when she encountered it,
and to know that asking unnecessary questions was the fastest way to be
excluded from the answers to the necessary ones.

She sat in the courier's small wardroom and drank the tea that Okoro had
promised — a surprisingly good oolong, which suggested that whoever was
funding this operation had resources beyond the usual revolutionary
budget — and waited for Okoro to tell her what she needed to know.

Okoro sat across the narrow table, her data pad before her, and spoke
with the careful precision of a briefing officer who has rehearsed the
essential points but not the transitions between them.

"Thessaly declared independence from the Terran Administrative Authority
fourteen days ago," Okoro said. "I expect you know the broad outlines."

"The broad outlines, yes. Governor Vasquez refused to implement the new
resource extraction quotas. The TAA responded by freezing Thessaly's
trade accounts. Vasquez escalated by expelling the TAA customs garrison.
The TAA declared the expulsion an act of insurrection. Vasquez — or,
more precisely, the Thessalian Popular Assembly — responded with a formal
declaration of independence." Maren sipped her tea. "I have been following
events with some interest. Thessaly's situation has certain structural
parallels to the Callistan crisis of 2847, which I wrote about
extensively."

"We know," Okoro said. "We've read your work."

"All of it?"

"Enough. Your monograph on revolutionary constitutionalism. Your paper on
the paradox of founding authority. Your analysis of the Callistan
transition."

"Then you understand my central argument."

"That revolutionary governments face an irresolvable paradox: they claim
authority on the basis of a political order that does not yet exist, and
they attempt to create that order using power that has no legitimate
source."

Maren regarded Okoro with new respect. "That is a reasonably accurate
summary. Most of my colleagues require a semester to arrive at it."

"We don't have a semester, Dr. Solberg. We have approximately six days
before the TAA fleet arrives to reimpose authority. In that time, we need
to draft a constitution for the Republic of Thessaly — a constitution
that will be credible enough to win recognition from at least three
neutral stations and robust enough to govern a population of four hundred
thousand people who have never agreed about anything in their lives."

Maren set down her tea. "You want me to help you write a constitution."

"We want you to help us write a constitution."

"In six days."

"In six days."

Maren was silent for a long moment. Outside the wardroom's small
viewport, the stars were unmoving points of cold light against the
absolute black of space. She thought about the constitutional conventions
she had studied — Philadelphia in 1787, which had taken four months;
Callisto in 2847, which had taken two years and ended in partition;
Mars in 2790, which had produced a document of such elegant simplicity
that it governed six hundred million people and had been amended only
twice in eighty years. She thought about the conditions that had made
each of those outcomes possible: the composition of the delegations, the
distribution of interests, the quality of the compromises.

"Who are the principal factions?" she asked.

Okoro activated her data pad and projected a political map of Thessaly
that glowed in the dim wardroom light. Maren studied it with the
attention of a surgeon studying a scan.

"There are five," Okoro said. "And they are not, in any meaningful sense,
allies."


                               III.

Thessaly was a mining colony — had been a mining colony for four
generations, and the fact of extraction had shaped its politics the way
water shapes stone: slowly, invisibly, and with devastating precision.

The five factions, as Okoro described them during the remaining two days
of the voyage, were these:

The Syndicalists, who controlled the mining unions and represented the
largest single bloc of workers on the colony. They wanted collective
ownership of the means of production, direct democracy in the workplace,
and the abolition of the management class. Their leader was a former
drill operator named Pavel Kosta, who had lost his left arm in a mine
collapse and who wore the empty sleeve pinned to his shoulder as a badge
of solidarity. Kosta was charismatic, profane, and impatient with
abstraction. He had read Marx but preferred to cite his own experience.

The Democrata, a coalition of merchants, small property owners, and
professional workers who wanted a representative democracy modeled on the
Terran parliamentary systems. Their leader was Yael Brenner, a lawyer
who had served in the colonial legislature and who believed that
institutions, properly designed, could channel human conflict into
productive outcomes. Brenner was precise, legalistic, and infuriating to
negotiate with, because she insisted on defining every term before
agreeing to discuss it.

The Libertarians, who represented the independent prospectors and small
mining operations in Thessaly's outer reaches. They wanted minimal
government, individual property rights, and the freedom to exploit
whatever they found in whatever manner they chose. Their leader was
Tomasz Kral, a prospector who had made and lost three fortunes and who
regarded all government as a conspiracy to steal the fruits of individual
labor. Kral was intelligent, paranoid, and carried a sidearm at all times,
including, reportedly, in the shower.

The Nativists, a smaller but vocal faction who argued that Thessaly had
developed a distinct culture over four generations and that this culture
deserved constitutional protection from both Terran interference and
immigrant dilution. Their leader was Councillor Ama Osei, who traced her
family's presence on Thessaly to the first settlement ship and who spoke
of the colony's traditions with a reverence that Maren found both
touching and strategically dangerous.

And the Technocrats, a group of engineers, scientists, and systems
administrators who argued that governance should be determined by
competence rather than ideology, and that the complex life-support
systems of a space colony required expert management rather than
democratic deliberation. Their leader was Dr. Petros Andreadis, a
systems engineer who had kept Thessaly's atmospheric processors running
for twenty years and who had earned the right, in his own estimation, to
tell everyone else how things should work.

Five factions. Five incompatible visions of political order. And six days
to forge them into a single constitutional framework.

"You begin to see the problem," Okoro said.

"I have always seen the problem," Maren replied. "It is the same problem
that every founding faces. The question is not whether the factions
disagree — disagreement is the raw material of politics. The question is
whether they share enough common ground to make compromise possible."

"And do they?"

Maren studied the political map for a long time before answering.

"They share one thing," she said at last. "They all want to survive. That
may be enough. It is certainly all we have to work with."


                               IV.

Thessaly was smaller than Maren had expected, and larger than she was
prepared for.

The colony occupied a hollowed-out asteroid in the trailing Trojan cluster
of Jupiter, a rough sphere of tunnels and chambers that had been carved
from the living rock over four generations of habitation. The population
— four hundred and twelve thousand souls, according to the most recent
census — lived in a warren of interconnected habitats that ranged from
the relatively spacious residential galleries near the core to the
cramped, poorly ventilated mining tunnels at the periphery. The air
smelled of recycled atmosphere, machine oil, and the faintly organic
tang of hydroponic agriculture. The gravity was maintained at 0.7 standard
by centrifugal systems that hummed constantly in the background, a sound
so pervasive that the colonists had ceased to notice it and that Maren
found immediately oppressive.

She was given quarters in a converted storage room near the Assembly
Hall — a cot, a desk, a terminal, and a view of a corridor wall. She
unpacked her satchel, arranged her manuscript proofs on the desk with
the precision of a woman establishing a beachhead of normalcy in hostile
territory, and went to meet the delegates.

The Assembly Hall was a natural cavern that had been squared off with
concrete and fitted with rows of metal chairs facing a raised platform.
It had the acoustics of a cathedral and the ambiance of a warehouse. When
Maren entered, accompanied by Okoro, the five faction leaders were
already present, seated at a long table on the platform with the careful
spacing of people who did not wish to be mistaken for allies.

Okoro made the introductions. Each faction leader shook Maren's hand and
offered a greeting that communicated, with varying degrees of subtlety,
the same message: I will cooperate with this process, but do not mistake
my presence for agreement.

Kosta, the Syndicalist, gripped her hand with unnecessary force and said,
"So you're the professor who's going to tell us how to run our own
revolution."

"I am here to help you articulate what you want," Maren said. "The
decisions are yours."

"Damn right they are."

Brenner, the Democrat, offered a firm handshake and a precisely worded
statement of welcome that managed to be both gracious and noncommittal.
Kral, the Libertarian, shook her hand briefly and then stepped back, his
eyes moving constantly around the room. Osei, the Nativist, clasped
Maren's hand in both of hers and said, "We are grateful, Dr. Solberg.
Thessaly's future depends on what we do in this room." And Andreadis, the
Technocrat, offered a curt nod and said, "I hope you are better at
building consensus than your predecessors. The Callistan constitution was
a catastrophe."

"The Callistan constitution," Maren said evenly, "failed because the
delegates prioritized ideological purity over functional governance. I
intend to help you avoid that error."

Andreadis raised an eyebrow. "And how do you propose to do that?"

Maren set her satchel on the table, removed a notebook and a pen — she
preferred writing by hand when working through complex problems, a habit
that mystified her students — and looked at the five faction leaders
arranged before her.

"We will begin," she said, "with what you agree on."

The silence that followed was not encouraging.


                               V.

The first day was devoted to what Maren called "the archaeology of
consensus" — the painstaking excavation of common ground from beneath the
accumulated rubble of disagreement.

It was not a productive day.

The problem, as Maren had anticipated, was not that the factions disagreed
about specific policies — that was manageable, even useful — but that they
disagreed about the fundamental premises from which policy should be
derived. Kosta wanted collective ownership because he believed that
property was theft. Brenner wanted individual rights because she believed
that property was the foundation of liberty. Kral wanted minimal
government because he believed that all collective authority was
inherently tyrannical. Osei wanted cultural protections because she
believed that identity was more important than either property or liberty.
And Andreadis wanted technocratic management because he believed that
competence was the only legitimate basis for authority.

These were not positions that could be compromised. They were axioms, and
axioms, by definition, could not be derived from anything more
fundamental. You either accepted them or you did not.

Maren had written a paper about this — "The Axiom Problem in
Revolutionary Constitutionalism" — and she had argued, with what she now
recognized as the blithe confidence of a theorist who had never been
required to apply her theories, that the solution was to identify a
"meta-axiom" — a principle so fundamental that all parties could accept
it as a starting point for negotiation.

In theory, this was elegant.

In practice, it meant spending eleven hours in a room with five people
who could not agree on the definition of the word "citizen."

Kosta wanted citizenship tied to labor. "If you work, you're a citizen.
If you don't work, you're a parasite."

Brenner wanted citizenship tied to residence. "Anyone who lives here and
obeys the law is a citizen, regardless of their occupation."

Kral wanted citizenship to be optional. "I don't need your permission to
exist. Citizenship should be a contract that individuals choose to enter
into, with clearly defined terms and an exit clause."

Osei wanted citizenship tied to heritage. "Thessaly has been our home for
four generations. That history means something. It should mean something
in the constitution."

And Andreadis wanted citizenship tied to competence. "Not everyone is
qualified to make decisions about complex systems. We should distinguish
between citizens who vote and citizens who govern."

By the end of the first day, they had not agreed on the definition of
"citizen." They had not agreed on the name of the new republic. They had
not agreed on whether the constitution should begin with a preamble or
proceed directly to articles of governance. They had agreed, after
extensive debate, on the time at which they would reconvene the following
morning, and even that agreement had required a compromise (Kosta wanted
0600, Brenner wanted 0900, they settled on 0730).

Maren returned to her quarters, sat on the edge of her cot, and stared
at the corridor wall.

In her monograph — the one she had been proofreading when Okoro's people
came for her — she had written: "The founding moment of a new political
order is characterized by a productive tension between the ideal and the
possible, between the world as the founders wish it to be and the world
as it is. The task of constitutional design is to hold these two realities
in creative equilibrium."

She had been proud of that sentence. It was well-constructed, balanced,
and precisely wrong.

The tension was not productive. It was destructive. And the equilibrium
she had described did not exist. What existed was five groups of human
beings, each convinced that their vision of the good society was the
correct one, each willing to compromise only on matters they considered
trivial, and each aware — with a keenness that increased hourly — that
the TAA fleet was approaching at a velocity that rendered philosophical
deliberation a luxury they could not afford.


                               VI.

On the second day, Maren abandoned theory.

She did not announce this abandonment, because she was experienced enough
to know that theorists who publicly renounce theory merely replace one
theory with another. But she set aside her notebook, with its carefully
prepared frameworks and procedural outlines, and she listened.

Not to the arguments. She had heard the arguments. They were, in their
essentials, the same arguments that had been made at every constitutional
convention in human history, translated into the vocabulary of space
colonization but structurally identical to the debates in Philadelphia,
in Paris, in Pretoria. She listened instead to what the arguments
concealed: the fears, the injuries, the memories that gave the
ideological positions their emotional charge.

She listened to Kosta describe, in a voice that shook with barely
controlled rage, the mine collapse that had taken his arm and killed
fourteen of his crew — a collapse caused by inadequate safety measures
that the colonial administration had refused to fund because the cost
would have reduced quarterly extraction targets.

She listened to Brenner describe, with lawyerly precision that could not
quite disguise the tremor in her voice, the day the TAA froze her
clients' accounts and she watched three businesses she had helped build
over a decade evaporate in an afternoon.

She listened to Kral describe his childhood in the outer tunnels, where
the colonial administration's services did not reach and the only law
was the one you enforced yourself, and she understood why he regarded
government not as a protector but as an intruder.

She listened to Osei describe her grandmother's stories of the first
settlement — the fear, the hunger, the desperate improvisation that had
kept four thousand people alive in a hollow rock in the emptiness of
space — and she understood why Osei regarded Thessaly's culture not as
a set of traditions but as a survival strategy.

She listened to Andreadis describe, with the controlled fury of a man
who had spent twenty years being overruled by politicians, the seventeen
occasions on which the atmospheric processing system had nearly failed
because budget decisions were made by people who did not understand the
systems they were funding.

Five people. Five injuries. Five reasons why the old order had failed.

And buried within each injury, Maren realized, was the outline of a
shared conviction: that Thessaly's people deserved better than what the
Terran Administrative Authority had given them. That the extraction of
wealth from the colony for the benefit of distant shareholders was not
merely unjust but existentially dangerous. That a political order which
treated four hundred thousand human beings as a resource to be managed
was not a political order worth preserving.

This was not a meta-axiom. It was something messier and more useful: a
shared grievance.

"Let me ask you something," Maren said, when the day's session had
dissolved into its customary stalemate. "Not about what you want the new
republic to be. About what you want it not to be."

Five faces turned toward her, wary and attentive.

"I want it to not kill people to meet a quota," Kosta said.

"I want it to not steal what people have built," Brenner said.

"I want it to not reach into places where it has no business," Kral said.

"I want it to not forget where it came from," Osei said.

"I want it to not make decisions about things it does not understand,"
Andreadis said.

Maren nodded slowly. "Then we begin there. Not with what the republic
should be, but with what it must not be. A constitution of prohibitions.
A document that defines the limits of power before it assigns the
instruments of power."

There was a silence — different from the hostile silences of the previous
day. This was the silence of five people considering an idea they had
not previously encountered.

"A bill of negatives," Brenner said, and the lawyer in her was, for the
first time, intrigued.


                               VII.

The third and fourth days were, by any conventional measure, productive.

Working from the shared grievances she had identified, Maren guided the
delegates through a process of constitutional drafting that proceeded
not from first principles but from first injuries. Each prohibition in
the emerging document was tied to a specific failure of the old order:
the right of workers to refuse unsafe conditions (Kosta's arm); the
protection of private enterprise from arbitrary state seizure (Brenner's
clients); the limitation of government authority to enumerated functions
(Kral's childhood); the recognition of Thessalian cultural heritage as a
constitutional value (Osei's grandmother); the requirement that technical
decisions be made or reviewed by qualified personnel (Andreadis's
atmospheric processors).

It was, Maren thought, an unusual document. Most constitutions began with
an affirmation — "We the people," "All human beings are born free and
equal," "The Republic is founded upon." This one began with a series of
"never agains." It was a constitution written by people who knew exactly
what they were against and were still working out what they were for.

But it was a document. And as the articles accumulated — debated,
modified, argued over, and ultimately accepted in forms that satisfied
no one completely and everyone enough — Maren began to feel the cautious
satisfaction of a craftsman watching a structure take shape.

On the afternoon of the fourth day, that satisfaction was destroyed.

Kosta and Kral had been arguing for three hours about the structure of
the legislature — Kosta wanted a unicameral workers' assembly, Kral
wanted a minimal council with strictly limited powers — when Kosta
brought his fist down on the table and said, "This is pointless. We're
not going to agree because we don't want the same things. We never have.
The only reason we're in this room together is because we all hate the
TAA more than we hate each other, and that's not enough to build a
government on."

The room went silent.

Maren waited for someone to disagree. No one did.

And in that silence, she recognized the sound of her own theory failing.

She had written, in "The Axiom Problem in Revolutionary
Constitutionalism," that shared grievance could serve as a foundation
for constitutional order — that the experience of common oppression could
generate sufficient solidarity to bridge ideological divides. She had
argued this position at conferences, in journals, in the quiet certainty
of her office on Ceres Station, surrounded by books and papers and the
comfortable illusion that understanding a problem was the same as solving
it.

Kosta was right. Shared hatred of the old order was not enough. A
constitution required something positive — some affirmative vision of the
good society — and the five factions did not share one. They had
cooperated in revolution because revolution was a negative act, the
destruction of an existing order. But construction required agreement
about what to build, and they did not agree.

Maren removed her glasses and pressed her fingers to the bridge of her
nose.

"Mr. Kosta," she said. "You are correct."


                               VIII.

That evening, Maren sat alone in her quarters and performed an exercise
she had not undertaken since graduate school: she questioned her own
premises.

The premises were these:

That a constitution must reflect a coherent political philosophy.

That the authority of a constitution derives from the consent of the
governed.

That consent requires a shared understanding of the values the
constitution embodies.

That these values must be identified through rational deliberation among
the interested parties.

She had built her career on these premises. They were the foundation of
her published work, the framework of her teaching, the architecture of
her intellectual life. They were also, she now realized, the product of a
specific historical context — the context of stable, established
democracies where the fundamental questions had been answered generations
ago and the remaining work was adjustment and refinement.

Thessaly was not a stable, established democracy. Thessaly was a rock
in space, four hundred thousand people, five incompatible philosophies,
and a fleet approaching at constant acceleration.

Maren opened her notebook and wrote: "The error is not in the theory. The
error is in the assumption that theory is sufficient."

She stared at the sentence for a long time.

Then she wrote: "A constitution does not need to be true. It needs to
work."

She set down her pen and thought about the constitutions she most
admired — not for their philosophical elegance, but for their practical
durability. The American constitution, which was a bundle of compromises
held together by deliberate ambiguity. The Martian constitution, which
succeeded not because it resolved the tensions between its founding
factions but because it created mechanisms for managing those tensions
over time. The Callistan constitution, which failed not because it was
philosophically incoherent — it was, in fact, beautifully coherent — but
because its coherence left no room for the messy, contradictory realities
of actual governance.

Coherence, Maren realized, was the enemy.

She picked up her pen and began to write — not the constitution itself,
but a new framework for the constitutional convention. One that did not
seek agreement on values but on procedures. One that did not ask "What
do we believe?" but "How will we resolve our disagreements when they
arise — as they inevitably will?"

A constitution not as a statement of shared philosophy, but as a set of
rules for living with shared disagreement.

It was, she thought, the most important idea she had ever had. It was
also the most humiliating, because it required her to admit that thirty
years of published work had been asking the wrong question.


                               IX.

On the morning of the fifth day, Maren presented her new framework to the
delegates.

"I have been approaching this problem incorrectly," she said. "I have
been trying to help you find common ground — a shared set of values from
which a constitution can be derived. This approach has failed, and it
has failed for a reason that should have been obvious to me from the
beginning: you do not share common ground. You share common space. And
that is a fundamentally different problem."

She paused to let this sink in. The five faction leaders watched her with
the attentive wariness of people who had learned, over four days of
fruitless negotiation, to distrust eloquence.

"A constitution for a people who share common ground is a statement of
identity," Maren continued. "It says: this is who we are, and these are
the principles we live by. But a constitution for a people who share
common space is something else entirely. It is a set of procedures for
managing disagreement. It does not say 'this is who we are.' It says
'this is how we will argue.'"

"That's not a constitution," Kosta said. "That's a set of house rules."

"Yes," Maren said. "That is exactly what it is. And house rules, Mr.
Kosta, are what keep a house from burning down."

Andreadis leaned forward. "You're describing a procedural constitution.
No substantive commitments, just mechanisms for decision-making."

"Not quite. The prohibitions we drafted remain — the 'never agains.'
Those represent genuine agreement. But the positive architecture of
government — the structures, the powers, the allocation of authority —
those will be designed not to embody a shared vision but to manage the
ongoing conflict between five visions."

Brenner's eyes narrowed. "Multiple power centers."

"Yes."

"Overlapping jurisdictions."

"Yes."

"Vetoes, checks, redundancies."

"Yes. Inefficiency by design. Because the alternative to institutionalized
disagreement is dictatorship or dissolution, and I believe you have
experienced enough of both."

There was a long silence.

"It's ugly," Kral said.

"It is ugly," Maren agreed. "It will be slow, frustrating, and
frequently maddening. Decisions that should take days will take weeks.
Policies that should be straightforward will be endlessly debated and
revised. And in twenty years, when the most urgent crisis facing the
Republic of Thessaly is the inefficiency of its own government, you will
have the luxury of complaining about it — which is a luxury that subject
peoples do not have."

Another silence. And then, to Maren's surprise, it was Osei who spoke
first.

"My grandmother told me that the first year on Thessaly, nothing worked
properly. The atmospheric processors failed twice. The water recyclers
were contaminated. The hydroponics bays produced food that tasted like
metal. And the colonists spent every evening arguing about how to fix
these problems. Every evening. For a year." She paused. "They survived
because they argued. Because no one person or faction was allowed to
impose a solution. Because the arguments, as maddening as they were,
produced answers that no single perspective could have generated."

She looked at Maren. "This is what you are proposing. Not agreement. But
a way of arguing that does not destroy us."

Maren nodded. "That is precisely what I am proposing."

Kosta was the last to speak. He sat with his one arm resting on the
table, the pinned sleeve of the other hanging motionless at his side,
and his expression was the expression of a man performing a calculation
whose result he did not expect to like.

"All right," he said. "Let's build your ugly house."


                               X.

The last two days were exhausting, contentious, and — against every
reasonable expectation — productive.

They built a government with five branches, each corresponding to one of
the founding factions and each possessing specific powers and specific
vetoes. The Workers' Assembly controlled labor policy and safety
regulation. The Citizens' Parliament controlled civil law and
adjudication. The Prospectors' Council controlled resource rights and
territorial claims. The Heritage Board controlled cultural preservation
and education. The Technical Directorate controlled life-support systems
and infrastructure.

No branch could act unilaterally in any domain that affected another
branch's jurisdiction. Disputes were resolved by a Constitutional Court
whose judges were appointed one from each branch and who served for
limited terms. The constitution itself could be amended only by a
supermajority of four branches, ensuring that no faction could reshape
the fundamental order without broad agreement.

It was, as Kral had said, ugly. It was redundant, cumbersome,
deliberately inefficient, and riddled with procedural complexity that
would drive future administrators to despair.

It was also, Maren believed, functional. Not optimal — no constitution
was optimal, because optimality required a coherence that was incompatible
with the diversity of human values. But functional. Capable of absorbing
disagreement without shattering. Capable of adapting over time. Capable
of governing four hundred thousand people who did not agree about the
nature of the good society but who had agreed, through exhaustion and
pragmatism and the pressure of an approaching fleet, to live together
under a common set of rules.

On the morning of the sixth day, the delegates signed the Constitution
of the Republic of Thessaly in a ceremony that was notable for its lack
of ceremony. There was no music, no flags, no speeches. Kosta signed
with his one hand and passed the pen to Brenner, who signed with a
lawyer's precise script and passed it to Kral, who signed quickly and
stepped back, and so on down the line.

Maren watched from the side of the room. She was not a signatory — the
constitution was not hers, and she had insisted on this point. She was
an advisor, a facilitator, a technician of political architecture. The
document belonged to the people who would live under it.

When the last signature was affixed, Okoro approached her.

"The fleet will arrive in eighteen hours," Okoro said. "We've transmitted
the constitution to four neutral stations and requested formal recognition.
The response from Hygeia Station is positive. The others are considering."

"One recognition is not enough."

"No. But it is a beginning."

Maren nodded. She felt, beneath the exhaustion, an emotion she had
difficulty identifying. It was not satisfaction — the constitution was too
flawed, too compromised, too much a product of desperation for
satisfaction. It was not pride — she had spent six days watching her
life's work prove inadequate and had been forced to improvise a
replacement. It was something closer to grief. The grief of a theorist
who has learned that theory is not enough.

"Dr. Solberg," Okoro said. "You should know that the fleet's commander
has offered terms. If we dissolve the Assembly and surrender the
signatories, the TAA will restore normal governance."

"And the delegates?"

"Imprisonment. Tribunals. The usual."

Maren thought about this. About Kosta, who had lost an arm. About
Brenner, who had lost her clients. About Kral, who had never trusted
anyone in his life and who had signed a document committing himself to
collective governance. About Osei, whose grandmother's stories had given
her the words for what Maren's theories could not articulate. About
Andreadis, who had kept four hundred thousand people breathing and who had
agreed — grudgingly, furiously, but genuinely — to share power with people
he believed were incompetent.

"What will the Assembly do?" she asked.

"The Assembly will refuse," Okoro said. "The constitution has been signed.
We will defend it."

"With what?"

"With what we have."

There was nothing more to say. Maren returned to her quarters, packed her
satchel, and sat on the edge of the cot. The corridor wall was blank and
gray. Somewhere in the distance, the centrifugal systems hummed their
constant, unnoticed hum.

She opened her notebook and, on the last page, wrote a single sentence:

"The theory survived contact with practice, but only by becoming
something the theorist no longer recognized."

She closed the notebook and placed it in her satchel, next to the
unfinished proofs of her monograph. She would need to revise the
monograph extensively. Assuming she survived the next eighteen hours.
Assuming the ugly, compromised, desperately pragmatic constitution she
had helped build survived its first contact with the reality of military
force.

Assuming any of this mattered.

It mattered, she decided. Not because the Republic of Thessaly would
succeed — she could not predict that, and the odds were not favorable —
but because five factions who despised each other's visions of the good
society had chosen, under the worst possible conditions, to build a house
of rules rather than a house of ideology. They had chosen, in the only
way that actually mattered, to live together.

Maren Solberg, who had spent thirty years studying political theory,
understood for the first time that politics was not the implementation
of theory. Politics was what happened when theory failed, and people
had to figure out what to do next.

She put on her reading glasses and opened her monograph to the first page.

There was a great deal of work to be done.

                              [THE END]

================================================================================

                            MERIDIAN

                         by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The planet was called Janus, and it did not rotate.

Frank Ellerby knew this in the way he knew most things: as a fact
confirmed by instruments, recorded in survey data, and verified by his
own eyes, which were good eyes, trained by twenty-three years of
planetary surveying to notice what the instruments sometimes missed.
Janus orbited its star — a cool red dwarf catalogued as LHS 1140 and
known to the survey service as "Slim" — with one face permanently turned
toward the light and the other permanently turned away. The sunward
hemisphere was a desert of cracked stone and temperatures that could melt
lead. The dark hemisphere was an ice field, still and silent and cold
beyond any human tolerance.

Between them, running from pole to pole like a seam in the planet's skin,
was the terminator: a band of twilight roughly two hundred kilometers
wide where the temperature, by some miracle of atmospheric circulation
and geothermal regulation, was bearable. Not comfortable — the wind was
constant, the light was the perpetual gray of an overcast November
afternoon, and the temperature hovered around twelve degrees Celsius with
the dogged persistence of something that had never known variation — but
bearable. Breathable. The sort of place where, if you were the sort of
person who found beauty in marginal things, you might decide to stop and
stay.

Frank Ellerby was not that sort of person. He was a surveyor, and his job
was to walk the terminator from the sixty-fifth parallel south to the
sixty-fifth parallel north, taking measurements every five hundred meters,
and to compile those measurements into a report that would tell the
Colonial Planning Board whether Janus was worth settling. He had done
this work on eleven planets, and he approached it with the steady,
unhurried competence of a man who knew his job and did not require it to
provide meaning beyond itself.

He began at the southern end of his assigned transect on the morning of
day one — though "morning" was a courtesy term on a planet where the
light never changed — and walked north.

The terrain was rough: a jumble of basalt ridges and shallow valleys
carved by wind and the slow chemistry of an atmosphere that was mostly
nitrogen with enough oxygen to breathe, if you didn't mind the thin,
metallic taste. The vegetation — and there was vegetation, which had been
the survey's first surprise — was low and dense, a scrubby groundcover
of blue-gray lichen and something that resembled moss but was, according
to the biological team's preliminary analysis, more closely related to
a fungus. It crunched underfoot with a sound like stiff paper.

Frank walked at a steady pace, stopping at the designated intervals to
plant survey markers, take soil samples, and record atmospheric readings.
His equipment was good — a surveyor's pack with instruments for
measuring gravity, radiation, soil composition, atmospheric pressure,
wind speed, and magnetic field strength — and his routine was practiced.
Stop. Unpack. Measure. Record. Repack. Walk. He could do it in his
sleep, and on some of the longer surveys, he very nearly had.

The first anomaly appeared at kilometer forty-seven.


                               II.

It was a cairn.

A small one — perhaps half a meter tall, constructed from flat stones
stacked with deliberate precision. Frank stood before it, his survey
pack heavy on his shoulders, and regarded it with the careful attention
of a man who had been expecting nothing and had found something.

He circled the cairn, examining it from all angles. The stones were local
basalt, their surfaces weathered smooth by wind. The construction was
simple but purposeful: each stone selected for size and flatness, each
placed so that its weight helped stabilize the stone below it. It was
not a natural formation. Frank had seen natural formations on a dozen
worlds, and nature was many things, but it was not precise.

He recorded the cairn's position, dimensions, and composition in his
survey log. He photographed it from four angles. Then he continued
walking north.

The second cairn appeared at kilometer sixty-three. It was taller than
the first — nearly a meter — and more complex in construction, with
smaller stones wedged between the larger ones in a pattern that might
have been decorative or might have been structural reinforcement. Beside
it, scratched into the surface of a flat rock, was a mark that Frank
could not interpret. It was not a letter in any alphabet he recognized.
It was not a pictograph. It was a curved line that intersected a straight
one at a precise angle, and it had been made with a tool, not a natural
force.

Frank stared at the mark for a long time.

Then he opened the comm channel to the survey base.

"Ellerby to Base. I've found something you'll want to know about."


                               III.

The base commander was Dr. Yuki Tanaka, a geologist by training and an
administrator by unhappy circumstance, who responded to Frank's report
with the measured skepticism of a scientist who had been disappointed
before.

"Cairns," she said, her voice flat with the compression of the long-range
comm. "You're telling me you've found cairns."

"Two so far. Plus a mark on a rock that looks intentional."

"Could be geological. Wind erosion can produce some surprising structures."

"Dr. Tanaka, I've been surveying planets for twenty-three years. I know
what wind erosion looks like. These are constructed."

A pause. Frank could hear the faint hiss of the carrier signal and,
behind it, the muffled sound of conversation at the base.

"Continue your survey," Tanaka said. "Document everything. Do not make
contact with anything. I'm sending a biological team to your position,
but they won't reach you for three days."

"Understood."

"And Ellerby? Don't get excited. The universe is full of things that look
intentional and aren't."

"Yes, ma'am."

Frank closed the comm channel and stood in the perpetual gray twilight
of Janus, the wind pressing against him with its constant, patient force,
and looked north along the terminator. The land stretched ahead of him in
a monotone of gray and blue-gray, the basalt ridges marching toward a
horizon that was neither bright nor dark but existed in a state of
permanent indecision, as though the planet itself could not choose
between day and night and had settled for something in between.

He adjusted his pack and continued walking.


                               IV.

Over the next two days, the cairns became more numerous and more complex.

At kilometer eighty, Frank found a line of six cairns arranged in a curve
that followed the contour of a ridge. At kilometer ninety-five, he found
a flat area — roughly circular, perhaps twenty meters in diameter — where
the ground had been cleared of loose stone and the surface of the
underlying basalt had been carved with the same kind of marks he had
found beside the second cairn. There were hundreds of them, covering the
cleared surface in patterns that were too regular to be random and too
unfamiliar to be interpreted.

At kilometer one hundred and twelve, he found the first structure.

It was a wall — a low wall, no more than waist-high, built from the same
flat basalt stones as the cairns but on a larger scale. It ran for
approximately thirty meters, curving slightly, and at one end it joined
a second wall at an angle. The junction was neat and deliberate, the
stones interlocked in a way that distributed the structural load evenly.

Frank had seen enough ruins on enough worlds to recognize a building
foundation when he found one. He had also seen enough ruins to know that
a single foundation did not necessarily indicate a civilization. A
civilization required pattern, repetition, complexity. A single wall
could be an anomaly.

But a wall was not what gave him pause. What gave him pause was the moss.

The blue-gray moss-like organism that covered the ground throughout the
terminator zone grew thickly on the walls. It covered the stone surfaces
in a dense mat that was clearly well-established — years old, at a
minimum, probably decades. But along the top of the wall, the moss had
been recently trimmed. Not by wind, not by any natural process that Frank
could identify. Cut. Neatly. With something sharp.

Someone was maintaining this wall.

Frank set down his pack and sat on a stone and ate a ration bar and
thought about what he was going to write in his survey log.

He was a practical man. He had not entered the survey service out of any
grand passion for exploration or discovery; he had entered it because it
was steady work that took him to places where the air was clean and the
company was minimal, both of which he valued. He was not inclined to
speculation, and he was deeply suspicious of the human tendency to find
meaning in patterns that were merely random. But he was also honest, and
his honesty required him to record what he had observed and to draw the
conclusions that the evidence supported.

The evidence supported the conclusion that something lived in the
twilight zone of Janus that was capable of construction, tool use, and
the maintenance of built structures. Whether that something was
intelligent in the way that human beings were intelligent was a question
for the biological team. Frank's job was to observe and record.

He finished his ration bar, brushed the crumbs from his jacket, and
picked up his pack.


                               V.

He saw them for the first time on the morning of day four.

He had been walking since what his chronometer called 0600, following the
terminator north through a shallow valley where the moss grew thick and
the wind, blocked by the ridges on either side, had eased to something
almost gentle. The light was the same gray it always was. The temperature
was the same twelve degrees it always was. And the landscape was the same
monotone of basalt and lichen that it had been for four days.

Then the valley widened, and Frank Ellerby stopped walking.

The settlement — he could not think of another word for it — occupied
the floor of a broad, shallow basin where three valleys converged. It
was built from the same basalt stone as the cairns and walls he had been
documenting, but on a scale that was unmistakably communal. There were
structures — dozens of them, low-walled enclosures of varying size,
connected by paths that had been cleared of loose stone and worn smooth
by the passage of many feet. There were larger structures that might have
been communal buildings, their walls higher and more carefully
constructed. There were plots of cultivated ground where the blue-gray
moss grew in neat rows, separated by narrow channels that appeared to
function as irrigation. And there were beings.

They were roughly a meter tall, bipedal, with broad, flat bodies covered
in a dense growth that Frank initially mistook for fur but that was, on
closer observation, a fine layer of the same moss-like organism that
covered the surrounding terrain. Their heads were large relative to
their bodies, with wide-set eyes that were dark and reflective, like
pools of still water. They moved with a slow, deliberate grace that
reminded Frank of nothing so much as people walking in a garden on a
Sunday afternoon.

There were perhaps two hundred of them, and they were looking at him.

Frank stood very still. His training covered this situation — the survey
service had protocols for first contact, developed over decades of
planetary exploration and refined by the accumulated experience of every
contact that had gone wrong, which was most of them. The protocols were
clear: stop, make no sudden movements, do not approach, do not attempt
communication, wait for the contact to be established by the other party
or withdraw if the situation becomes threatening.

The situation did not become threatening. The beings regarded Frank with
an attention that was calm and, he thought, curious. Several of them
moved closer, stopping at a distance of perhaps twenty meters, and
watched him with their dark, reflective eyes.

One of them — slightly taller than the others, with a pattern of lighter
moss across its chest that might have been natural variation or might
have been deliberate decoration — stepped forward and made a sound. It
was a low, resonant hum, like the lowest note of a pipe organ, and it
seemed to come not just from the being's throat but from its entire
body, as though the sound were produced by a vibration of the moss
itself.

Frank did not hum back. He stood very still and waited.

The being hummed again, a different note, slightly higher. Then it turned
and walked — slowly, with that same deliberate Sunday-afternoon grace —
back into the settlement.

Frank remained where he was for a long time, standing at the edge of the
basin in the perpetual twilight, watching the beings go about their
lives. They moved among the structures, tended the cultivated moss,
gathered in small groups and separated again. They hummed to each other
— constantly, a low murmur that blended with the wind to produce a
sound that was neither music nor speech but something in between.

He thought about the terminator zone. Two hundred kilometers wide, from
pole to pole. A strip of habitable land between two absolutes — the
killing light of the day side and the killing cold of the night side.
A margin. A place defined not by what it was but by what it was not.

These beings had built their lives in that margin. Not on the day side,
where the energy was abundant but overwhelming. Not on the night side,
where the cold was absolute and nothing could survive. But in between.
In the narrow band where the extremes were balanced. Where the light
was not too much and the dark was not too little. Where the temperature
was merely bearable, the wind was merely constant, and the landscape
was merely gray.

Frank Ellerby, who was not a philosophical man, found himself thinking
about margins. About the spaces between extremes. About the fact that
life — here, on this tidally locked rock in the orbit of a dim red
star — had found its foothold not in the places of abundance or scarcity
but in the place of moderation.

He sat down at the edge of the basin and took out his survey log and
began to write.


                               VI.

The biological team arrived on day seven, led by Dr. Sato, a xenobiologist
with the intensity of someone who has spent a career waiting for exactly
this moment and is determined not to waste it. Frank led them to the
settlement and stood back while they did their work — observation,
recording, the careful, non-invasive examination that the first-contact
protocols required.

The beings — Dr. Sato called them "meridians," after their habitat, and
the name stuck — were cooperative in the way that utterly unfrightened
creatures are cooperative. They did not approach the human team, but they
did not flee from it, either. They continued their daily routines —
tending the moss gardens, maintaining the stone structures, gathering
and separating and humming — as though the arrival of beings from another
star was an event of mild interest but not particular concern.

Dr. Sato was fascinated. Frank, who had seen scientists fascinated before
and knew that fascination in scientists led to extended timelines and
revised survey plans, resigned himself to a longer stay on Janus than he
had anticipated.

Over the following weeks, the team established a base camp at a
respectful distance from the settlement and began the slow process of
observation and tentative interaction. The meridians, it became clear,
were intelligent — not in the way that human beings were intelligent, not
with tools and language and the relentless drive to reshape the world,
but in a way that was adapted to their environment with a precision that
Frank found quietly remarkable.

They communicated through their humming — a complex tonal system that Dr.
Sato's team spent months analyzing and never fully deciphered. They
cultivated the moss-like organism not just for food but as a material
for construction, insulation, and what appeared to be a form of medicine.
Their social structure was fluid and non-hierarchical, groups forming and
dissolving based on the requirements of particular tasks. They had no
apparent religion, no art in any form that the human team could identify,
and no technology beyond stone tools and the careful management of their
biological environment.

What they had was an extraordinary sensitivity to the conditions of the
terminator zone. They could detect changes in atmospheric pressure,
temperature, and wind direction with a precision that exceeded the
team's instruments. Several times, Frank observed a meridian pause in
its work, tilt its broad head as though listening to something beyond
the range of human hearing, and then move to a different location moments
before a wind shift made the original location untenable.

They lived, Frank realized, in constant negotiation with their
environment. Every moment was an act of adjustment, a calibration of
position and activity to the endlessly shifting conditions of the
twilight band. They did not fight the wind; they moved with it. They
did not resist the cold; they positioned themselves where the geothermal
vents tempered it. They did not seek the light; they occupied the zone
where the light was sufficient and no more.

It was, Frank thought, a way of living that was entirely foreign to the
human temperament. Human beings, as a species, were drawn to extremes.
They wanted the brightest light, the greatest power, the fastest speed,
the most territory. They built civilizations in deserts and jungles and
on the peaks of mountains, driven by an impulse that was either
admirable or pathological, depending on your perspective. They did not,
as a rule, choose the margin. They did not, as a rule, seek the moderate.

The meridians had built their entire civilization — such as it was — on
the principle of sufficiency. Enough light. Enough warmth. Enough food.
Enough shelter. Not more. Not less. Enough.


                               VII.

Frank filed his survey report on day forty-two, six weeks after he had
planted the first marker at the sixty-fifth parallel south.

The report was thorough, accurate, and dispassionate — a surveyor's
report, compiled by a surveyor, for the use of the Colonial Planning
Board. It documented the terrain, the atmosphere, the geology, the
biology. It documented the cairns, the walls, the settlement, the
meridians. It included measurements, coordinates, photographs, and
atmospheric data. It was the kind of report that Frank had filed eleven
times before, and it was, in every technical sense, complete.

But at the end of the report, in the section reserved for the surveyor's
assessment and recommendation, Frank wrote something he had never written
before.

He wrote that the terminator zone of Janus was, by the standard criteria
of the Colonial Planning Board, suitable for human settlement. The
atmosphere was breathable. The temperature was within habitable range.
The terrain, while rough, was navigable. Resources were present, if
limited. A colony could be established in the twilight band, and it
would, in all probability, survive.

But a colony in the twilight band would displace the meridians. Not
through violence — human colonists would have no reason for violence
against creatures so small and so peaceable. But through the simple,
inexorable pressure of human expansion. Human beings would build larger
structures, cultivate more land, dig deeper mines. They would push the
margins of the habitable zone outward with technology, as they always
did. And as they expanded, the meridians — who could not survive in the
full light or the full dark, who had no technology to extend their range,
who lived in a state of precise and fragile equilibrium with their
environment — would retreat. And retreat. And eventually, having nowhere
left to retreat to, they would disappear.

This was not, Frank acknowledged, a certainty. It was a probability,
based on the historical pattern of human colonization and the biological
constraints of the meridians' existence. But the probability was high,
and the consequences were irreversible.

Frank Ellerby, who had never written a recommendation that deviated from
the standard assessment criteria, and who had always understood his job
to be the provision of data rather than the expression of opinions, wrote
the following:

"Recommend classification of Janus as a protected world. The terminator
zone contains an indigenous civilization that is uniquely adapted to the
specific conditions of the twilight band and that cannot, in the
surveyor's assessment, coexist with human settlement. The meridians are
not a resource to be managed. They are a people who have found a way to
live in a place where living is barely possible, and they have done so
by accepting the limitations of their environment rather than attempting
to overcome them. This surveyor is not qualified to say whether this
represents wisdom or merely adaptation. But he is qualified to say that
it should not be destroyed."

He read the paragraph over three times. It was not, by any standard, the
sort of thing a surveyor was supposed to write.

He submitted the report without changing it.


                               VIII.

The Colonial Planning Board received Frank's report, noted his
recommendation, and filed it for review. The review process, Frank knew
from experience, would take between six months and two years, during
which time the report would be read by committees, assessed by analysts,
debated by bureaucrats, and ultimately decided by people who had never
set foot on Janus and never would.

He did not know what the decision would be. The Board had, in the past,
designated planets as protected — but only rarely, and only when the
political cost of colonization outweighed the economic benefit. Janus was
rich in rare minerals. The terminator zone was the only habitable region.
The meridians had no political advocates, no strategic value, and no way
to make their case in any forum that human institutions recognized.

Frank completed his survey, packed his equipment, and boarded the
transport that would take him to his next assignment — a moon of a gas
giant in a system that the survey service had catalogued but not yet
explored. It was, by all accounts, a barren and uninteresting moon,
devoid of life and atmosphere, notable only for its deposits of heavy
metals.

He was looking forward to it.

Not because it was exciting — it was not, and Frank did not require
excitement — but because it was simple. Rocks and metal and the clear,
uncomplicated silence of an empty world. No cairns. No settlements. No
dark, reflective eyes watching him from the twilight.

No choices to make that mattered beyond the accuracy of his measurements.

As the transport rose through Janus's thin atmosphere, Frank looked down
at the terminator zone. From altitude, it was clearly visible: a narrow
band of gray between the blinding white of the day side and the absolute
black of the night side. A margin. A seam. A place that existed only
because two extremes had failed to meet.

Somewhere in that margin, the meridians were going about their lives.
Tending their moss gardens, maintaining their stone walls, humming to
each other in their low, resonant voices. Living in the space between
too much and too little. Getting by.

Frank Ellerby, surveyor, watched the terminator shrink to a line, then
to a thread, then to nothing as the planet fell away beneath him.

He opened his log and began preparing for the next survey.

                               I.

The patient's name was Gerald Fenn, and he wanted to be diminished.

Dr. Nora Calder read his intake form twice, then set it face-down on her
desk. The form was thorough — Fenn had been referred through the standard
channels, screened by two consulting psychiatrists, and cleared for
preliminary evaluation — but the request it described was unlike anything
she had encountered in eleven years of practice at the Lowell Institute
for Cognitive Surgery.

The Lowell Institute occupied three floors of a converted textile mill
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a building whose red-brick solidity and
exposed ceiling beams gave it the feel of a place where things were
made rather than imagined. This was deliberate. Dr. Armond Lowell, who
had founded the institute in 2031 and who remained its director at the
age of seventy-four, believed that the practice of neural modification
should feel as grounded and unglamorous as possible. "We are plumbers of
the brain," he told new residents. "We fix pipes. Some of the pipes
carry thought. The work is the same."

Nora had absorbed this philosophy thoroughly. She was thirty-nine, precise
in manner, with short dark hair and steady hands and the particular kind
of calm that comes from years of working inside the human skull. She
specialized in cognitive enhancement — the installation of neural
implants that augmented memory, processing speed, pattern recognition,
and executive function. Her patients were typically professionals seeking
an edge: lawyers who needed to absorb vast quantities of case law,
engineers who needed to hold complex systems in their heads, traders who
needed to process market data faster than their unaugmented competitors.
The procedures were routine, the outcomes were reliable, and the ethical
questions — such as they were — had been debated and resolved years ago.

Gerald Fenn's request had not been resolved.

She turned the intake form over and read it again.

Patient requests installation of cognitive attenuation implant. Target:
reduction of general intelligence by approximately 30 points on the
Wechsler-Fenn scale. Reduction in associative processing, abstract
reasoning, and pattern recognition to levels consistent with population
mean. Patient reports that current cognitive capacity is the primary
source of chronic dissatisfaction and that reduction would improve
quality of life.

Nora pressed the intercom button on her desk. "Send Mr. Fenn in, please."


                               II.

Gerald Fenn was forty-six, tall, with the soft physique and pale
complexion of a man who spent his days indoors and his nights in front
of a screen. He wore a clean but unremarkable suit and a tie that had
been knotted with the precision of someone who has practiced the gesture
until it requires no thought. He sat in the chair across from Nora's
desk with the careful posture of a man who has been in many doctors'
offices and who knows the protocols.

"Mr. Fenn," Nora said. "Thank you for coming in."

"Thank you for seeing me. I understand my request is unusual."

"It is unusual. I'd like to understand it better."

Fenn nodded. He had, Nora noted, the manner of a man who had anticipated
this conversation and prepared for it — not with rehearsed speeches, but
with the kind of quiet, thorough thinking that suggested a mind
accustomed to self-examination.

"I am a claims adjuster," Fenn said. "For Metropolitan Indemnity. I have
held the position for nineteen years."

"I see."

"I am very good at my job. I process claims faster and more accurately
than anyone in the division. My supervisors have noted this in every
annual review. I have been offered promotions, which I have declined."

"Why did you decline?"

"Because the promotions would have placed me in management, where the
work is political rather than analytical. I have no talent for politics.
I have a talent for processing information, finding patterns, and
reaching accurate conclusions. These are the skills that make me an
excellent claims adjuster and that make me, in every other respect,
miserable."

Nora watched his face. It was the face of a man describing a condition
he had lived with for a long time — not with anguish, but with the flat,
exhausted candor of someone who has moved past anguish into something
quieter and more durable.

"Tell me about the misery," she said.

Fenn looked at his hands, which were folded in his lap. "I see too much.
That is the simplest way to put it. My associative processing is — the
tests describe it as 'exceptional.' What it means in practice is that I
cannot look at anything without seeing its connections to everything else.
I cannot have a conversation without analyzing the speaker's motivations,
detecting their deceptions, predicting their responses. I cannot read a
newspaper without mapping the causal chains that link every event to
every other event. I cannot sit in a room with my wife without seeing,
with perfect clarity, the trajectory of our marriage — where it began,
where it is, where it is going."

He paused.

"Where is it going?" Nora asked.

"It is going nowhere. We have been married for twenty-two years. She is a
kind and decent woman who loves me as well as she is able, and I am a
man who is constitutionally incapable of not seeing the gap between what
she feels and what I need. I know — I can calculate — the precise degree
to which our emotional lives fail to intersect. I know the exact
dimensions of the space between us. I know that she does not understand
me, that she cannot understand me, and that the failure is not hers but
mine, because the instrument I was given — this mind — is calibrated for
a frequency that she cannot receive."

"And you believe that reducing your cognitive capacity would close that
gap?"

"I believe it would make the gap invisible. Which, for practical
purposes, is the same thing."

Nora was quiet for a moment. Through the window behind Fenn's head, she
could see the brick wall of the adjacent building, close and featureless.

"Mr. Fenn, the implants I install are designed to enhance function. What
you're describing is attenuation — deliberate reduction. The technology
exists, but it is used primarily for specific therapeutic purposes.
Patients with certain anxiety disorders, for example, who benefit from a
reduction in pattern-recognition sensitivity. Patients with obsessive-
compulsive tendencies who benefit from a reduction in associative
processing. These are targeted interventions for identified pathologies."

"I understand."

"What you're requesting is not a targeted intervention. You're requesting
a general reduction in cognitive capacity. A lowering of the baseline.
You want to be, to put it bluntly, less intelligent."

"Yes."

"That is not a recognized therapeutic goal."

Fenn's expression did not change, but something in his voice shifted —
became harder, more focused, as though he had been holding something in
reserve and had decided to deploy it.

"Dr. Calder, let me describe my typical evening. I come home from work.
My wife has prepared dinner. We eat. She tells me about her day — she is
a receptionist at a dental practice — and I listen, and while I listen I
am simultaneously analyzing the emotional subtext of everything she says,
calculating the probability that the anecdote about her colleague is a
displaced expression of her dissatisfaction with our marriage, noting
that her vocal register has dropped slightly, which indicates either
fatigue or suppressed anger, and mapping the conversational strategies
available to me in response to each possible interpretation. By the time
she has finished speaking, I have processed her words through seventeen
different analytical frameworks and arrived at a comprehensive
understanding of her psychological state. And I have not heard a single
thing she said."

He looked at Nora.

"I do not want to understand my wife. I want to listen to her."


                               III.

Nora discussed the case with Dr. Lowell the following morning, in his
office on the third floor — a cluttered, book-lined room that smelled
of pipe tobacco and old paper.

Lowell was a small man, seventy-four, with a fringe of white hair and
the manner of someone who had spent so long thinking about the nature
of intelligence that his own intelligence had become almost transparent
to him, like a window so clean you forget it's there.

"An attenuation request," he said, turning Fenn's file over in his
hands. "General, not specific."

"General. Thirty points on the Wechsler-Fenn. He wants to be average."

"Average." Lowell set the file on his desk and leaned back in his chair.
"What did the consulting psychiatrists say?"

"Barrow says he's not depressed. No clinical pathology. She says he
presents as a rational individual making a rational request that happens
to be outside the normal parameters of medical practice. Hendricks agrees.
Sane, stable, genuinely unhappy, and convinced that cognitive attenuation
is the solution."

"And what do you think?"

Nora crossed her arms — a gesture she recognized as defensive and did
not modify. "I think he is describing a real problem. Excessive
cognitive capacity as a source of interpersonal alienation — the
literature supports it. The correlation between high intelligence and
social isolation is well-documented. The correlation between high
intelligence and marital dissatisfaction is less well-documented but
consistent with clinical observation."

"That's what you think clinically. What do you think as a human being?"

Nora was silent for a moment. "As a human being, I think he is asking
me to take away the most remarkable thing about him."

"Ah." Lowell picked up his pipe, which was unlit — he had quit smoking
fifteen years ago but still used the pipe as a thinking tool — and
pointed it at her. "And there is the question, isn't it? Is intelligence
a gift or a burden? And if the bearer of the gift says it is a burden,
do we have the right to insist that it is a gift?"

"The Hippocratic principle — "

"The Hippocratic principle says first, do no harm. But harm to what? If
we reduce his intelligence, we harm his cognitive capacity. If we refuse,
we harm his quality of life. He is, by his own account and by the
assessment of two independent psychiatrists, profoundly unhappy. If he
came to us with chronic pain and asked for an implant to reduce his
sensitivity, we would not hesitate."

"Pain is a pathology."

"Is unhappiness not?"

Nora did not answer. Lowell looked at her with the patience of a man who
was not asking a rhetorical question.

"I don't know," she said.

"Good. That is the correct answer at this stage of the inquiry. Schedule
a second evaluation. Get the full psychometric workup. And Nora — talk
to the wife."


                               IV.

Helen Fenn was a small woman with a round face and an open, uncomplicated
manner that Nora found, after hours of clinical analysis, almost
startling in its simplicity. She was not simple — Nora corrected herself
as she made the assessment — she was direct. She said what she meant.
She meant what she said. She did not analyze or strategize. She
communicated.

They met in a consultation room on the second floor, a neutral space
with soft lighting and institutional furniture. Helen sat in her chair
with the posture of a woman who was comfortable in her own body and did
not need to arrange herself for effect.

"Mrs. Fenn — "

"Helen."

"Helen. Your husband has requested a procedure that I'd like to discuss
with you. He has given his consent for me to share the details."

"He told me. The intelligence thing." Helen's voice was matter-of-fact.
"He wants to be less smart."

"That's the essence of it, yes."

"I know." Helen looked at her hands, which were resting on the table
between them. They were practical hands — short nails, a callus on the
right index finger where a pen rested. "He's been talking about it for
years. I thought it was — you know. A thing people say. Like 'I wish
I could turn my brain off.' Everyone says that."

"But he means it literally."

"He means everything literally. That's the problem." Helen paused.
"No. That's not fair. He doesn't mean everything literally. He
means everything precisely. There is no casual thought in Gerald's
head. Everything connects to everything. Everything means something.
Everything is significant."

"What is that like? Living with that?"

Helen was quiet for a long moment. When she spoke, her voice was
careful and, for the first time, uncertain.

"It's lonely. Not because he's cold — he isn't. He's the kindest
man I know. But he's kind the way a doctor is kind. He's kind because
he understands, clinically, what I need, and he provides it. He doesn't
feel it. He calculates it." She paused again. "I don't mean he's
pretending. He's not. He genuinely wants to be good to me. But the
wanting comes from here" — she tapped her forehead — "not from here"
— she touched her chest. "And I can tell the difference. I've always
been able to tell the difference."

Nora made a note. "Do you support his request?"

Helen looked at her — not with the analytical gaze of a person weighing
options, but with the direct, unguarded gaze of a person who has already
made up her mind and is merely deciding whether to say so.

"I want my husband to be happy," she said. "He has never been happy.
Not in twenty-two years. Not for a single day." Her voice did not
waver. "If this will make him happy, then yes. I support it. And if
that makes me a bad person for wanting the man I married to be less
than he is, then I'm a bad person. I can live with that."

Nora put down her pen.

"It doesn't make you a bad person, Helen."

"Doesn't it? I'm asking you to make my husband dumber so that I can
feel loved. That's what it comes down to, isn't it?"

"That's not — "

"That's what it comes down to."

The room was quiet. Through the wall, Nora could hear the faint hum
of the neural mapping equipment on the floor below — a sound she
normally did not notice, the way one does not notice the beating of
one's own heart.


                               V.

The psychometric workup took three days. Gerald Fenn submitted to the
testing with the cooperative patience of a man who had been tested many
times and who knew, with precise certainty, what the results would be.

The results confirmed what the intake data had suggested. Fenn's
cognitive profile was exceptional by any measure. His IQ, on the
Wechsler-Fenn scale, was 168 — placing him in the 99.99th percentile
of the general population. His associative processing speed was in the
highest category the tests could measure. His pattern recognition was
extraordinary. His abstract reasoning was extraordinary. His working
memory was extraordinary.

His emotional intelligence, however, was not extraordinary. It was
normal. Perfectly, precisely, unremarkably normal.

This was the asymmetry that defined Gerald Fenn's life. He had been given
a mind that could process information at a speed and depth that exceeded
virtually every other human being on the planet, but the emotional
apparatus that should have accompanied that mind — the capacity for
empathy, for intuitive connection, for the kind of knowing that does
not require analysis — was calibrated to a different scale entirely. He
could understand any person he met. He could not feel them.

The condition had a name, in the clinical literature: Cognitive-Affective
Dissociation Syndrome. It was not a disorder in the traditional sense —
it was not caused by pathology, injury, or developmental abnormality. It
was simply a configuration. A way of being wired. Some people were
brilliant and empathic. Some people were ordinary and empathic. Some
people were brilliant and not empathic.

Gerald Fenn was brilliant and not empathic, and he wanted the brilliance
reduced so that its absence would matter less.

Nora read the results in her office, alone, and thought about what
medicine was for.


                               VI.

She presented the case at the weekly ethics consultation, a meeting of
six senior clinicians held in the institute's conference room on
Thursday mornings. The consultation was a standing feature of the
institute's practice — Lowell had instituted it in the early days, when
cognitive surgery was new and every case raised questions that no
individual clinician should have to answer alone.

The room was plain and functional. Six chairs around a rectangular table.
No artwork. No windows. The absence of ornament was, like everything at
the Lowell Institute, deliberate. Ethics, in Lowell's view, should be
discussed in rooms that offered no distractions.

Nora presented Fenn's case — the request, the psychometric data, the
consulting evaluations, the interview with Helen — and waited for
the discussion.

Dr. Marcus Webb spoke first. He was the institute's chief ethicist,
a lanky man with a precise beard and a habit of speaking in complete
paragraphs.

"The central question is whether cognitive attenuation for the purpose
of improving subjective well-being constitutes a legitimate therapeutic
goal. The literature is divided. The Beauchamp-Childress framework would
suggest that patient autonomy is paramount — the patient is competent,
informed, and making a voluntary request. Under a strict autonomy model,
we should proceed."

"Unless we invoke nonmaleficence," said Dr. Priya Banerjee, a
neuropsychologist with a soft voice and a reputation for asking the
question no one wanted asked. "Are we doing harm if we reduce his
cognitive capacity? Even at his request?"

"Define harm," Webb said.

"Loss of capability. He will be less able to think, reason, analyze.
Those are capacities. Their reduction is a harm."

"A harm he has consented to."

"People consent to harmful things all the time. That's why we have
an ethics consultation."

"The comparison to cosmetic surgery is relevant," said Dr. James Okwu,
the most junior member of the panel and the most likely to cite
precedent. "Patients request the removal of functional tissue — healthy
breasts, excess skin, prominent noses — for the purpose of improving
subjective well-being. We do not, as a profession, refuse these requests
on the grounds that the tissue is functional."

"Breasts are not intelligence," Banerjee said.

"The principle is the same. The patient's quality of life is the
metric."

"The principle is not the same, and I think you know that." Banerjee
leaned forward. "We are not talking about tissue. We are talking about
the organ of selfhood. The mind is not a breast. When we modify the
mind, we modify the person. The Gerald Fenn who walks out of this
institute after a thirty-point attenuation will not be the Gerald Fenn
who walked in. He will be a different person. A less capable person. And
the Gerald Fenn who consented to the procedure — the brilliant, unhappy,
fully competent Gerald Fenn — will no longer exist."

The room was silent.

"That," Lowell said quietly, from his chair at the head of the table,
"is the real question, isn't it? Not whether we have the right to do
it. But whether the person who consents to it will be the same person
who experiences the result."

"He will experience the result as happiness," Webb said. "He has said
as much."

"The person who experiences the result will experience it as happiness,"
Banerjee corrected. "That person will not be the person who consented.
They will be someone else — someone who lacks the cognitive capacity
to understand what was lost."

"You're describing every medical procedure that alters consciousness,"
Okwu said. "Anesthesia. Psychotropic medication. Grief counseling.
We change people's minds all the time. We call it treatment."

"There is a difference between changing a mind and reducing one."

"Is there?"

Nora listened to the argument circle and circle, the way arguments in
ethics consultations always did — not because the participants lacked
the intelligence to resolve the question, but because the question was
genuinely unresolvable. It occupied the boundary between two legitimate
principles — autonomy and nonmaleficence — and no amount of deliberation
could reconcile them, because they were, in this case, fundamentally
opposed.

Lowell let the discussion run for ninety minutes. Then he raised his
hand — a gesture so understated that it took several seconds for the
room to notice — and the conversation stopped.

"We are not going to resolve this," he said. "The question has no
resolution. It is a genuine dilemma — a case in which every available
action is both justified and objectionable. In such cases, the decision
falls to the treating physician." He looked at Nora. "Dr. Calder. This
is your patient. What will you do?"


                               VII.

Nora went for a walk.

She walked along the Charles River, in the November cold, with her hands
in her coat pockets and her breath making small clouds in the air. The
river was gray and flat. The trees on the Cambridge side were bare. Crew
teams were practicing on the water, their oars striking the surface
with a sound like muffled applause.

She thought about Gerald Fenn. About his steady voice describing an
evening at home, the seventeen analytical frameworks, the inability to
hear what his wife was saying because he was too busy understanding it.
She thought about Helen Fenn, her direct gaze and practical hands and
the sentence that Nora had not been able to stop hearing: "I'm asking
you to make my husband dumber so that I can feel loved."

She thought about what medicine was for.

The question was not new. She had asked it in medical school, in
residency, in the first years of practice when every case seemed to
carry the weight of a philosophical argument. She had arrived, over time,
at an answer that satisfied her: medicine was for the relief of
suffering. Not the optimization of function, not the perfection of the
organism, but the relief of suffering. When a person suffered, the
physician's task was to reduce that suffering by the means available.

Gerald Fenn was suffering. The suffering was real, documented,
persistent, and resistant to conventional treatment. He had tried
therapy, meditation, medication. Nothing worked, because the source of
his suffering was not a pathology but a capacity — the very capacity
that medicine was designed to preserve and enhance.

The capacity itself was the problem.

Nora stopped walking and stood at the river's edge, watching the crew
teams move through the gray water with their synchronized, mechanical
precision.

If a patient came to her with hyperacusis — an abnormally heightened
sense of hearing that caused chronic pain — she would not hesitate to
install an implant that reduced auditory sensitivity. The patient would
hear less. The patient would suffer less. The trade-off was clear.

Was Gerald Fenn's condition different? His cognitive sensitivity caused
him pain. Reducing it would reduce the pain. The mechanism was the same.
The organ was different.

But the organ was the mind.

And the mind was the self.

And reducing the mind was reducing the self.

And the self that consented was not the self that would live with the
consequences.

Nora stood by the river for a long time. The crew teams finished their
practice and rowed to shore. The gray light dimmed. The temperature
dropped. She did not move.


                               VIII.

She saw Gerald Fenn for his third appointment on a Tuesday afternoon,
ten days after the ethics consultation. She had spent those ten days
reviewing literature, consulting with colleagues at other institutions,
and lying awake at three o'clock in the morning staring at her ceiling,
which was not a recognized clinical methodology but which she found,
under the circumstances, more productive than the alternatives.

"Mr. Fenn," she said. "I've completed my evaluation."

Fenn sat in his chair with the same careful posture, the same clean
suit, the same precisely knotted tie. His expression was the expression
of a man waiting for a verdict he has already calculated.

"You're going to say no," he said.

"I am going to say something more complicated than no."

Fenn waited.

"I believe your suffering is real," Nora said. "I believe cognitive
attenuation would alleviate it. I believe you are competent to make
this decision and that your consent is informed and voluntary. Under
the principle of patient autonomy, I should proceed."

"But."

"But I am not able to do it."

Fenn's expression did not change. He had expected this. She could see the
calculation behind his eyes — the rapid processing, the assessment of
her reasoning, the formulation of counterarguments.

"May I ask why?"

"Because the person who will benefit from the procedure is not the
person who is asking for it. The Gerald Fenn sitting in that chair has
an IQ of 168 and a lifetime of experience with the capabilities and
limitations of that intelligence. The Gerald Fenn who would leave this
institute after a thirty-point attenuation would have an IQ of 138 — still
well above average, but fundamentally different in kind. He would not
think the way you think. He would not see the way you see. He would be
happier, I believe. But he would not be you."

"That is the point."

"I know it is the point. And that is why I am unable to do it. You are
asking me to replace you with someone else — someone you would prefer
to be, someone your wife would prefer to live with, someone who would
function more comfortably in the world. But you would not experience
that comfort. Someone else would. You — the you who is asking —
would simply cease to exist."

The room was quiet. Fenn looked at his hands.

"Dr. Calder," he said. "I have spent forty-six years being the person
I am. I have considered this decision from every angle that my
considerable intelligence allows me to consider. And I have concluded,
with the same rigor I apply to everything, that the person I am is not
a person I wish to continue being."

"I understand."

"Then what gives you the right to overrule me?"

Nora felt the weight of the question settle over her like a physical
thing.

"Nothing," she said. "Nothing gives me the right. I am not overruling
you. I am declining to perform the procedure. Another surgeon may
decide differently. I am not the only practitioner in this field."

"But you are the one I chose."

"Yes."

"Because I read your work. Because you understand what these implants
do — not just mechanically, but experientially. Because you wrote, in
your paper on cognitive enhancement ethics, that 'the purpose of
neural modification is not to make the patient more capable but to
bring the patient's capabilities into alignment with their needs.'"

"I wrote that."

"My need is to be less capable."

Nora closed her eyes. When she opened them, Fenn was watching her with
an expression she had not seen before — not analytical, not calculated,
but raw. The expression of a man who had run out of arguments and was
left with nothing but the bare, unprocessed fact of his unhappiness.

"I know," she said. "And I am sorry."


                               IX.

Fenn left the institute that afternoon. He thanked Nora at the door — a
formal, precise thank-you, delivered with the same controlled courtesy
he had maintained throughout — and walked out into the Cambridge cold.

Nora watched him go from the window of her office. He walked to the
corner, waited for the light to change, and crossed the street. He did
not look back. His posture was the posture of a man who had received
bad news and was processing it in the only way he knew how: methodically,
completely, alone.

She sat at her desk and opened his file. The file was complete — the
intake form, the psychometric data, the consultation notes, the ethics
review. She added her final note:

"Procedure declined. Patient referred to alternative providers per
standard protocol. Treating physician's assessment: the attenuation
requested would constitute a fundamental alteration of the patient's
identity and is not, in this physician's judgment, consistent with the
therapeutic mandate. Physician acknowledges that this judgment is
contestable and that reasonable practitioners may disagree."

She signed the note, closed the file, and placed it in her outbox.

Then she sat in her office, in the fading afternoon light, and thought
about Gerald Fenn walking home to his wife. Walking through the door.
Sitting down to dinner. Listening to her describe her day while his
mind, his extraordinary, relentless, inescapable mind, processed every
word through seventeen analytical frameworks and failed, again, to hear
what she was saying.

She thought about Helen, waiting at home, knowing that her husband had
gone to a doctor who might have been able to fix the thing that was
broken between them, and knowing that the doctor had said no.

She thought about what medicine was for.

She did not have an answer.

She was not certain, anymore, that there was one.


                               X.

Three months later, Nora received a letter. It was handwritten — an
anachronism that she recognized, even before she opened it, as
characteristic of Gerald Fenn. The handwriting was small and precise.

Dear Dr. Calder,

I am writing to inform you that I underwent the attenuation procedure
at the Hoffman Clinic in Baltimore six weeks ago. Dr. Markus performed
the surgery. The results are consistent with the target parameters.

I am writing to you because I want you to know that you were right,
and because I want you to know that it does not matter.

You were right that the person who asked for the procedure is not the
person who received it. I am not the Gerald Fenn who sat in your office.
I know this because I have read my own notes from that period — notes
that I wrote in preparation for the procedure, knowing that I would
want a record of the person I had been — and I do not fully understand
them. Not all of them. The reasoning is too dense in places, the
connections too remote. I can see that the person who wrote them was
more intelligent than I am. I can see the shape of what he understood,
the way one can see the shape of a mountain through fog.

But I can also see my wife.

Not analyze her. Not process her. See her. Hear her. Sit across the
table from her and listen to what she is saying without simultaneously
computing what she means. I came home from work last Tuesday and she
told me about a funny thing that happened at the dental office — a child
who was afraid of the hygienist and hid under the waiting room chairs —
and I laughed. Not because I calculated that laughter was the
appropriate response. Because it was funny.

You were right that I am not the same person. The person I was would
have understood this letter better than I do. He would have seen its
implications, traced its connections, analyzed its emotional subtext.
He would have understood it completely, and it would have meant nothing
to him.

I understand it less. It means everything.

I do not blame you for refusing. You acted according to your principles,
and your principles were sound. But I am glad that someone else was
willing to act according to mine.

                              Yours,
                              Gerald Fenn

Nora read the letter twice. Then she folded it, placed it in the file,
and closed the file.

She sat at her desk for a long time, looking at the brick wall through
her window.

She did not know whether she had been right.

She did not know whether Markus had been right.

She knew only that Gerald Fenn — the Gerald Fenn who now existed, the
one who could laugh at a funny story about a child under a chair — was
happy. And that the Gerald Fenn who had existed before — the one who
had sat in her office and described his unhappiness with the precision of
a surgical instrument — was gone. Not dead. Not injured. Gone. Replaced
by someone who was, by every measurable standard, less. Less intelligent.
Less perceptive. Less capable.

And more.

More present. More connected. More able to sit in a room with the woman
he loved and hear what she was saying.

Nora Calder, who had spent eleven years installing implants that made
people more capable, closed the file of the patient who had wanted to be
less, and went back to work.

================================================================================

                          SEVENTH SON

                         by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                               I.

I should set down what happened on Tir na Caillte while I am still able
to distinguish what I saw from what I dreamed, though I confess the
border between the two has grown uncertain, as borders tend to do in that
place.

My name is Declan Byrne. I was twenty-three years old when I arrived on
Tir na Caillte with the fourth wave of settlers from Cork, and I am
twenty-seven now as I write this, though I feel older by far. Four years
is not a long time, measured by the clock. Measured by what I have seen,
it is an eternity.

Tir na Caillte — the name means "land of the lost" in the Irish, though
Father Conneely, who named it, insisted it meant "land of the forest,"
which is the more charitable translation and the less accurate one. The
colony had been established eight years before my arrival by a private
charter from the Hibernian Colonization Trust, which had secured
settlement rights to a world in the Tau Ceti system and had advertised
it to the people of Ireland as a new beginning. A fresh world. A green
world. The old songs made new.

The reality, as realities tend to be, was more complicated.

The world was not green, or not entirely. The forests that covered the
equatorial continent — the only landmass large enough to settle — were
composed of organisms that resembled trees in form but were, in their
biology, something else entirely: vast, slow-growing structures with
trunks of a substance that was neither wood nor stone but something in
between, and canopies of broad, flat leaves that were not leaves at all
but sensory organs, photosensitive membranes that tracked the movement
of Tau Ceti across the sky with a deliberateness that I found, from the
first day, unsettling. The forest watched you. I do not mean this as a
metaphor. The leaves turned as you passed, following your movement the
way a field of sunflowers follows the sun, and the effect — thousands of
broad, dark membranes swiveling in unison as you walked beneath them —
was enough to make the bravest man quicken his step.

The colony itself was a cluster of prefabricated structures and
hand-built cottages arranged around a central green in a pattern that
the first settlers had modeled, with touching deliberateness, on an
Irish village. There was a church, a pub, a school, and a scattering of
farms that extended into the cleared land at the forest's edge. The
population, when I arrived, was approximately three thousand souls, and
they had settled into the rhythms of colonial life with the stubborn
adaptability that is the Irishman's most undervalued virtue.

I had come because there was nothing for me in Cork. My father was dead,
my mother was dead, and my six older brothers had divided the family's
resources among themselves with the cheerful efficiency of men who had
learned early that sentiment was a luxury the seventh son could not
afford. I had no trade, no education beyond the secondary school, and
no prospects that I could identify. The Hibernian Trust's brochures
promised land, work, and a future. I was skeptical of all three
promises but accepted them on the grounds that skepticism, without an
alternative, is merely pessimism.

What the brochures did not mention — what no one mentioned, until you
had been on Tir na Caillte long enough to earn the telling — was the
Sight.


                               II.

I learned about the Sight from Padraig Quinn, who ran the pub and who
was, by general agreement, the repository of everything that was known
on Tir na Caillte and a fair amount that was merely suspected.

Quinn was a large man with red hair going to gray and the kind of face
that looks as though it was designed for amiability but has been modified
by experience into something more cautious. He had been among the first
settlers, eight years earlier, and he had the authority that comes from
having survived what others had not.

I had been on the planet for three weeks when Quinn sat down across from
me in his pub — a low-ceilinged room with a turf fire that burned a
local fuel that smelled like peat but was not peat — and said, without
preamble, "You're a seventh son."

"I am," I said.

"Seventh son of a seventh son?"

"No. My father was a third son. Is that important?"

Quinn looked at me for a long moment with an expression I could not read.
"It might be. It might not. The thing about this place is, it doesn't
follow the rules you'd expect. But seventh sons — seventh sons are
different here."

I waited for him to continue. He took a drink of his ale — brewed from
a local grain that tasted of nothing familiar — and continued.

"You know the old stories. Seventh sons have the gift. Second sight.
The seeing. In Ireland, it was superstition — my grandmother believed it,
my mother half-believed it, and I didn't believe it at all. But on Tir
na Caillte..." He trailed off and looked into his glass. "The planet
has a magnetic field. Different from Earth's. Stronger in some ways,
weaker in others, and structured in a way that the scientists don't fully
understand. Something to do with the core — it's not iron, like Earth's.
It's something else. And whatever it is, it interacts with the human
nervous system. Not with everyone. Not randomly. With seventh sons."

"You're telling me that seventh sons have psychic powers on this planet."

Quinn winced. "I wouldn't use the word 'psychic.' The scientists hate
that word, and I've learned not to annoy scientists. What seventh sons
have — what they develop, after a few months of exposure to the field —
is a sensitivity. A receptivity. They pick up... signals. From the
field. And those signals correspond to events."

"Future events?"

"Future events. Always future events." He looked at me again, and this
time I could read his expression. It was pity. "And always death."

I set down my glass.

"It starts small," Quinn said. "A feeling. Like you know something is
going to happen, but you can't say what. Then it gets clearer. You see
things — not with your eyes. With something else. Something the field
activates. You see how people are going to die."

"Everyone?"

"No. Not everyone. That's the mercy, if you want to call it that. You
see specific deaths. The ones that are close. The ones that are soon.
The ones that..." He paused, choosing his words. "The ones that the field
considers significant. I don't know why some and not others. Nobody does."

I sat in Quinn's pub, in the firelight, with the sound of the alien wind
outside and the faint, perpetual rustle of the forest, and I felt — not
fear, exactly. Something older than fear. The recognition that the world
was not what I had believed it to be, and that the new shape of it was
not one I would have chosen.

"How many seventh sons are there on Tir na Caillte?" I asked.

"Twelve," Quinn said. "Including you."

"And they all have this... sensitivity?"

"They all develop it. Some faster than others. Some stronger than
others." He finished his ale. "Most of them leave, eventually. Go back
to Earth. The Trust doesn't talk about it, because it's bad for
recruitment. But most of them leave."

"And the ones who stay?"

Quinn looked at the fire. The fuel crackled and spat a spark that
landed on the stone hearth and died.

"The ones who stay," he said, "learn to live with it. Or they don't."


                               III.

The first vision came six weeks after my arrival, and Quinn had been
right: it started small.

I was walking along the path between the village and the Quinn farm —
a track of compressed alien soil that wound through the cleared fields
at the forest's edge — when I felt, with a sudden and inexplicable
certainty, that I should not take the next step.

I stopped. There was nothing unusual about the path ahead of me. The
same gray-brown soil. The same low scrub on either side. The same
overcast sky, the color of unpolished silver. The forest wall to my left,
its leaves tracking my stillness with their slow, attentive turns.

But the certainty was absolute. The next step — that specific step, on
that specific piece of ground — was wrong. It was dangerous. It was,
in a way I could not articulate, full of death.

I stood on the path for perhaps five minutes, my heart beating with a
violence that seemed disproportionate to the situation, and then I
stepped off the path and walked around the spot that had frightened me.
The feeling dissipated immediately, like a scent carried away by wind.

Two hours later, I learned that Eamon Burke — a farmer who worked the
plot adjacent to Quinn's — had been killed that morning when his tractor
rolled on a hillside. He had been found on the path between the village
and the Quinn farm, at approximately the spot where I had stopped.

I went to Quinn's pub that evening and told him what had happened. He
listened without surprise.

"It doesn't always work that way," he said. "Sometimes it's a feeling.
Sometimes it's a picture — a flash, like a photograph. Sometimes it's
a dream. But it's always death, and it's always true."

"Can it be prevented? If I see someone's death, can I — "

"No." Quinn's voice was flat and final. "That's the cruelty of it.
You see what's going to happen, and you can't stop it. You can avoid
the place — the way you did today. You can keep yourself away from the
dying. But you can't change it. The field doesn't show you possibilities.
It shows you certainties."

"How do you know that?"

"Because seventh sons have tried. God knows they've tried. They've
warned people. They've physically restrained people. They've changed
circumstances, altered plans, locked doors. And the death happens
anyway. Different time, different place, same result. The field shows
you the fact, not the method. The method can change. The fact can't."

I thought about this for a long time.

"Then what good is it?" I asked. "What good is seeing something you
can't prevent?"

Quinn poured himself another ale. The fire crackled. Outside, the
alien wind moved through the forest, and the leaves rustled with a
sound like ten thousand whispered conversations.

"No good," he said. "No good at all."


                               IV.

Over the following months, the visions became more frequent and more
vivid, and each one was, as Quinn had promised, about death.

I saw the death of Mary Considine, an old woman who lived alone at the
edge of the village, three days before her heart stopped in the night.
The vision came to me as a dream — I saw her sitting in her chair by
the fire, her knitting in her lap, and I saw her face change, the color
draining from it like water from a basin, and I saw her hands go still.
When I woke, I knew she was going to die, and I knew that I could not
save her.

I saw the death of young Connor Spillane, aged eight, who drowned in
the river that the colonists called the Shannon, though it bore no
resemblance to the Shannon and its waters were the color of weak tea.
The vision came as a flash while I was eating lunch — a sudden image,
sharp and terrible, of a small body face-down in brown water — and I
dropped my fork and sat gasping while the image faded and the ordinary
world returned, indifferent and unchanged.

I tried, despite Quinn's warning, to prevent Connor's death. I went to
his mother, Siobhan, and told her to keep the boy away from the river.
I did not tell her why — I had learned quickly that revealing the source
of my knowledge produced not gratitude but fear and, eventually,
hostility. I said only that the river was running high and that I had
seen debris in the water that might be dangerous. Siobhan thanked me
and kept Connor home for two days.

On the third day, Connor slipped out while his mother was at the
communal laundry and went to the river. He was found an hour later,
face-down in the brown water, exactly as I had seen.

I went to Quinn's pub and drank until I could not see anything at all,
and Quinn sat with me and said nothing, because there was nothing to say.

The visions did not come every day. There were weeks — sometimes two
or three weeks together — when I felt nothing, when the planet's
magnetic field seemed to have forgotten me, and I could walk the paths
and work in the fields and sit in the pub without the constant,
crawling awareness that someone nearby was going to die and that I was
going to know about it before it happened.

But they always returned. And each time they returned, they were clearer,
more detailed, more insistent. The field was, I realized, teaching me.
Training my nervous system to receive its signals with increasing
fidelity. I was becoming a better antenna, whether I wanted to or not.


                               V.

I met the other seventh sons at a gathering that Quinn organized in
the back room of his pub, six months after my arrival. There were
nine of us — three had already left the planet, as Quinn had predicted.

They were a varied group: farmers, mechanics, a teacher, a doctor's
assistant. What they shared was an expression — a particular quality of
the eyes, a watchfulness that was not quite fear and not quite
resignation but something in between. The expression of people who
knew something they wished they did not know and who had no one to tell.

The gathering was informal. Quinn poured ale and we sat in a circle and
spoke about what it was like. There was no agenda, no structure, no
pretense that we were solving a problem. We were sharing a burden, the
way people do when the burden cannot be lifted but can, for an hour, be
distributed.

Ciaran Doyle, a farmer from the northern settlement, told us about
seeing the death of his own father — a massive stroke that took the
old man in his sleep, three months after Ciaran's visions began. He
had seen it coming for two weeks, watching the vision grow clearer and
more detailed with each passing day, knowing what was approaching and
unable to speak of it or prevent it.

"The worst part," Ciaran said, in a voice that was steady in the way
that a rope is steady when it is pulled taut, "was that I couldn't
grieve properly. When it happened, I'd already seen it so many times
that it felt like a memory. Like something that had happened years ago.
Everyone else was shocked. I was tired."

Maeve Sullivan, who taught at the village school, said that the visions
had made her afraid of her students. "I look at them and I'm terrified
of what I might see. Every morning, I walk into that classroom and I
pray — I actually pray, and I haven't prayed since I was a girl — that
today will not be the day I see one of their deaths."

"Has it happened?" someone asked.

Maeve's silence was answer enough.

Dr. Aidan Flynn, who worked as an assistant at the colony's small
medical clinic, said that the visions had, paradoxically, made him
better at his job. "I know when a patient is going to die. I can't
prevent it, but I can... prepare. I can make sure they're comfortable.
I can make sure their families are ready. It's not much. But it's
something."

"It's something for them," Ciaran said. "What is it for you?"

Flynn looked at his hands. "A reason to stay."

I listened to each of them and recognized, in each account, the outline
of my own experience — the same progression from shock to disbelief to
reluctant acceptance, the same oscillation between the desire to help
and the knowledge that help was impossible, the same corrosive awareness
that the future, for a seventh son on Tir na Caillte, was not a place
of possibilities but a place of certainties, and that the certainties
were always the same.

Death. Always death.

I asked the question that had been forming in my mind since Quinn first
told me about the Sight.

"Has anyone ever seen their own death?"

The room went quiet. The kind of quiet that answers a question by refusing
to answer it.

Finally, Ciaran spoke. "Tomas Meehan. He was one of the first seventh
sons. Saw his own death about a year after the visions started. Heart
attack, apparently. He didn't tell anyone, but his wife found a letter
after — after it happened. He'd written down what he saw, date and all.
It was accurate."

"He saw the date?"

"He saw everything. The visions get that detailed, toward the end."

I absorbed this information the way one absorbs a blow — not by
deflecting it but by allowing it to pass through and noting the damage
afterward.

"How long do we have?" I asked. "Before the visions get that detailed?"

"Varies," Ciaran said. "Tomas was here three years before he saw his
own. Some of the others — the ones who left — their visions were getting
stronger by the end of their first year. The field affects everyone
differently."

"But it always gets stronger."

"It always gets stronger."

I nodded. I finished my ale. I thanked Quinn and Ciaran and Maeve and
the others, and I walked back to my cottage through the alien darkness,
under the alien stars, through the forest whose leaves tracked my
passage with their slow, attentive turns.

The wind moved through the canopy, and the leaves rustled, and the
sound was like ten thousand whispered conversations, each one a secret,
each one about the same thing.


                               VI.

I stayed on Tir na Caillte. I could not, afterward, explain why.

The rational thing would have been to leave. To return to Earth, to
Cork, to the familiar miseries of a life without prospects. At least
on Earth, the future was uncertain. At least on Earth, I could look at
the people around me without the crawling fear that I might, at any
moment, see the manner and the time of their deaths.

But I stayed. And the reason, if there was a reason, was this: I had
found, on Tir na Caillte, something I had not had in Cork. A community
that needed me. Not for the Sight — the Sight was a curse, not a gift,
and no one wanted it. But for what the Sight had made me. A man who
understood, with a depth that no ordinary experience could provide, that
life was brief and fragile and unspeakably valuable. A man who could
sit with a dying person and be unafraid. A man who could attend a birth
and weep with genuine joy, because he knew, in a way that others
could only suspect, what a miracle it was that anything lived at all.

The field had broken something in me. But the broken place had healed
in a way that left me — I will not say stronger. I do not believe that
suffering makes you stronger. But it had left me useful. And usefulness,
for a seventh son who had never had any before, was worth the price.

I write this in my cottage, by the light of a lamp that burns the local
fuel with its faint peat-like smell, and outside the wind moves through
the forest and the leaves rustle and the stars of an alien sky turn
slowly above a world that watches you with ten thousand eyes.

I have not yet seen my own death. The visions grow stronger month by
month, and I know that the day will come — perhaps soon, perhaps not
for years — when the field will show me what it has shown me about so
many others. The certain fact of my ending. The date. The manner. The
place.

I am not afraid. Or rather, I am afraid, but the fear has become
familiar, like the sound of the wind or the rustling of the leaves,
and I have learned to live with it the way the people of Tir na Caillte
have learned to live with the forest that watches them and the field
that knows their futures and the strange, melancholy gift that the
planet gives to its seventh sons.

Quinn asked me once why I didn't leave.

I told him the truth. "Because the seeing is terrible. But the not-
seeing was worse."

He looked at me for a long time, and then he nodded, and then he poured
us both another ale, and we sat by the fire and talked about nothing,
the way friends do when everything important has already been said.

                              [THE END]

================================================================================

                        AFTER THE DELUGE

                        by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                               I.

The water was always there. That was the first thing you learned, growing
up on New Galveston. The water was there when you woke and there when
you slept and there in your dreams, which were mostly about water. It
stretched in every direction from the edge of the platform, gray-green
and moving, and it did not end. It did not end because there was nowhere
for it to end. The whole world was water now, and had been for longer
than anyone living could remember, and the platforms — the forty-seven
artificial islands that held what was left of the human population —
floated on its surface the way a leaf floats on a puddle: small, and
temporary, and subject to forces it could not control.

Ruth Alder was seventeen years old and she had never seen dry land.

She knew about dry land. Everyone on New Galveston knew about dry land.
The teachers talked about it in school — showed pictures, played old
recordings, described mountains and deserts and forests and plains with
the careful precision of people describing a foreign country they had
never visited. Ruth had seen photographs of wheat fields and city
streets and parking lots and beaches — especially beaches, which were
the strangest of all, because a beach was a place where the land and the
water met, and on New Galveston the water did not meet the land. It
simply was.

Ruth's grandmother, Evelyn, had been born before the Deluge. She was
eighty-one years old and she was the oldest person on New Galveston and
she did not talk about the time before. None of the elders did. The
children asked, of course — children always ask — but the elders
deflected with a skill that Ruth had come to recognize as practiced.
They changed the subject. They said "that was a long time ago" in a tone
that closed the door. They looked out at the water with an expression
that Ruth could not read.

Ruth had stopped asking. She had learned that some silences were not
empty. They were full of something that the people keeping them did not
want to let out.

She lived with her grandmother and her mother, Ada, on Platform Seven,
Section D, Block 12 — a housing unit that consisted of three rooms, a
shared bathroom, and a small balcony overlooking the eastern edge of the
platform, where the recycling barges docked and the fish farms extended
in their neat geometric rows out into the open water. The platform itself
was roughly circular, two kilometers in diameter, and it held six
thousand people in an arrangement that was more efficient than comfortable.
The buildings were low and flat-roofed, built from recycled composite
and painted in the pale blues and greens that the original designers had
chosen, sixty years ago, because research suggested these colors were
calming. Ruth did not find them calming. She found them institutional.
But she had never said so, because complaining about the platform was
something that adults did, and Ruth was not yet interested in doing the
things that adults did.

What Ruth was interested in was the Archive.


                               II.

The Archive was housed in a reinforced structure at the center of
Platform Seven, a building that had no windows and one door and that
was, by common understanding, the most important building on the
platform. It contained the records — all the records. The technical
manuals for the platform's systems. The census data. The agricultural
protocols. The medical library. The educational curricula. And the
historical files, which documented everything that had happened since
the platforms were built, including the period before the Deluge and
the Deluge itself.

Most of the Archive was accessible to anyone who requested it. The
technical manuals, the medical library, the agricultural data — these
were open records, available on any terminal. But the historical files
from the pre-Deluge period were restricted. Access required authorization
from the Platform Council, and the Platform Council did not grant
authorization.

Ruth knew this because she had applied. Twice. She had submitted formal
requests through the educational office, citing her interest in history
and her intention to pursue a career in archival management — a career
that did not, strictly speaking, exist on New Galveston, but that Ruth
had invented for the purpose of the application. Both requests had been
denied, with the same form language: "The requested materials are
classified under Council Resolution 7, Section 3.2, pertaining to
records whose release is deemed not in the public interest."

"Not in the public interest" was a phrase that Ruth had learned to
recognize as a lock on a door that someone did not want opened.

She was thinking about this lock — and about how locks, in her
experience, were only as strong as the willingness of the people behind
them to enforce them — when she found the journal.


                               III.

The journal was in a box of old paper documents that had been donated
to the school library by the estate of Henrik Moller, a retired
engineer who had died the previous month. Ruth volunteered at the
library two afternoons a week — not out of civic virtue but because
the librarian, Mrs. Okoro, let her read anything she wanted and did
not ask questions about why — and she had been sorting through Moller's
donation when she found, at the bottom of a box of technical manuals,
a leather-bound notebook with no label on the spine.

She opened it. The handwriting inside was small and neat, the kind of
handwriting that belongs to a person who was taught to write by hand
and who took the instruction seriously. The first entry was dated
sixty-three years ago — three years before the Deluge.

Ruth sat down on the floor of the library storage room, surrounded by
boxes of an old man's papers, and began to read.

The journal belonged to Dr. Elias Moller — Henrik's father. He had been,
according to the first pages, a senior engineer at the International
Geoengineering Consortium, the organization that had designed and built
the platforms. Ruth knew about the IGC from school — it was the body
that had overseen the construction of the artificial islands in the
decade before the Deluge, when it became clear that rising sea levels
would submerge most of the world's habitable land. The platforms were
humanity's lifeboat, and the IGC had built them with the grim efficiency
of people working against a deadline they could not extend.

That was the story Ruth had learned in school. The Deluge was a natural
catastrophe — the result of centuries of atmospheric warming that had
melted the ice caps and raised the oceans by ninety meters, drowning
the continents and leaving only the highest mountains as scattered
islands in a world of water. Humanity had seen it coming, had built
the platforms as a last resort, and had survived — diminished, but
alive. It was a story about resilience. About the stubborn refusal
of the human species to die.

Dr. Elias Moller's journal told a different story.


                               IV.

Ruth read the journal over the course of three days, sitting in the
storage room with the door closed, her heart beating with a steadiness
that surprised her because the words on the pages should have made it
race.

The story in the journal was this:

The sea level rise was real. The warming was real. The ice caps were
melting. These were facts that no one disputed. But the models — the
climate models that the IGC used to project the rate of sea level rise —
showed that the process would take centuries. Not decades. Centuries.
The warming was gradual. The melting was gradual. The rise was measurable,
dangerous, and slow. Slow enough for adaptation. Slow enough for coastal
retreat, for new construction on higher ground, for the orderly
relocation of populations from vulnerable areas. Slow enough that the
platforms, while useful as emergency staging areas, would not be needed
as permanent habitations for at least two hundred years.

The Consortium knew this. The governments knew this. The scientists knew
this.

And they had decided that two hundred years was too long to wait.

Not because they were impatient. Because they had looked at the models —
not just the climate models, but the social models, the economic models,
the geopolitical models — and they had concluded that human civilization,
as it existed, would not survive two hundred years of gradual decline.
The wars over resources. The mass migrations. The political instability.
The rise of authoritarian regimes. The slow, grinding collapse of the
international order. The models showed — with the same cold precision
that the climate models showed the melting of the ice — that by the time
the oceans rose high enough to require the platforms, there would be no
civilization left to save.

So they had made a decision.

They would accelerate the process.

Dr. Moller's journal described the technology in terms that Ruth could
follow, though she was not an engineer. A series of thermal devices,
deployed in the deep ocean near the Antarctic ice shelf. Not bombs —
the journal was emphatic on this point — but targeted thermal generators
that would accelerate the melting of the ice sheet by a factor of
approximately fifty. The process, once initiated, would be irreversible.
The ice would melt. The seas would rise. Not over centuries, but over
months. The old world — the continents, the cities, the farmland, the
forests — would be drowned. Quickly. Completely. Irrecoverably.

And the platforms, already built and provisioned, would be there to
catch the survivors.

Not all the survivors. The platforms could hold ten million people.
The world's population, at the time, was eleven billion. The mathematics
of this disparity was a subject that Dr. Moller addressed in his journal
with the controlled anguish of a man who had performed the calculation
and could not stop performing it.

"We are choosing," he wrote, on a page that was stained with what might
have been water or might have been tears, "to drown the world in order
to save the species. We are choosing to kill billions in order that
millions might live. We are choosing to commit the greatest act of
destruction in human history in order to prevent an even greater act of
destruction — the slow, chaotic, uncontrolled collapse of everything
humanity has built. We are choosing the flood over the drought. The
swift death over the slow one. The controlled catastrophe over the
uncontrolled catastrophe.

"And God help us, I believe we are right."


                               V.

Ruth closed the journal and sat in the storage room for a long time.

The room was small and windowless. The boxes of Henrik Moller's papers
surrounded her like walls within walls. The overhead light hummed. She
could hear, through the building's structure, the faint constant sound
of the water — the sound that was always there, that was the sound of
her world, the only sound she had ever known as continuous and
inescapable.

She thought about the water.

She had been taught that the Deluge was a natural disaster. A consequence
of human carelessness — of centuries of burning fossil fuels and ignoring
the warnings of scientists. The moral of the story, as the teachers told
it, was that humanity had paid the price for its greed and its shortsight-
edness, and that the survivors' duty was to build a better world on the
water, a world that would not repeat the mistakes of the old one.

The moral of the story, it turned out, was wrong.

The Deluge was not a consequence. It was a decision. Made by people who
believed they were saving the world. Made with full knowledge of what
it would cost. Made, according to Dr. Moller's journal, after years of
debate and anguish and analysis, by a group of people who had concluded
that the alternative — the slow collapse, the centuries of chaos, the
eventual extinction — was worse.

Ruth sat in the storage room and tried to feel what she was supposed to
feel. Anger, she thought. She should feel anger. Billions of people had
been killed — deliberately, purposefully, by the people who were supposed
to be saving them. The platforms had been built not as a last resort but
as the first step in a plan to destroy the old world and replace it with
something smaller, more manageable, more controllable. The elders' silence
about the time before was not the silence of grief. It was the silence
of guilt.

But anger was not what Ruth felt. What she felt was something closer to
vertigo — the sensation of the ground shifting beneath her feet, except
that there was no ground. There had never been any ground. There was
only the platform, floating on the water that had been put there on
purpose by people who thought they knew what they were doing.


                               VI.

She went to her grandmother.

Evelyn Alder sat in her chair by the window, the way she always sat,
looking out at the water. She was eighty-one years old and her hair was
white and her hands, resting on the arms of the chair, were thin and
spotted with age. She had been a young woman when the Deluge came. She
had been among the first evacuees to the platforms. She had lived her
entire adult life on the water, and she had never, in Ruth's memory,
spoken about what came before.

Ruth sat in the chair opposite her grandmother and placed the journal
on the table between them.

"I found this," Ruth said.

Evelyn looked at the journal. She did not pick it up. She did not ask
what it was. Her expression did not change. But something behind her
eyes shifted — a movement so small that Ruth, who had spent seventeen
years learning to read her grandmother's face, almost missed it.

"You know," Ruth said. It was not a question.

Evelyn was quiet for a long time. The water moved outside the window,
gray-green and constant. A recycling barge passed, its engines humming.

"Yes," Evelyn said. "I know."

"How long have you known?"

"Since the beginning. Since before the platforms. I worked in the
administrative office of the Consortium. I was twenty years old. I filed
the documents. I typed the memoranda. I made the coffee for the meetings
where they decided to end the world." Her voice was steady. Flat. The
voice of a woman who had carried something heavy for sixty years and
whose muscles had long since adapted to the weight. "I didn't understand
it at the time. I was a secretary. I filed what they gave me and I
didn't ask questions. I didn't understand until afterward — until the
water came, and I was on the platform, and I looked back at the
coastline and watched it disappear. And then I understood."

"Why didn't you tell anyone?"

Evelyn looked at her granddaughter with an expression that Ruth had
never seen before. It was not the calm, distant expression that Evelyn
wore like a mask. It was raw. Tired. Old in a way that had nothing to
do with years.

"Because they were right," Evelyn said.

Ruth stared at her.

"I have spent sixty years thinking about it," Evelyn said. "Sixty years,
Ruth. Every day. Every night. I have turned it over and over in my mind
the way you turn a stone in your hand, looking for a crack, looking for
a flaw, looking for the place where the reasoning breaks. And I cannot
find it."

"They killed billions of people."

"Yes."

"Deliberately."

"Yes."

"And you're telling me they were right?"

Evelyn closed her eyes. When she opened them, they were wet.

"I am telling you that the alternative was worse. I am telling you that
the models were correct — that the slow collapse would have been more
destructive than the fast one. That the wars and the famines and the
chaos would have killed more people, over a longer period, with more
suffering, than the Deluge did. I am telling you that the people who
made the decision were not monsters. They were people. Good people.
People who could not sleep, who could not eat, who wept in the hallways
and vomited in the bathrooms and signed the orders anyway because they
believed — I believe — that it was the only choice that led to survival."

"Survival for ten million people out of eleven billion."

"Survival for the species."

The room was quiet. The water moved outside. The barge had passed, and
the sound of its engines faded into the constant, underlying murmur of
the sea.

"Ruth," Evelyn said. "I am going to tell you something, and I want you
to hear it, even if you cannot accept it today. The people who made this
decision carried it for the rest of their lives. Every one of them. Dr.
Moller — the one who wrote that journal — he never recovered. He spent
his last years sitting in a room not unlike this one, looking at the
water, and he did not speak. Not because he couldn't. Because there was
nothing left to say."

"That's not justice."

"No. It is not justice. There is no justice for what was done. There is
no punishment proportionate to the drowning of a world. There is only
the question of whether the world that was built on the water — this
world, our world, the world you were born into — is worth the price that
was paid for it."

Ruth looked at the journal on the table between them. The leather cover
was worn. The pages were yellowed. The words inside described the end
of the world, and the words were written in the small, neat handwriting
of a man who had helped end it.

"Is it?" Ruth asked. "Is it worth the price?"

Evelyn looked out the window at the water.

"I don't know," she said. "I have been asking that question for sixty
years, and I don't know."


                               VII.

Ruth took the journal to the Platform Council.

She did not ask permission. She did not file a request through the
educational office. She walked into the Council chamber during open
session — a weekly meeting where any resident could bring a concern to
the Council's attention — and she placed the journal on the table in
front of Councillor Pratt, who chaired the session, and she said, "I
want to know why this is not in the Archive."

Pratt was a heavy man with gray hair and the manner of someone who had
spent decades managing other people's problems and who was not entirely
sorry that he was approaching retirement. He picked up the journal,
opened it, read the first page, and closed it. His face did not change.

"Where did you get this?" he asked.

"It was in a donation to the school library. Henrik Moller's estate."

"Henrik." Pratt set the journal down. "He was supposed to destroy it."

"He didn't."

"No." Pratt looked at Ruth. The other Council members — five of them,
seated along the curved table — were watching with expressions that
ranged from concern to resignation. None of them looked surprised.

"You all know," Ruth said. "Every one of you."

"The Council has always known," Pratt said. "The information is
classified under Resolution 7. It has been classified since the founding
of the platform system."

"Why?"

Pratt leaned back in his chair. He looked tired. Not the tiredness of
a long day but the tiredness of a long argument, repeated over decades,
that never reached a conclusion.

"Because we decided — the first Council decided, sixty years ago — that
the truth would destroy us. Not physically. Psychologically. Morally.
We were ten million people on forty-seven platforms, surrounded by the
evidence of what had been done. We were traumatized. We were grieving.
And we were trying to build a new civilization from nothing. The Council
believed — and every Council since has agreed — that the burden of
knowing the Deluge was deliberate would be too great. That it would
poison the new world before it had a chance to grow."

"So you lied."

"We omitted. The climate change was real. The sea level rise was real.
We simply did not mention that it was accelerated. We let the natural
process serve as the explanation. It was true, in its essentials. The
world was warming. The ice was melting. The seas were rising. We simply...
did not correct the timeline."

"You lied," Ruth said again. "And you're still lying. To everyone. To
every child in every school on every platform."

Pratt did not argue. He sat in his chair, heavy and tired, and he did
not argue.

"What do you want, Ruth?" he asked.

"I want the truth in the Archive. Open. Accessible. I want people to
know what was done."

"And then what?"

"What do you mean, 'and then what?'"

"I mean: what happens after? When six thousand people on this platform —
and the populations of forty-six other platforms — learn that their
grandparents' generation deliberately drowned the world? What happens
to the social order? To the trust between the generations? To the
moral foundation of everything we've built?"

Ruth opened her mouth and found that she did not have an answer.

"That," Pratt said quietly, "is why it's classified."


                               VIII.

Ruth went home. She sat on the balcony of the apartment she shared with
her mother and her grandmother and she looked at the water and she
thought.

She thought about Dr. Moller, writing in his journal with his neat
handwriting, describing the decision to drown the world. She thought
about the people who made that decision — the engineers, the scientists,
the administrators — sitting in their meetings, looking at their models,
calculating the mathematics of catastrophe.

She thought about Councillor Pratt, carrying the secret for decades,
passing it from one Council to the next like a stone too heavy to hold
and too dangerous to drop.

She thought about her grandmother, who had filed the documents and made
the coffee and watched the coastline disappear and had spent sixty years
looking at the water with an expression that Ruth had never been able
to read, and that she could now read perfectly: the expression of a
woman who knew what was under the surface and who could not look away.

She thought about the children in the schools, learning about the
Deluge as a natural disaster, a consequence of human carelessness, a
lesson in humility and resilience. Learning a story that was true in
every detail except the most important one.

And she thought about the water.

The water that was always there. The water that was her world. The water
that stretched in every direction, gray-green and moving, and that did
not end.

The water that someone had put there. On purpose. Because they believed
it was the only way.

Ruth Alder sat on her balcony and looked at the water and made a decision.

She would tell the truth.

Not because the truth was simple. It was not simple. It was the most
complicated thing she had ever encountered — a tangle of good intentions
and terrible consequences, of love for the species and murder of the
world, of calculation and anguish and the impossible mathematics of
choosing who lives and who dies.

Not because the truth would make things better. She did not know whether
it would make things better. It might make things worse. Pratt might be
right that the knowledge would poison the new world. The social order
might fracture. The trust between generations might shatter.

But the silence was poisoning them too. She could see it — had always
been able to see it, without understanding what she was seeing. The
elders' averted eyes. The deflected questions. The careful omissions in
the history lessons. The weight of the secret pressing down on everyone
who carried it, and the absence of the secret pressing down, in a
different way, on everyone who did not.

A civilization built on a lie was a civilization built on water. Sooner
or later, the foundation would give way.

Ruth stood up from her chair. She went inside, where her grandmother
sat by the window, looking out at the water with her old, knowing eyes.

"Grandma," Ruth said.

Evelyn turned.

"I'm going to tell people."

Evelyn looked at her for a long time. The light from the window fell
across her face, and the water moved outside, and the platform hummed
with the sound of six thousand people living their lives on a structure
that floated on the evidence of the greatest decision ever made.

"I know," Evelyn said.

"Are you angry?"

"No." Evelyn reached out and took Ruth's hand. Her fingers were thin
and cool. "I am relieved."

Ruth squeezed her grandmother's hand. Then she went to the terminal
in the kitchen, sat down, and began to write.

She wrote the truth. All of it. The decision. The technology. The
mathematics. The reasons. The cost. She wrote it plainly, in simple
words, because the truth was complicated enough without making the
language complicated too.

She did not add a moral. She did not tell people what to feel. She
wrote what had happened and she let the facts carry their own weight,
because the facts were heavy enough.

When she finished, she sent it to every terminal on every platform in
the network.

Then she went back to the balcony and sat down and looked at the water.

The water was still there. It would always be there. The water did not
care about the truth or the lie or the decision or the cost. The water
simply was.

But the people floating on it deserved to know how it got there.

                              [THE END]

================================================================================

                      SHAPE OF HER ABSENCE

                       by Miriam Blackwell

================================================================================

                               I.

The body remembers what the mind refuses to process, and Kira Vasquez
felt Earth's gravity as an accusation.

Seventeen months in deep space — solo, the Hermes IV probe tender, a
mission profile that the psych evaluators had approved with notations she
was not permitted to read but whose tenor she could guess — and now the
weight of a world pressing into her bones, her joints, the soft tissue
between her vertebrae, as though the planet were making up for lost time.
Everything was heavy. Her arms were heavy. Her thoughts were heavy. The
air itself had a density that seemed personal, as though it had been
waiting for her and intended to make its presence felt.

She stood in the arrivals processing center at Edwards, in the white-
walled institutional space where returning astronauts were debriefed and
examined and gradually reintroduced to the fact of Earth, and she felt
the absence of Lena the way one feels a phantom limb: the nerves still
firing, the brain still sending signals to a part of the body that is
no longer there.

Lena was not dead. This was important. Kira repeated it to herself with
the deliberateness of a mantra, a cognitive exercise she had developed
during the long outbound transit when the light-speed delay made
communication with Earth an exercise in patience and the messages from
Lena had begun to change in ways that Kira could not, at first, identify.

Lena was not dead. She was simply no longer the person Kira had left.


                               II.

They had met four years ago — though the word "ago" had become
complicated, because Kira's seventeen months in space were not the
same as Earth's seventeen months, and this asymmetry was at the center
of everything — at a reception for the Hermes program at JPL, where
Lena was working as a neuroscience postdoc studying the effects of
long-duration spaceflight on cognitive function. She was one of the
people whose job it was to determine whether Kira's brain would survive
the mission, and the fact that she was also the person whose presence
made Kira's brain feel most vividly alive was a coincidence that both
of them found amusing and neither of them found sufficient reason for
caution.

Lena Chen was thirty-one then — small, precise in her movements, with
dark eyes that held a quality of focused attention that Kira would later
recognize as the way Lena looked at everything she considered important.
She looked at brain scans that way. She looked at data that way. She
looked at Kira that way. The intensity was not aggressive — it was
intimate. The gaze of someone who wanted to understand, genuinely and
completely, what she was seeing.

They had two years together before the mission. Two years that Kira,
during the long empty months of the outbound transit, would inventory
with the obsessive precision of a miser counting coins: the apartment
in Pasadena with the jacaranda tree outside the bedroom window. The
morning coffee ritual — Lena brewed it too strong, always, and Kira
drank it without complaint, always, because the taste had become
inseparable from the fact of Lena. The arguments about the mission,
which were not really arguments but a single ongoing negotiation
between Lena's fear and Kira's need, conducted with the careful
honesty of two people who understood that they were asking each other
to accept something that could not be made acceptable.

"Seventeen months," Lena had said, lying beside Kira in the dark of
the apartment, the jacaranda's shadow moving on the ceiling. "Seventeen
months alone in a tin can, and I'm supposed to just wait."

"You're not supposed to do anything. You can do whatever you need to do."

"What I need is for you not to go."

"I know."

"But you're going."

"I'm going."

Lena had been quiet for a long time. Then she had said, "There's a
trial. A clinical trial at Caltech. Temporal perception modification.
It's — they've developed a way to accelerate subjective time perception.
Pharmacological, with a neural interface component. The subject
experiences time at an accelerated rate — months compressed into weeks.
The body ages normally, but the subjective experience of duration is
shortened."

Kira had propped herself up on one elbow. "You want to speed up time
so the wait feels shorter?"

"I want to not spend seventeen months in agony. Yes."

"Lena — "

"I know. I know the risks. I've read every paper. I've talked to the
research team. The side effects are manageable. The subjective
acceleration is reversible. And the alternative is seventeen months of
waiting for you to come back, knowing that every day for me is a day
for you too, except you're out there and I'm here and there's nothing
I can do but sit in this apartment and count the days."

"The alternative is living through it. The way people have always lived
through it."

"People have always had the option of suffering. That doesn't make it
a virtue."

They had argued about it — gently, repeatedly, over the course of the
six weeks before Kira's departure — and Kira had not been able to
articulate, even to herself, the source of her objection. The treatment
was safe, or safe enough. The research was sound. The consent was
informed. And Lena was an adult, a scientist, a person fully capable of
making decisions about her own consciousness.

But something in Kira resisted. Something that had to do with the idea
that they would not be experiencing the separation together — that
Kira would live through every minute of the seventeen months while Lena
compressed them into something shorter, lighter, more bearable. That
Kira would carry the full weight of the time and Lena would carry a
fraction of it, and that this disparity — this asymmetry of suffering —
would create a gap between them that neither distance nor technology
could bridge.

She had not said this. She had said, "I love you, and I want you to do
what you need to do," and Lena had enrolled in the trial the week
before Kira launched.


                               III.

The outbound transit took five months. Five months in the Hermes IV —
a vessel designed for function rather than comfort, a cylinder of metal
and polymer that was her home and her workplace and her universe,
populated by instruments and systems that were her responsibility and
by the silence that was nobody's responsibility but pressed in on her
nonetheless.

She had known it would be hard. The psych evaluators had told her it
would be hard, in the careful, clinical language of people whose job
it is to prepare you for an experience they have never had. Long-
duration solo spaceflight, they said, produced predictable psychological
effects: isolation, time distortion, alterations in self-perception,
a phenomenon they called "detachment syndrome" in which the subject
began to experience their own life as observed rather than lived. Kira
had nodded and signed the forms and launched into the black and
discovered, within the first month, that the clinical language was not
wrong but was utterly inadequate, the way a map of a desert is not wrong
but does not convey the heat.

The hardest part was the messages from Lena.

They came with a light-speed delay that increased as Kira moved farther
from Earth — minutes at first, then an hour, then several hours. Each
message was a recording, Lena's face on the screen, her voice carrying
across the void with the intimacy of a whisper and the delay of a
memory. In the early weeks, the messages were dense with detail — Lena
described her days, her work, her feelings, the progress of the clinical
trial, the jacaranda tree blooming outside the window that they had
shared. She spoke the way she always spoke: precisely, completely, with
the focused attention that was her way of saying I am here and I see you
and you matter.

But as the weeks passed, the messages changed.

Not in content, exactly — Lena still described her days, still reported
on the trial, still said the words that lovers say across the distance.
But the rhythm changed. The density thinned. The messages became shorter,
more summary, as though Lena were describing her life from a greater
altitude — seeing the shape of it rather than the texture. She spoke of
weeks the way she had once spoken of days. She mentioned events that
Kira could not place in the timeline because Lena had skipped over the
days that connected them.

The treatment was working. Lena's subjective experience of time was
accelerating. The seventeen months that Kira was living minute by
minute — each one felt, each one heavy, each one a small unit of
distance between her and the person she loved — were compressing for
Lena into something shorter. Something more manageable. Something that
did not hurt as much.

Kira should have been glad. She should have been grateful that Lena
was not suffering. Instead, she felt — she had to find the word for it,
sitting alone in the Hermes IV, listening to a message from a woman
whose experience of time was diverging from hers like two roads leaving
the same intersection — she felt abandoned. Not by Lena's choice, which
she understood. Not by Lena's absence, which she had accepted. But by
Lena's time. By the fact that the months that Kira was enduring — really
enduring, in the full, uncompressed, minute-by-minute weight of their
duration — were not being endured by Lena. That Kira was carrying the
time alone.

This was irrational. She knew it was irrational. Love does not require
simultaneous suffering. Devotion is not measured in hours of pain. But
the feeling was there, irrational and persistent, and it grew as the
messages from Lena became shorter and more compressed and more distant,
as though Lena were receding not across space but across time itself,
moving through her months at a pace that left Kira behind.


                               IV.

The mission itself — the servicing of the Hermes probe array at the
edge of the outer system — was fourteen weeks of concentrated technical
work that Kira performed with the focused competence that was her
professional mode and that was, she recognized, also her survival
strategy. When she was working, she was not thinking about Lena. When
she was running diagnostics and replacing components and calibrating
instruments, the time passed at the pace it passed, and the weight of
it was distributed across tasks rather than concentrated in the hollow
space between messages.

She was good at the work. She had always been good at work — at the
absorption of herself in process, the subordination of feeling to
function. It was why the psych evaluators had selected her: she had the
capacity to set herself aside, to become an instrument in the service
of a task, and to do this for months without breaking.

What she could not do — what the psych evaluators had not tested for,
because it was not the kind of thing that showed up on an evaluation
— was set aside the growing awareness that the woman she loved was
living at a different speed. That Lena's experience of the separation
was fundamentally unlike her own. That when Kira returned to Earth,
she would have lived through seventeen months of solitude, fear, and
longing, and Lena would have lived through — what? Six months? Four?
The treatment's acceleration rate was variable, and Lena's messages
had become too compressed to calculate.

The asymmetry was the thing. Not the distance — distance was a
solvable problem, a function of velocity and time. But the asymmetry
of experience was something else. It was a gap in the shared reality
of their relationship, and Kira did not know how to bridge it, because
you cannot bridge a gap that exists in time itself.

During the return transit, the messages from Lena became longer again.
The treatment was being tapered. Lena's subjective time was decelerating,
returning to its normal rate. Her messages regained their density, their
texture, their moment-by-moment presence. She described the return to
normal time with the disorientation of a traveler returning from a
foreign country — the familiar world strange, the mundane details vivid
and overwhelming.

"It's like waking up," Lena said, in a message that reached Kira three
hours after it was sent. "Like I've been asleep, and the world has been
going on without me, and now I'm back and everything is so... present.
So detailed. So slow." She paused, and her face on the screen held an
expression that Kira could not read. "I missed you. I want you to know
that. I missed you the whole time. But the missing was — different.
Smaller. More manageable. Like a photograph of missing instead of the
thing itself."

Kira listened to this message and replayed it and listened again and
tried to find the words for what she felt and could not find them.

A photograph of missing. Instead of the thing itself.


                               V.

They met at Edwards, in the arrivals processing center, seventeen days
after Kira's reentry. The debriefing and medical evaluation had taken
that long — seventeen days of tests and interviews and the slow
readjustment of a body that had spent seventeen months in low gravity
and a mind that had spent seventeen months in solitude.

Lena was standing in the visitor area, beyond the glass partition, and
Kira saw her before Lena saw Kira, and in that moment — the moment
before recognition, before the performance of reunion, before the
embrace and the tears and the words that would be inadequate —
Kira studied Lena's face and saw that it was the same face and not
the same face.

Lena looked the same. Physically, she looked exactly the same — the
same dark hair, the same precise features, the same small frame. She
was wearing a jacket that Kira recognized and earrings that Kira did
not recognize and shoes that were new, and these small details —
the familiar and the unfamiliar, layered together — produced a
dissonance that Kira felt in her chest like a wrong note in a
familiar song.

Then Lena saw her, and her face changed — opened, broke, reassembled
itself around the fact of Kira's presence — and they were through the
partition and holding each other and Kira felt Lena's body against hers,
warm and real and present, and for a moment the asymmetry did not matter.

For a moment.


                               VI.

The apartment in Pasadena was the same and not the same. The jacaranda
tree had been trimmed. The furniture had been rearranged — subtly, a
chair moved, a table turned. There were new books on the shelf, books
Kira had not seen, evidence of a life that had continued in her absence
at a pace she could not share.

They settled back into the routines of shared life with the careful
attentiveness of people reassembling something fragile, handling each
moment with the awareness that it could break. They cooked together.
They slept together. They talked — about the mission, about the trial,
about the seventeen months that they had experienced separately and
differently and that they were now trying, with increasing difficulty,
to reconcile.

The difficulty was in the details.

Kira would describe a moment from the mission — a particular day, a
specific difficulty, a feeling that had lasted for weeks — and she would
see in Lena's eyes the effort of translation, the attempt to map Kira's
experience onto her own compressed timeline. "That was around month
eight?" Lena would ask, and Kira would say yes, and Lena would nod, and
there would be a silence in which both of them understood that month
eight, for Kira, had been a specific and terrible month, and that for
Lena, month eight had been a blur — a section of compressed time that
she had moved through at a pace that left no room for the kind of
detail that Kira had lived in.

It was not that Lena did not care. She cared enormously. She asked
questions, she listened, she held Kira in the dark when the nightmares
came — and the nightmares did come, because seventeen months of
solitude does not end when the solitude does; it echoes, the way a bell
echoes after it has been struck. Lena was present and attentive and
loving, and none of it was enough, because the gap was not in the caring.
The gap was in the experience. The gap was in the fact that Kira had
lived through something that Lena had not.

"I was there," Lena said, one evening, when the conversation had
circled back — as it always circled back — to the asymmetry. "I was
on Earth, waiting for you, thinking about you, missing you. I was
there."

"You were there at a different speed."

"I was there."

"You were there the way a photograph of a person is there. Present but
not living. A representation of being there, not the thing itself."

Lena flinched. Kira had not intended the words to wound — they had come
from a place inside her that was not strategic but honest, the place
where feelings exist before they are processed into kindness — and she
reached for Lena's hand and said, "I'm sorry. That was unfair."

"It was unfair. It was also what you feel."

"Yes."

"Then say it. Don't protect me from it. Say what you feel."

Kira looked at Lena — at this woman she loved, this woman who had
chosen to compress her suffering into a manageable package while Kira
carried hers at full weight — and she said the thing she had not been
able to say.

"I feel like I waited for you and you didn't wait for me."

The sentence hung in the air between them, dense and irreducible.

Lena did not cry. She did not argue. She sat very still, the way she
sat when she was processing something complex — a brain scan, a data
set, a truth she did not want to see — and then she said, "I know."

"You know?"

"I knew before you came back. I knew the moment the treatment started
to taper and normal time returned and I felt — for the first time in
months — the actual weight of your absence. The full weight. Not the
compressed version. The real thing. And I understood what I had done."

She paused.

"I had made the waiting bearable. And in making it bearable, I had
made it something other than waiting. Something lighter. Something
less. And you" — her voice caught, the first break in its steadiness
— "you had carried the real thing. The full, uncompressed, terrible
thing. And I hadn't."

"No," Kira said. "You hadn't."

They sat in the apartment in Pasadena, in the evening light, with the
shadow of the jacaranda on the wall, and between them was the gap that
neither distance nor presence could close: the gap between two versions
of the same seventeen months, one lived at full speed and one compressed,
one endured and one managed, one carrying the weight of every minute and
one carrying a photograph of the weight.


                               VII.

It would be convenient to say that they found a way through. That love,
being larger than time, transcended the asymmetry. That the gap closed
as the months passed and new shared experience accumulated on top of
the old divergent experience, burying it under the sediment of daily
life.

But Kira was not a person who found convenience in untruth, and the
truth was more complicated.

The gap did not close. But it changed. It changed the way a wound
changes — not by disappearing but by becoming part of the body's
landscape, incorporated into the flesh, present but no longer acute.
They learned to live with it the way people learn to live with all the
asymmetries of love: the fact that no two people experience the same
relationship, that what one person gives is not what the other receives,
that the space between two hearts is never zero and is never the same
distance measured from both sides.

Kira went back to work. Lena went back to the lab. They rebuilt the
routines of shared life — the morning coffee, the evening meals, the
conversations that were both easier and harder than they had been
before, because they now knew something about each other that they had
not known before, which was this: that love does not require equal
suffering, but it notices the inequality.

On a night in October — eleven months after Kira's return, in the
apartment with the jacaranda tree whose leaves were turning yellow in
the autumn light — Lena said, "If I could do it over, I would not take
the treatment."

Kira looked at her. "Why?"

"Because the waiting was the point. The suffering was the point. Not
because suffering is good — it isn't, and I won't pretend it is. But
because it was the thing we were supposed to share. The only thing we
could share, across that distance. And I gave up my half of it."

Kira thought about this. She thought about the seventeen months — the
real months, the heavy months, the months that she had lived minute
by minute in the silence of the Hermes IV. She thought about the
weight of that time, and she thought about what it would have meant
to know that Lena was carrying an equal weight, on the other end of
the distance, in the apartment with the jacaranda tree.

"It wouldn't have been the same," Kira said. "Even without the
treatment. Your seventeen months would not have been my seventeen months.
You would have been on Earth, in the world, with people and sunlight
and gravity. I would have been alone. The experience would have been
different no matter what."

"But it would have been simultaneous."

"Yes. It would have been simultaneous."

"And that matters."

"Yes," Kira said. "That matters."

They were quiet for a long time. The jacaranda's shadow moved on the
wall. The sound of the city came through the open window — traffic,
voices, the ten thousand small sounds of a world going about its
business, indifferent to the private negotiations of two people trying
to find their way back to each other across a gap that existed not in
space but in time.

"I'm here now," Lena said.

"I know."

"At normal speed. Full weight. Every minute."

"I know."

"Is that enough?"

Kira looked at the woman she loved — at Lena's dark eyes, her precise
features, her small hands resting on the table between them. She looked
at this woman who had tried to make the waiting bearable and who had
learned, too late, that bearable was not the same as shared. Who had
compressed her grief into a manageable package and discovered that the
package was lighter than love required.

"I don't know," Kira said. And then, because honesty without tenderness
is just cruelty, and because she had learned this in seventeen months
of solitude if she had learned nothing else: "But I want to find out."

Lena's hand moved across the table and found Kira's, and they sat in
the evening light, in the apartment with the jacaranda, and the minutes
passed at the same speed for both of them, and each minute was heavy,
and each minute was real.

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

CASSANDRA VOSS spent eleven years as a political analyst at the State
Department before turning to fiction. Her first story for "Tales," "The
Attache's Dilemma," appeared in Issue #51 and was immediately recognized
as a new kind of political science fiction — one grounded not in the
theatrics of galactic empire but in the real mechanics of diplomacy,
negotiation, and compromise. She lives in Georgetown and describes her
writing as "an attempt to take politics seriously and politicians even
more seriously." "Dialectic of Stars" is her second appearance in these
pages, and it confirms what her first suggested: that she is one of the
most important new voices in the field.

THEODORE CAIN has appeared in nearly every issue of this magazine since
its founding in 1953 — an extraordinary record of consistency and
craftsmanship that we are in danger of taking for granted. A former
assembly-line worker and technical writer from Detroit, Cain brings to
his fiction the values of competence, reliability, and the dignity of
work. "Meridian" is his forty-seventh story for these pages, and it
represents, in the editors' view, some of his finest and most thoughtful
work. He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean, and continues
to write every evening from eight to midnight.

ELAINE PRESCOTT makes her debut in these pages with "Scalpel and Soma,"
and we are pleased to be the first to introduce her to the reading
public. A graduate of MIT in electrical engineering with a specialty in
cybernetics, Prescott currently works at Draper Laboratory in Cambridge.
Her fiction draws on her technical expertise to explore the boundary
between the human body and its technological extensions — a subject she
approaches with clinical precision and, as this story demonstrates,
considerable moral seriousness. We expect to hear a great deal more from
her. Readers who admire the work of Arthur Wainwright in the field of
artificial intelligence will find in Prescott a comparable talent applied
to the even more intimate question of what happens when the machine is
inside the person rather than beside them.

LUCIAN MARSH has been contributing his distinctive brand of atmospheric
horror to these pages since Issue #11, and "Seventh Son" is among his
most unusual stories — a departure from his characteristic deep-space
settings into the equally unsettling territory of colonial folklore. Marsh
lives on the Massachusetts coast and communicates with the editorial
office exclusively by letter, which we mention not as eccentricity but
as a point of information for readers who may wish to write to him: care
of this magazine will reach him, in time. His story collection, "The
Bathyscaphe and Other Descents," is available from Constellation Press.

AGNES WHITFIELD farms wheat in central Kansas when she is not writing
some of the most quietly devastating fiction in the science fiction
field. Her stories of survival and rebuilding after catastrophe have been
a feature of this magazine since Issue #13, and "After the Deluge"
continues her exploration of the human capacity to endure the
unendurable. She writes at the kitchen table between chores, and her
prose has the spare, honest quality of a woman who knows that the most
important things do not require fancy language. Her husband Lloyd assists
with the proofreading.

MIRIAM BLACKWELL is a former clinical psychologist turned writer whose
fiction explores the interior landscape of consciousness with the depth
and rigor of a scientific investigation and the beauty of a poem. She
joined these pages with "The Interior Astronaut" in Issue #50 and has
since established herself as one of the most original voices in
psychological science fiction. She lives in Greenwich Village, maintains
a meditation practice, and describes her writing as "inner-space
exploration." "Shape of Her Absence" is a love story — of a kind that
only Blackwell could write.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling and Miss Foxworth,

Cassandra Voss's "The Attache's Dilemma" in your May issue was the first
science fiction story I have read that accurately represents the
experience of diplomatic negotiation. As a retired Foreign Service
officer, I can attest that the business of interstellar diplomacy, should
it ever come to pass, will look far more like Mrs. Voss's story than
like the shoot-first-negotiate-never approach favored by most writers in
your field. I eagerly anticipate her next contribution.

                              — Ambassador (ret.) Harold Keane
                                 Washington, D.C.

Dear Editors,

I wish to register a respectful but firm objection to Miriam Blackwell's
"The Interior Astronaut" (Issue #50). While I acknowledge that the
writing is technically accomplished, the story contains no spaceships,
no aliens, no advanced technology, and no discernible plot. What it does
contain is approximately twelve thousand words of a woman sitting in a
bathtub thinking about her feelings. I subscribe to this magazine for
science fiction. If I wanted to read about feelings, I would subscribe
to the Ladies' Home Journal.

                              — Edgar Potts
                                 Dayton, Ohio

Ed — We appreciate the candor. However, we respectfully suggest that the
sensory deprivation tank in Blackwell's story is as much a piece of
speculative technology as any rocket, and that the interior of the human
mind is as legitimate a frontier as the surface of Mars. But we hear
you, and we promise: there will be spaceships.              — M.S. & D.F.

Dear Sterling and Foxworth,

Theodore Cain's "The Long Haul" in your July issue was his best story
in years — possibly his best ever. The scene where the crew realizes
that the alien vessel is not a derelict but a nursery is one of those
moments that reminds you why you read science fiction in the first
place. Cain does not get enough credit. He is the foundation this
magazine is built on, and I hope you know it.

                              — James Morrow
                                 Evanston, Illinois

We know it. We have always known it.                        — M.S. & D.F.

Dear Editors,

I am a student of political science at Columbia University, and I am
writing to say that Cassandra Voss's work in your magazine is being
discussed in my department with a seriousness that is not typically
accorded to genre fiction. Professor Whitfield (no relation, as far as I
know, to your Kansas contributor) has assigned "The Attache's Dilemma"
as supplementary reading in his course on international negotiation. I
thought you and Mrs. Voss would like to know.

                              — Patricia Hume
                                 New York, N.Y.

We like to know. We like it very much.                      — M.S. & D.F.

================================================================================

THE WHOLE MAN by John Brunner
(Ballantine Books, 1964, $0.50)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Brunner has produced a novel of remarkable ambition and uneven
execution. Gerald Dowen is born deformed, impoverished, and telepathic
— a combination that makes him both the most powerful mind on Earth and
the most marginalized. The novel traces his journey from outcast to
healer, and its best passages — particularly the telepathic "rescue
missions" in which Dowen enters the shattered psyches of disturbed
individuals — are genuinely extraordinary, the kind of writing that
makes you forget you are reading fiction and convinces you that you are
experiencing another consciousness from the inside. The weaker sections
are those dealing with political intrigue, which feel conventional by
comparison. Nevertheless, this is an important book, and one that takes
the interior landscape seriously as a setting for science fiction.
Recommended.

MARTIAN TIME-SLIP by Philip K. Dick
(Ballantine Books, 1964, $0.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Dick is that rarest of creatures: a writer who is both deeply
strange and deeply accessible. His latest novel is set on a colonized
Mars that is part frontier settlement, part failed suburb, and entirely
haunted by the question of what is real. The plot — involving a repairman,
an autistic child who can see the future, a corrupt union boss, and
the native Bleekmen whose perception of time is not like ours — is
simultaneously a satire of suburban California, a meditation on mental
illness, and a horror story about the entropy that devours all human
enterprise. It should not work. It works beautifully. Mr. Dick writes
like a man who has seen something terrible and must tell you about it
before it fades, and his urgency is infectious. Highly recommended, with
the caveat that readers who require their science fiction to be
reassuring should look elsewhere.

GREYBEARD by Brian Aldiss
(Harcourt, Brace & World, 1964, $4.50)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Aldiss has written a quiet, melancholy, and ultimately hopeful novel
about the end of human fertility. In a world where no children have been
born for decades, an aging population drifts through a depopulating
England that is slowly being reclaimed by nature. There are no villains,
no dramatic confrontations, no desperate last-minute solutions. There is
only the slow, sad, beautiful process of a species coming to terms with
its own extinction — and, in the novel's final pages, a development that
I shall not reveal but that moved me to tears. Mr. Aldiss is one of the
most humane writers in our field, and this is his most humane book.
Strongly recommended.
