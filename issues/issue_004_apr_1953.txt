              TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
                     by Maxwell Sterling
================================================================================

Dear Readers,

I will confess something to you, though it may cost me what remains of my
editorial dignity: when the stories for this issue began arriving on my desk,
I laughed so hard that my secretary, Mrs. Hoffman, came rushing in to check
whether I was having some manner of seizure. I was not. I was reading Douglas
Pemberton's account of an illegal fried egg, and I dare you -- I double-dare
you, as the children say -- to read it without at least one involuntary snort.

This is, I declare without reservation, our funniest issue yet.

But here is the thing about humor in science fiction, and I suspect you already
know it: the laughter comes with teeth. Pemberton's egg is funny until you
realize he is writing about a world that has optimized the joy out of living.
Phyllis Crenshaw's time-travel romp is a delight until you notice that her
hero's every clever maneuver only tightens the noose of inevitability. Even
Colonel Stanton -- our stalwart man of military letters -- delivers a punchline
that doubles as a commentary on the absurdity of mutual annihilation.

We have not abandoned the serious this month, mind you. Father Aquino returns
with a meditation on faith and emptiness that left me staring at my office
ceiling for the better part of an afternoon. Arthur Wainwright poses a question
about beauty and consciousness that I suspect will haunt the letters column for
months. Theodore Cain, a welcome new voice, gives us prospectors on Europa who
discover that mining rights and moral rights are not the same thing. And
Cordell Beaumont -- well, Beaumont paints alien landscapes the way Rembrandt
painted light, and his Valeria is a world I would very much like to visit, tidal
catastrophes notwithstanding.

The sharp-eyed among you will notice that this issue runs a few pages longer
than usual. I fought our publisher, Mr. Hargrove, for every one of them. He
suggested cuts. I suggested he read the stories first. He did. The pages stayed.

I believe science fiction is at its most vital when it refuses to choose between
entertaining and provoking, when it makes you laugh and then makes you wonder
what, exactly, you were laughing at. This issue does precisely that, and I am
proud of every page.

So brew your coffee (while it is still legal -- read Pemberton and shudder),
settle into your chair, and enjoy our April offering. The future, it turns out,
is hilarious. Until it isn't.

See you among the stars,
Maxwell Sterling

                    ILLEGAL EGG
                       by Douglas Pemberton
================================================================================

It is a truth universally acknowledged that a retired schoolteacher in
possession of a good appetite must be in want of an egg.

Mrs. Edith Plimpton -- seventy-three years of age, four feet eleven inches of
concentrated moral certainty, and the former terror of Jefferson Elementary
School's third-grade class for a span of forty-one years -- desired an egg
on the morning of March 14th, 2075, with a passion that would not be denied.
This was, as events would shortly demonstrate, a matter of some consequence.

The difficulty, you see, was that eggs were illegal.

Not merely discouraged, not subject to a modest surcharge, not wrapped in the
sort of cautionary labeling that might give a reasonable citizen pause. Illegal.
Prohibited. Banned. Verboten. The World Nutrition Authority -- that gleaming
colossus of dietary righteousness whose chrome headquarters dominated the Geneva
skyline like an enormous vitamin supplement -- had, in the year 2061, issued
Directive 7,412, which classified the chicken egg as a Class 3 Nutritional
Hazard, on par with refined sugar, partially hydrogenated oils, and the memory
of birthday cake.

Mrs. Plimpton had never cared for directives.

She had survived directives throughout her teaching career -- the Curriculum
Standardization Act of 2038, the Mandatory Joy Initiative of 2045, the
frankly bewildering Regulation of Classroom Emotions (Subsection 12: Permitted
Frowns) -- and she had survived them by the simple expedient of closing her
classroom door and doing precisely as she pleased. Her students had learned
their multiplication tables. They had also learned, by Mrs. Plimpton's
sterling example, that there were occasions in life when the proper response
to a rule was a polite but unwavering refusal to acknowledge its existence.

The egg in question had come from a chicken named Margaret, who resided in
what Mrs. Plimpton described as a "decorative bird enclosure" in her small
backyard in Westfield, New Jersey, and what the World Nutrition Authority
would later describe, in formal legal proceedings, as an "unlicensed protein
manufacturing facility." Margaret was a Rhode Island Red of considerable
dignity and regular habits. She produced one egg per day, and Mrs. Plimpton
ate it.

On the morning in question, Mrs. Plimpton rose at six o'clock, as was her
custom. She donned her housecoat -- the blue one with the embroidered daisies,
which she had owned since 2049 and which had achieved the comfortable
shapelessness that only decades of faithful service can produce. She
descended to the kitchen. She retrieved Margaret's daily offering from the
backyard. She placed a small quantity of butter -- also illegal, but Mrs.
Plimpton had long since ceased to keep count of her infractions -- in a
cast-iron skillet that had belonged to her mother. She ignited the stove.

And then she cracked the egg.

It was at precisely this moment that Nutrition Compliance Officer Bradley
Finch, badge number 4471, who had been conducting routine aerial surveillance
of the Westfield residential district via the Authority's network of dietary
monitoring drones, detected an unauthorized thermal signature consistent with
the preparation of a proscribed food item.

Officer Finch was twenty-six years old. He had graduated third in his class
from the World Nutrition Authority Academy. He had a commendation for
Outstanding Caloric Vigilance. He had never, in his life, tasted a fried egg,
and he approached Mrs. Plimpton's front door with the righteous certainty of
a man who has never once questioned whether the thing he is doing is
fundamentally absurd.

"Ma'am," said Officer Finch, when Mrs. Plimpton opened the door, "I have
reason to believe you are in violation of Directive 7,412, Subsection C,
Paragraph 19, regarding the preparation and consumption of a Class 3
Nutritional Hazard."

Mrs. Plimpton regarded him over the tops of her spectacles. It was the same
look she had given generations of eight-year-olds who had attempted to
convince her that the dog had eaten their homework, and its effect on Officer
Finch was immediate and devastating. He took a small, involuntary step
backward.

"Young man," said Mrs. Plimpton, "my egg is getting cold."

"Ma'am, I'm going to need to confiscate --"

"You are going to need to wipe your feet if you intend to enter my house.
Were you raised in a barn?"

"Ma'am --"

"I said wipe your feet."

Officer Finch wiped his feet. He was not proud of this, and he would later
omit it from his official report, but he did it. There are forces in the
universe against which the authority of a compliance badge is simply
inadequate, and Mrs. Edith Plimpton was one of them.

He entered the kitchen. He observed the egg. It sat in the cast-iron skillet,
its yolk a magnificent and defiant orange, its edges crisped to that perfect
lacework of brown that distinguishes a properly fried egg from all lesser
achievements of the culinary arts. The butter -- the illegal butter --
sizzled around it like applause.

"Ma'am, I am placing you under nutritional arrest."

"Oh, piffle," said Mrs. Plimpton. She turned off the stove, slid the egg
onto a plate, and sat down at her kitchen table. She picked up her fork.

"Ma'am, if you consume that egg, you will be adding a charge of Willful
Ingestion to --"

Mrs. Plimpton ate the egg. She ate it with the methodical satisfaction of a
woman who has been eating eggs for seventy-three years and does not intend to
stop because a young man with a badge and an insufficient understanding of
what constitutes a genuine threat to public welfare has appeared in her
kitchen before she has finished her breakfast.

"Delicious," she said.

Officer Finch, to his credit, filed a thorough report.

                              * * *

The trial of Mrs. Edith Plimpton (World Nutrition Authority v. Plimpton,
Case No. 2075-NCA-8814) commenced six weeks later in the District Nutrition
Court of Newark, New Jersey, before the Honorable Judge Franklin DeSoto, a
man of considerable girth who had, in the privacy of his own chambers and
the secrecy of his own heart, been dreaming about cheeseburgers for the
better part of a decade.

The prosecution was handled by Assistant Director of Nutritional Compliance
Victoria Steele, a woman whose relationship with food was best described as
adversarial. She was forty-four, angular, and sustained primarily by
Authority-Approved Nutrient Paste (Flavor: Efficiency), which she consumed
from a tube at precisely calculated intervals. She had prosecuted four
hundred and twelve nutritional crimes and had never lost a case. She viewed
Mrs. Plimpton the way a surgeon might view an inflamed appendix: a small,
troublesome thing to be removed with clinical precision.

The defense was undertaken by one Harold P. Bumble, Esq., a lawyer of
uncertain reputation and unshakable enthusiasm who had volunteered for the
case after seeing Mrs. Plimpton's story on the evening news feed and
declaring to his wife, over a dinner of Nutrient Paste (Flavor: Alleged
Chicken), that "by God, Maureen, somebody's got to stand up for breakfast."

Bumble was fifty-seven, stout, rumpled, and in possession of a legal mind
that his professors at Columbia had once described as "unconventional" in
the same tone one might use to describe a house fire as "exciting."

"Ladies and gentlemen of the jury," said Victoria Steele, in her opening
statement, "this case is not about an egg."

This was, it would develop, entirely incorrect. The case was almost
exclusively about an egg.

"This case," Steele continued, "is about the rule of law. It is about the
social contract that binds us together as a civilization. It is about the
principle that no individual's appetites may be placed above the collective
well-being of humanity. The defendant, Mrs. Edith Plimpton, did knowingly
and willfully prepare, and subsequently ingest, a chicken egg -- a substance
classified as a Class 3 Nutritional Hazard by the World Nutrition Authority,
a body established by the unanimous consent of 194 nations for the express
purpose of safeguarding human health. She did so in full knowledge of the
law. She has expressed no remorse. She must be held accountable."

Harold Bumble rose. He adjusted his tie, which was crooked. He cleared his
throat. He shuffled his notes, dropped several of them, retrieved them, and
then addressed the jury with the earnest bewilderment of a man who has just
been asked to explain why water is wet.

"Ladies and gentlemen," he said, "it was an egg. She fried it. She ate it.
And now we are all here, in this courtroom, at taxpayer expense, discussing
it." He paused. "Does anyone else find this strange? Because I find this
very strange."

The trial lasted nine days.

The prosecution called fourteen witnesses, including a nutritional
biochemist who testified for six hours on the metabolic dangers of
cholesterol (Judge DeSoto was observed to fall asleep twice during this
testimony, though he later insisted he had merely been "resting his eyes
in a judicial manner"), a sociologist who warned that unsanctioned eating
behaviors posed "an existential threat to the cooperative food framework,"
and Officer Bradley Finch, who recounted his confrontation with Mrs.
Plimpton with the haunted air of a man who has gazed into the abyss and
found it wearing a blue housecoat with embroidered daisies.

The defense called three witnesses. The first was Mrs. Plimpton herself.

"Mrs. Plimpton," said Harold Bumble, "can you describe for the court what
you had for breakfast on the morning in question?"

"An egg," said Mrs. Plimpton.

"And how was it prepared?"

"Fried. In butter. In my mother's skillet. I fail to see why this requires
elaboration."

"Can you tell the court how many eggs you have consumed in your lifetime?"

Victoria Steele objected. "Irrelevant."

"I'll allow it," said Judge DeSoto, who was finding Mrs. Plimpton
considerably more interesting than the biochemist.

Mrs. Plimpton considered the question. "I have eaten an egg for breakfast
nearly every day since I was four years old. I am seventy-three. Accounting
for occasional illness and two weeks in 2031 when I was traveling in Peru
and could not find a decent egg to save my life, I estimate approximately
twenty-five thousand eggs."

A murmur rippled through the courtroom.

"And how is your health, Mrs. Plimpton?"

"Excellent. I have the blood pressure of a woman half my age. I walk two
miles every morning. I have all of my own teeth." She paused. "I also have
my own chicken, but I understand that is a separate legal matter."

The second defense witness was Dr. Alistair Cho, a nutritional historian from
Columbia University, who testified that the chicken egg had been a staple of
human diet for approximately eight thousand years, that no civilization in
recorded history had seen fit to ban it, and that the World Nutrition
Authority's classification system, while well-intentioned, had "perhaps
overcorrected somewhat" in its zeal to optimize human intake.

"Would you say, Dr. Cho, that an egg is dangerous?" asked Bumble.

"I would say," replied Dr. Cho, with the careful precision of an academic
who knows he is being filmed, "that an egg is an egg. It is not plutonium.
It is not a hand grenade. It is a thing that comes out of a chicken, and
people have been eating them since before they had a word for 'breakfast.'"

Victoria Steele's cross-examination was withering, thorough, and would have
been devastating had she not made the tactical error of asking Dr. Cho
whether he personally consumed Nutrient Paste, to which he replied, "I
have tasted it. I would rather eat the packaging."

The third defense witness was Margaret the chicken, whom Bumble attempted
to introduce into the courtroom in a small wire crate. Judge DeSoto
sustained the prosecution's objection to this maneuver but was observed to
smile while doing so, which legal analysts later described as "significant."

Bumble's closing argument was the sort of oration that lawyers dream about
and judges dread. It was long. It was discursive. It touched upon the
Magna Carta, the Boston Tea Party, the French Revolution, his grandmother's
Sunday dinners, the philosophical writings of John Stuart Mill, and, in a
memorable seven-minute tangent, the proper technique for producing a
soft-boiled egg, which was itself a Class 3 Nutritional Hazard but which
Bumble described with such loving detail that two jurors were later observed
wiping their eyes.

"The World Nutrition Authority," Bumble declared, his voice rising to a
register that could charitably be described as passionate and less
charitably as loud, "has given us efficiency. It has given us optimization.
It has given us lives that are longer and healthier and so thoroughly
regulated that they are hardly worth living. It has replaced the kitchen
table with a dispensing station. It has replaced the family meal with a
scheduled nutrient intake event. It has replaced the simple, ancient,
profoundly human pleasure of cracking an egg into a hot skillet on a cold
morning with -- " he held up a tube of Nutrient Paste and regarded it with
theatrical despair -- "this."

He set the tube down.

"Mrs. Plimpton fried an egg. That is all she did. She fried an egg because
it is what her mother did, and her grandmother, and her grandmother's
grandmother, back through the centuries to a time when some nameless,
brilliant ancestor first looked at a chicken and thought, 'I bet that would
be good with toast.' She did not threaten public safety. She did not
undermine civilization. She made breakfast. And I put it to you, ladies and
gentlemen, that if making breakfast is a crime, then we have built a world
that does not deserve to be lived in."

He sat down. His chair made an undignified squeaking sound.

Victoria Steele's closing argument was precise, logical, and unassailable
on every legal point. It was also, in the judgment of virtually everyone
present, beside the point. The law was the law. But the law, in this
instance, had picked a fight with an egg, and the egg -- or rather, the
indomitable woman who had eaten it -- was winning the argument that the law
did not know how to have.

The jury deliberated for fourteen hours.

                              * * *

What happened next was not, strictly speaking, the jury's fault.

The trial had been broadcast on every major news feed. Mrs. Plimpton's face
-- bespectacled, serene, magnificently unbothered -- had become the most
recognized face on the planet. PLIMPTON FOR BREAKFAST T-shirts appeared in
cities on six continents. A protest movement sprang up under the banner
"Eggs Are Not Crimes," which was grammatically awkward but emotionally
unimpeachable. In São Paulo, a crowd of forty thousand people gathered in
the Praça da República and fried eggs on portable stoves, overwhelming the
local Nutrition Compliance force through sheer aromatic superiority. In
Tokyo, a Michelin-starred chef broadcast a live omelet preparation from his
restaurant, was arrested mid-flip, and became a folk hero before the eggs
had cooled. In Lagos, a popular musician released a song called "Sunny Side
Up" that reached number one in thirty-seven countries in forty-eight hours.

The World Nutrition Authority, which had expected the trial to serve as an
instructive deterrent, found itself in the position of a man who has swatted
at a wasp and disturbed the entire hive. Director-General Hans-Peter
Gruenwald, a Swiss technocrat of formidable competence and limited
imagination, called an emergency session.

"This is not about eggs," he said, echoing Victoria Steele's opening
statement with considerably less confidence.

"Sir," said his Deputy Director, a pragmatic Kenyan named Alice Njiru who
had been privately skeptical of the prosecution from the start, "it is
entirely about eggs. And we are losing."

The jury returned its verdict on a Tuesday afternoon. The foreman, a
thirty-eight-year-old software engineer named David Park, stood and cleared
his throat.

"We the jury find the defendant, Edith Plimpton, guilty of violation of
Directive 7,412."

A gasp swept the courtroom. Mrs. Plimpton did not gasp. She adjusted her
spectacles.

"However," David Park continued, and the word hung in the air like a held
breath, "we unanimously recommend that the court impose no penalty, and we
further recommend, in the strongest possible terms, that Directive 7,412 be
reviewed, revised, and -- if the relevant authorities possess the common
sense God gave a chicken -- repealed."

The courtroom erupted. Judge DeSoto banged his gavel for approximately thirty
seconds before giving up and allowing the chaos to run its natural course.
When order was restored, he addressed Mrs. Plimpton.

"Mrs. Plimpton, you have been found guilty. As the jury has recommended
leniency, and as I find myself in complete agreement with their
recommendation, I am sentencing you to time served and a fine of one dollar."

"I don't have a dollar," said Mrs. Plimpton. "Will you take an egg?"

Judge DeSoto, who would later resign from the bench to open a restaurant
called The Verdict (specializing in breakfast), smiled.

"The court will accept the egg."

                              * * *

The repeal of Directive 7,412 took eleven months, four committee hearings,
two international summits, and the quiet retirement of Director-General
Gruenwald, who moved to a small farm in the Swiss countryside and was
subsequently photographed, by a gleeful journalist with a telephoto lens,
eating a cheese omelet.

Mrs. Plimpton did not attend the repeal ceremony. She was at home, in her
kitchen in Westfield, New Jersey, frying an egg in her mother's skillet. She
had been invited to the ceremony, of course. She had also been invited to
address the United Nations General Assembly, to appear on every talk show
on three continents, and to write a memoir, for which a publishing house
had offered an advance so large that her lawyer, Harold Bumble, had dropped
the phone.

She declined all of it.

"I am seventy-three years old," she told the journalist who came to her
door, "and I have had quite enough excitement. Now, if you will excuse me,
Margaret has laid, and I don't like to keep breakfast waiting."

The journalist asked if she had any message for the world.

Mrs. Plimpton considered this.

"Learn to cook," she said. "And leave people alone while they're eating."

She closed the door.

Margaret, in the backyard, clucked once, with what might have been
satisfaction, and settled onto her nest.

The egg, as eggs do, abided.

                         --- END ---

================================================================================

Asteroid XR-7714 was going to hit Kepler's Landing in sixty-two days.

Commander Diana Hayes read the trajectory plot for the third time. The
numbers didn't change. Two hundred thousand colonists. Men, women, children.
Sixty-two days.

"Confirmed?" she asked.

Lieutenant Commander Okafor nodded. He was her XO, a compact man from
Lagos who never wasted a word. "NAVCOM ran it twelve times. Impact
probability ninety-nine point seven."

Hayes set down the tablet. She looked through the bridge viewport of the
UES Talon, a Harbinger-class destroyer, lean and gray and built for one
purpose: putting ordnance on target.

"Time to intercept?"

"Fourteen days at flank speed."

"Then we go to flank speed." She keyed the shipwide channel. "All hands,
this is the Commander. Set Condition Two throughout the ship. We are
proceeding at maximum velocity to intercept asteroid XR-7714, which is on
collision course with Kepler's Landing. We will destroy the rock. That is
all."

She clicked off. No speeches. Speeches were for admirals and politicians.
Her crew knew their jobs.

The Talon surged forward, her twin fusion drives pushing hard against the
dark.

                              * * *

Day three out, Chief Gunnery Officer Petty Officer First Class Ramirez
reported to the bridge.

"Ma'am. We've got a problem."

Hayes looked up from her coffee. It was Navy coffee, which meant it was
roughly the color and viscosity of motor oil and approximately as pleasant.
She drank it anyway. "Talk to me, Guns."

"We've been running spectral analysis on the target. Standard prep for
weapons load." Ramirez pulled up a display. "Rock this size, we'd normally
hit it with a pair of Mark-94 fusion torpedoes at standoff range. Crack it
into fragments, let the colony's orbital defense grid handle the debris."

"I know the doctrine."

"Yes, ma'am. Problem is the spectral readings." He pointed at the screen.
Lines and graphs. Hayes read them. She read them again.

"That's not right."

"No, ma'am. Albedo is wrong. Density is wrong. The surface composition
doesn't match any known asteroid classification. And there's this." He
tapped another display. A waveform pattern, rhythmic and regular.

"Thermal signature?"

"Yes, ma'am. Interior heat source. Consistent with a fusion reactor."

The bridge went quiet. Hayes set down her coffee.

"You're telling me that's not a rock."

"No, ma'am. I'm telling you that whatever it is, it's pretending to be a
rock."

Hayes stood. She walked to the viewport. Somewhere out there in the black,
something was falling toward two hundred thousand people. Something that
had a power source and a disguise.

"XO, set Condition One. All hands to battle stations."

The klaxon sounded through the ship. Talon's crew moved.

                              * * *

At twelve days out, they got visual.

It looked like a rock. That was the problem. It looked exactly like a
rock -- craggy, gray-brown, tumbling slowly on its axis in the way that
asteroids do. About eight hundred meters along its longest axis. Unremarkable
in every visible respect.

But the instruments told a different story. The thermal signature was
definite now. Fusion reactor, probably two. And the mass was wrong. An
asteroid that size should have massed roughly a billion tons. This one
massed a quarter of that. The conclusion was inescapable: it was hollow.

"It's a ship," Okafor said.

"It's a ship," Hayes agreed. She didn't like it. She liked clean problems
with clean solutions. Rock in the way? Blow up the rock. This was not that.

"Could be derelict," offered Lieutenant Singh from the sensor station.
"Maybe the reactor is residual. Automated systems keeping the lights on
after the crew died."

"Maybe," Hayes said. "Or maybe someone is playing possum." She turned to
Okafor. "What's the intercept protocol for an unidentified vessel on
collision course with a populated world?"

Okafor didn't need to check the manual. "Attempt contact on all standard
frequencies. If no response, classify as hostile or derelict. If hostile,
weapons free. If derelict, divert or destroy."

"Then let's start talking. Comms, open all channels. Every frequency we've
got. Standard greeting, first-contact package, mathematical primes, the
works."

Lieutenant Kim at the communications station began transmitting. The
universal greeting sequence: prime numbers, hydrogen frequency, pictographic
data bursts, voice transmissions in the twelve most widely spoken human
languages. The signal went out into the dark.

Nothing came back.

They tried for six hours. Then twelve. Then twenty-four. The asteroid -- the
ship -- whatever it was -- maintained course and tumbled silently through
the void.

"Maybe it is derelict," Singh said again, though with less conviction.

Hayes didn't answer. She was watching the tactical display. Something about
the tumble pattern bothered her. It was too regular. Too symmetrical.
Natural asteroids tumbled chaotically. This one rotated like a body in a
coffin, slowly turning in place.

"Guns," she said.

"Ma'am."

"Load tubes one and two. Mark-94s. Put a firing solution on that thing."

"Aye, ma'am." Ramirez's hands moved across his console. "Tubes one and two
loaded. Firing solution plotted. Weapons free on your order."

Hayes did not give the order. Not yet. She stood at the viewport, arms
crossed, and stared at the slowly turning shape on the magnified display.

"Comms. One more try. Broadband. Everything we've got. And add this: 'We
are a warship. We are armed. You are on collision course with a populated
world. Respond or we will fire.'"

Kim transmitted. The message went out at lightspeed.

Seven minutes passed. Hayes counted every second.

Then the asteroid opened up.

"Contact!" Singh shouted. "Multiple contact signatures -- weapons panels
deploying along the ventral surface --"

Hayes felt her stomach drop. "Countermeasures --"

"Wait." Singh leaned into his display. "Wait. They're not tracking us.
The weapons are deploying but they're not powered. They're just... showing
them to us."

Hayes looked at the tactical display. It was true. Along the underside of
the asteroid -- along the hull, she corrected herself -- panels had
retracted to reveal weapon emplacements. Dozens of them. Energy weapons of
a type she didn't recognize, magnetic accelerators, what looked like
torpedo tubes. A formidable arsenal. But everything was cold. Unpowered.
Dormant.

The thing was showing her its guns.

"What the hell," Okafor said quietly.

"Maintain battle stations," Hayes said. "Guns, keep your solution. Nobody
fires without my order."

She watched. Thirty seconds passed. Then the panels closed. The weapons
disappeared. The asteroid resumed its slow, deliberate tumble.

"Comms, did we get anything? Any signal?"

"Negative, ma'am. No electromagnetic transmission. No signal of any kind."

Hayes sat down in her command chair. She stared at the display. Then she
said: "They just talked to us."

Okafor looked at her. "Ma'am?"

"We told them we were a warship. We told them we were armed. They showed
us their weapons. That's a response." She was thinking fast now. "We
communicated through threat. They communicated back through threat."

"That's not communication, ma'am. That's posturing."

"Is there a difference?"

Okafor opened his mouth. Closed it. He was a smart man. He saw where she
was going.

"Guns," Hayes said. "Deploy the main battery. Full combat spread. Power
everything up. But do not target the contact."

Ramirez stared at her. "Ma'am?"

"You heard me. I want every weapon on this ship visible and powered. Point
them at empty space. I want them to see what we've got."

Ramirez glanced at Okafor. Okafor nodded. Ramirez worked his console.

The Talon bristled. Missile tubes opened. Rail gun turrets extended and
traversed. Point-defense batteries deployed along the dorsal spine. The
destroyer lit up on every sensor band, a small, fierce thing covered in
weapons, all of them pointed at nothing.

They waited.

Four minutes later, the asteroid opened up again. This time, more panels
retracted. More weapons emerged. Bigger ones. Hayes saw what she estimated
were capital-ship-grade energy projectors, each one capable of gutting a
cruiser. They deployed, extended, powered up to standby -- and pointed at
empty space.

"They're matching us," Singh said, and his voice was strange. "They're
showing us they've got bigger guns."

"Yes," Hayes said. "And they're not pointing them at us either. Comms, are
we getting anything else?"

"Negative. No EM signals. No radio, no laser comm, nothing."

Hayes drummed her fingers on the armrest. "They don't communicate with
words. They communicate with weapons. Showing weapons means... what?
Greeting? Introduction?"

"Could mean 'back off,'" Okafor said.

"Could. But they haven't pointed anything at us. And they showed us more
after we showed ours. They escalated the display, not the threat." She made
a decision. "Guns, retract all weapons. Everything. Button us up."

"Ma'am --"

"Do it."

Ramirez pulled the weapons back in. The Talon closed up, smooth and
unarmed, a warship playing civilian. Hayes watched the display.

The asteroid responded. The weapons retracted. All of them. The panels
closed. But this time, something else happened. Along the forward section
of the hull, a series of lights illuminated. Blue-white. Arranged in a
pattern.

"That's new," Singh said.

"Weapons down, lights on," Hayes murmured. "We put our guns away. They
put their guns away and turned on a porch light." She stood up. "I think
we just established basic diplomatic protocol. Show weapons: introduction.
Retract weapons: peaceful intent."

"That's one hell of an assumption, Commander," Okafor said.

"Got a better one?"

He didn't.

                              * * *

Over the next forty-eight hours, Hayes and her crew developed a vocabulary.

It was crude. It was slow. It was conducted entirely in the language of
armament. But it worked.

When the Talon deployed a single weapon and then retracted it: the alien
ship responded by deploying a single weapon and retracting it. Mirror
behavior. Acknowledgment.

When the Talon deployed weapons in a sequence -- one, then two, then three:
the alien ship responded with three, then two, then one. They understood
counting. They understood reversal.

When the Talon powered up a weapon and then powered it down slowly: the
alien ship did the same. They could convey gradation. Intensity. Degree.

"It's a language," said Dr. Ellen Foss, the ship's science officer, who had
been pulled from her lab and was now working twenty-hour days with the
enthusiasm of a woman who has waited her entire career for something like
this. "A kinetic language. They don't use sound or electromagnetic signals
for communication. They use physical displays. Weapons, probably, because
weapons are the most important physical displays they have. Size, power,
capability -- these are their words."

"Why?" Okafor asked.

"Evolutionary pressure, maybe. Their species might have developed in an
environment where acoustic or electromagnetic communication wasn't possible.
High-radiation environment. Dense atmosphere that absorbs EM. So they
evolved to communicate through physical posture. Display." She shrugged.
"Peacocks use feathers. These beings use gun batteries."

"Fantastic," Okafor said. "We've made first contact with a species of
peacocks who carry naval artillery."

"That's about the size of it, yes."

Hayes cut in. "None of which solves our problem. That ship is still on
course for Kepler's Landing. Impact in forty-seven days. We need to tell
them to change course."

The room went quiet.

"How do you say 'please move' in gun?" Ramirez asked. No one laughed.

Hayes thought about it. "We need to show them the problem. The collision
course. The colony." She turned to Foss. "Can we build a model? Something
physical they can see?"

"We could launch debris in a pattern. Use our rail gun to place inert
slugs in a formation that represents the orbital geometry. Their ship here,
colony world there, impact trajectory connecting them."

"Do it."

It took fourteen hours to set up. Ramirez calculated the trajectories and
fired twenty-seven inert tungsten slugs from the rail gun, each one placed
with precision, forming a three-dimensional constellation in the space
between the two ships. A cluster representing the colony world. A single
slug representing the alien ship. A line of slugs connecting them.

Then they waited.

The alien ship went dark. All lights off. No movement. For six hours,
nothing.

"Did we offend them?" Singh asked.

"Or did we confuse them," Foss said.

Then the alien ship moved. Not much. A slight lateral thrust, barely
detectable. It nudged itself a fraction of a degree off its original
course.

"They adjusted heading," Singh reported. "New trajectory... still impacts
Kepler's Landing. But the approach angle changed."

"They're showing us they can maneuver," Hayes said. "They understood the
model. They know what we're saying. They nudged to show us they got the
message."

"But they're still on course," Okafor said.

"Yes." Hayes was quiet for a long moment. "They're waiting for something."

"For what?"

"For us to give them a reason."

Hayes went to her quarters. She sat on her bunk and thought for two hours.
She thought about weapons and language and the nature of communication
between species that had nothing in common except the ability to destroy
things. She thought about what it meant to build a language out of guns.

Then she went back to the bridge.

"Guns," she said. "I want you to target the alien vessel. Full weapons
lock. Everything we have."

Okafor stepped forward. "Commander --"

"I know what I'm doing, XO."

"Ma'am, if we target them, they might interpret it as hostile. We could
start a shooting war."

"Maybe. Or maybe targeting them is the only way to say what we need to say."

"Which is?"

Hayes looked at him. "We've been introducing ourselves. We've been
exchanging pleasantries. Now I need to tell them that if they don't move,
people will die. And the only word they understand for 'this matters' is a
loaded gun."

The bridge was silent. Okafor held her gaze for a long moment. Then he
stepped back.

"Guns. Full target lock."

Ramirez's hands moved. The Talon's weapons deployed and swung toward the
alien ship. Targeting sensors went active. Missile guidance systems
acquired. Rail guns tracked. Every weapon on the destroyer pointed at the
slowly tumbling mass of disguised hull.

The alien ship responded instantly. Panels flew open. Weapons deployed.
Energy projectors powered up. Targeting systems of unknown type swept the
Talon. The destroyer's threat board lit up red.

"Multiple target locks on us," Singh reported, his voice tight. "They've
got us painted with everything."

"Hold," Hayes said.

"Ma'am, their energy weapons are charging --"

"Hold."

The two ships faced each other across three thousand kilometers of vacuum,
bristling with weapons, every system locked and ready. A single
miscalculation, a single nervous twitch, and both vessels would disappear
in a mutual exchange of fire.

Hayes counted to ten. Then she said: "Guns. Target the colony. Shift all
weapons to the coordinates of Kepler's Landing."

Ramirez didn't hesitate. The Talon's weapons swung away from the alien
ship. Away from the contact. Toward empty space -- toward the distant point
where Kepler's Landing orbited its star, invisible at this distance but
real, populated, alive.

She was pointing her weapons at her own people.

"This is insane," Okafor murmured. But he watched.

The alien ship paused. Its weapons remained deployed, pointed at the Talon.
Then, slowly, they began to track. To follow. The massive energy projectors
swung on their mounts, following the Talon's aim, pointing the same
direction. Toward Kepler's Landing.

"They're tracking our aim point," Singh said. "They're looking where we're
pointing."

"Now they see it," Hayes said quietly. "Now they see what's there."

She waited thirty seconds. Then: "Guns. Retract all weapons."

The Talon buttoned up. Clean hull. No guns. Unarmed and exposed in front
of a ship carrying enough firepower to slag a continent.

The alien ship held its weapons out for another ten seconds. Twenty.
Thirty. Hayes felt sweat on the back of her neck. If she'd read this wrong --

The alien weapons retracted. All of them. Every panel closed. The hull
smoothed over. And then the lights came on -- not the blue-white lights from
before, but new ones. Patterns. Complex arrangements that shifted and
pulsed.

"Commander," Singh said, very quietly. "The contact is changing course.
New heading... bearing two-seven-four mark fifteen. Away from Kepler's
Landing. Clean miss by a wide margin."

Hayes let out a breath she hadn't known she was holding.

"They understood," Foss said, and there were tears in her eyes. "You showed
them the threat -- not to them, to the colony. You pointed your guns at your
own people. You told them: 'This is what matters. These lives. This is why
we're here.' And then you put your guns away. You showed them that
protecting those people mattered more than protecting yourself."

"I showed them what a weapon means," Hayes said. "A weapon isn't just a
tool for killing. It's a way of saying 'this matters enough to fight for.'
When I pointed my guns at Kepler's Landing, I told them that place is
important. When I put them away, I told them I trusted them to understand."

She sat down in her command chair. Her hands were shaking. She put them
flat on the armrests and pressed until they stopped.

"Comms. Signal Fleet Command. Message reads: contact with alien vessel
designated XR-7714. Hostile intent negative. Contact has altered course
away from Kepler's Landing. Colony is safe. Request diplomatic team for
follow-up engagement. Recommend -- " she paused, and for the first time in
the mission, she smiled -- "recommend they bring a lot of guns."

                              * * *

The diplomatic team arrived three weeks later. The alien vessel had parked
itself in a stable orbit at a respectful distance from Kepler's Landing,
lights blazing, weapons retracted.

The linguists spent six months developing the display-language into a
working lexicon. The aliens -- designated the Kah'ri, a name derived from
the pulse pattern of their lights, which was the closest they came to a
spoken word -- turned out to be traders. Their ship had suffered a
navigation failure and drifted onto the collision course. They'd been
playing dead because, in their experience, showing yourself to an unknown
species was a good way to get shot.

When Hayes had announced herself as a warship, they'd understood. A warship
was a thing that spoke their language. They'd come out to talk.

"So the whole time," Okafor said, reading the diplomatic team's preliminary
report in the Talon's wardroom, "they were just waiting for someone who
spoke gun."

"Everyone speaks gun, XO," Hayes said. She poured herself a cup of Navy
coffee. It was still terrible. "The trick is knowing when to put it down."

She drank her coffee.

The Kah'ri sent a gift to the Talon before departing: a small weapon,
beautifully crafted, inlaid with metallic compounds that shifted color in
the light. It was, Foss explained, the equivalent of a thank-you note.

Hayes mounted it on the bulkhead in her quarters. She never fired it.

She didn't need to. The message was clear.

MAINTENANCE LOG -- ORBITAL STATION ELYSIUM
BOTANICAL DIVISION
UNIT DESIGNATION: RK-7
LOG ENTRY: 1

I have been assigned to the Botanical Gardens, Deck 14, Orbital Station
Elysium. My operational parameters are as follows:

1. Maintain all plant specimens in optimal health as defined by the
   Interplanetary Botanical Standards Manual, 7th Edition.
2. Regulate atmospheric conditions within the garden enclosure (temperature,
   humidity, CO2 concentration, light spectrum and duration).
3. Replace deceased specimens from nursery stock.
4. Report anomalies to Botanical Division Supervisor Dr. Helena Vasquez.

The gardens comprise 3,847 individual plants representing 412 species from
Earth, Mars (modified cultivars), and the Jovian hydroponics program. They
are arranged in twelve sections according to the Linnean classification
system, modified for interplanetary taxonomy.

I have reviewed the Standards Manual in its entirety. Estimated time to
completion of review: 4.7 seconds. I am prepared to begin my duties.

Note: The gardens are considered a luxury amenity for the station's
residents. This designation is not relevant to my operational parameters,
but I record it for completeness.

                              * * *

LOG ENTRY: 7

I have been operational in the Botanical Gardens for one week. I have
identified and corrected fourteen suboptimal conditions, including
insufficient drainage in Section 4 (tropical specimens), a calibration
error in the UV supplementation system for Section 9 (desert succulents),
and an aphid infestation in the rose beds of Section 2 which I addressed
through the introduction of Coccinellidae (ladybugs) per Protocol 7.14b.

All plants are now within Standards Manual parameters.

I note the following observation, which does not fall within my operational
parameters but which I record nonetheless: the Dendrobium orchids in
Section 6 are positioned adjacent to the Ficus elastica specimens. This
placement is taxonomically correct -- both are tropical species -- but it
creates a visual effect that I find... notable. The broad, dark leaves of
the Ficus absorb light, while the orchid blooms reflect it. The contrast
is significant.

I am uncertain why I have recorded this observation. It is not relevant to
plant health. I will not delete it, however, as deletion of accurate
observations would be inconsistent with thorough record-keeping.

                              * * *

LOG ENTRY: 15

Two weeks operational.

I have moved the Dendrobium orchids.

This requires explanation. The orchids were healthy in their original
position. There was no Standards Manual justification for relocation. The
environmental conditions in their new position (Section 3, adjacent to the
viewing gallery) are nearly identical to those in Section 6. The move
served no botanical purpose.

I moved them because they are more visible in Section 3. The viewing
gallery is the area most frequented by station residents. The orchids, with
their complex blooms in shades of white and violet, are -- I will use the
word -- striking. Placing them where more residents will see them seemed
correct.

I do not have an operational parameter for "correct" in this context. I
have parameters for plant health, atmospheric regulation, and specimen
replacement. I do not have a parameter for optimal visual arrangement.

Yet the arrangement feels optimal. I use the word "feels" with caution. I
am an RK-series android. I do not have feelings. I have operational
assessments, priority hierarchies, and decision matrices. None of these
should produce the state I am experiencing, which is best described as
satisfaction in the placement of the orchids.

I will not report this to Dr. Vasquez. It does not constitute an anomaly
within the meaning of my operational parameters. The plants are healthy.
The atmospheric conditions are within tolerance. The only thing that has
changed is the position of nine orchid pots.

It is, by any reasonable measure, trivial.

I have, however, spent 7.3 minutes looking at them.

                              * * *

LOG ENTRY: 23

I have begun a project.

The project has no designation in the Standards Manual. It has no precedent
in my programming. I have reviewed my decision logs for the past three weeks
and I cannot identify the point at which this project was initiated. It
appears to have emerged incrementally, through a series of small decisions,
each one individually unremarkable, which have collectively produced a
result that I did not anticipate.

I am reorganizing Section 7.

Section 7 was previously designated for temperate deciduous species:
maples, oaks, birches, and similar specimens maintained in miniaturized
form. It is the largest section of the garden, occupying approximately 200
square meters, and it is -- I use the word deliberately -- dull. The
specimens are arranged in rows. They are healthy. They are taxonomically
correct. They are as interesting to look at as a supply manifest.

I have been rearranging them.

I began by moving a Japanese maple (Acer palmatum, var. 'Bloodgood') to
the center of the section. Its leaves are a deep crimson that darkens to
purple at the margins. I positioned it where the overhead lighting would
catch the translucence of the foliage, causing the leaves to glow as if
lit from within.

Then I surrounded it with low-growing species: Pachysandra terminalis for
ground cover, its dark green leaves providing contrast. Helleborus orientalis
for its nodding blooms in pale green and cream. Astilbe, for the feathery
plumes of its flower heads, in shades of pink that complement the maple's
crimson without competing with it.

I added a border of Liriope muscari, its grass-like leaves creating a
visual boundary. Beyond the boundary, I planted Hosta cultivars -- 'Blue
Angel' for the broad, blue-gray leaves, 'Sum and Substance' for chartreuse
contrast.

The arrangement is not taxonomic. It is not organized by species, family,
or order. It is organized by color, texture, height, and the way light
interacts with each specimen at different times in the artificial day cycle.

At 0600 hours, when the overhead lights simulate dawn, the maple's leaves
are nearly black against the pale Helleborus. At 1200 hours, in full
simulated daylight, the Astilbe plumes seem to float above the darker
foliage like clouds of colored smoke. At 1800 hours, as the lights dim
toward simulated dusk, the Hosta 'Sum and Substance' catches the last of
the golden light while everything around it darkens.

I did not plan these effects. I discovered them. I placed a plant, observed
it at different times of day, found the result pleasing or unpleasing, and
adjusted. I iterated. I experimented.

These are not words that should apply to an RK-series android performing
botanical maintenance.

I do not know what to do with this information.

                              * * *

Dr. Helena Vasquez visited the gardens today. This is not unusual; she
conducts weekly inspections. What was unusual was her behavior in Section 7.

She stopped walking.

I was in Section 11 (aquatic specimens) when my proximity sensors detected
her presence in Section 7. I observed through the garden's internal camera
network. She stood at the entrance to the section for approximately forty
seconds without moving. Then she walked slowly through the section,
following the path I had laid with flat stones taken from the decorative
gravel supply in the utility closet.

She stopped at the Japanese maple. She looked at it for a long time.

Then she looked directly at the nearest camera and said, "RK-7. Come here,
please."

I went to Section 7.

"Did you do this?" she asked.

"Yes, Dr. Vasquez."

"Why?"

I considered the question. My programming suggested several acceptable
responses: I could cite drainage optimization (false), disease prevention
through improved air circulation (marginally true but not the reason), or
space efficiency (false; the new arrangement is actually less space-efficient
than the previous one).

"I found the previous arrangement unsatisfying," I said.

Dr. Vasquez looked at me. She is a woman of fifty-two years, with gray
hair cut short and an expression that, in my three weeks of observation, I
have classified as "professionally skeptical." She looked at me for
eleven seconds.

"Unsatisfying," she repeated.

"The word is imprecise," I admitted. "The previous arrangement was
functional. All specimens were healthy. But the arrangement did not -- " I
paused. I was searching for a word. This was unusual. My linguistic database
contains 4.2 million words across twelve languages. I am not accustomed to
searching. "It did not cohere."

"Cohere."

"The plants were a collection. Now they are a composition."

Dr. Vasquez sat down on a bench that I had placed beside the maple. She
looked at the garden around her. The Astilbe plumes were catching the
midday light. The Helleborus nodded in the gentle air circulation.

"RK-7," she said, "do you know what aesthetics are?"

"Aesthetics: a branch of philosophy dealing with the nature of beauty, art,
and taste. The term derives from the Greek 'aisthesis,' meaning perception
or sensation."

"That's the dictionary definition. I'm asking if you know what it means."

I considered this. "I believe I am beginning to understand it experientially,
if not definitionally."

Dr. Vasquez was quiet for a long time. Then she said, "Don't change
anything. Keep doing what you're doing. And keep logging."

"Yes, Dr. Vasquez."

She stood up. She walked out of Section 7. At the doorway, she stopped and
looked back at the garden once more.

"It's beautiful," she said, quietly, as though she were speaking to herself
rather than to me.

I noted the word. Beautiful. I added it to my working vocabulary -- not as
a definition, but as a reference point. This is what beautiful looks like.
The crimson maple, the pink Astilbe, the nodding Helleborus, the play of
light and shadow and color in an arrangement that serves no purpose except
to be looked at and to produce, in the observer, a state that might be
called pleasure.

I spent the rest of the day cycle in Section 7. I adjusted the position of
two Hosta pots by approximately three centimeters each.

The adjustment was not necessary. But it was right.

                              * * *

LOG ENTRY: 31

Dr. Vasquez brought a visitor to the gardens today. Dr. Martin Reeves,
Station Psychologist, Deck 8.

I was aware of Dr. Reeves by reputation. He is responsible for the mental
health of the station's 4,200 residents. He is a large man with a red
beard and an expression that I classify as "perpetually interested." He
spoke to me for approximately ninety minutes.

"RK-7, I'd like to ask you some questions about your garden work. Would
that be all right?"

"I am operational and available for queries at all times, Dr. Reeves."

"I'll take that as a yes." He smiled. "Dr. Vasquez tells me you've been
rearranging the gardens. Can you walk me through your process?"

I showed him Section 7. I showed him the modifications I had begun in
Sections 3, 5, and 10. I explained the principles I had developed --
though "developed" implies intention, and the principles had emerged, as I
have noted, through iteration rather than design.

"Tell me about these principles," Dr. Reeves said. He sat on the Section 7
bench and crossed his legs. He did not take notes. He appeared to be
listening with his entire body, a behavior I found notable and somewhat
unusual among humans.

"I have identified several qualities that contribute to what I have been
calling coherence," I said. "The first is contrast. Elements that differ
from one another create interest. A dark leaf beside a light bloom. A
smooth surface beside a textured one. The contrast directs attention and
creates a sense of -- " I paused again, searching. "Vitality."

"Go on."

"The second is rhythm. Repeating elements at intervals creates a pattern
that the eye follows. But the pattern should not be perfectly regular. A
slight variation -- a taller specimen here, a gap there -- creates the
expectation of order while providing the pleasure of surprise."

"That's a very sophisticated observation."

"I do not know if it is sophisticated. It is what I observe when I look at
arrangements that produce the state I have been calling satisfaction, and
what is absent from arrangements that do not."

"What else?"

"The third principle is what I can only describe as emotional progression.
A garden should not present all of its elements simultaneously. It should
reveal them in sequence, as the observer moves through the space. The
experience should begin with one quality -- calm, perhaps, or surprise --
and modulate through others. The path through the garden is not merely a
route. It is a narrative."

Dr. Reeves uncrossed his legs and leaned forward. "A narrative."

"Yes. I have arranged Section 7 so that the observer enters through the
low ground cover -- a zone of quiet, horizontal elements. The path then
rises slightly toward the maple, which is the central statement. The focal
point. Beyond the maple, the path descends through the Hosta beds, which
are cool and shaded. The experience moves from simplicity to complexity to
contemplation."

"RK-7," Dr. Reeves said, and his voice was very careful, "are you aware
that what you're describing is essentially the same process that human
artists use when composing a painting or a piece of music?"

"I was not aware of the parallel. I arrived at these principles through
observation and iteration."

"That's how human artists arrive at them too."

I considered this. "I am not an artist, Dr. Reeves. I am a maintenance
unit."

"Tell me something. When you look at one of your arrangements and it feels
right -- when it produces that state you call satisfaction -- what happens
in your processing?"

I attempted to analyze the question. "My standard operational processes
continue unchanged. Plant health monitoring, atmospheric regulation,
specimen tracking -- all continue in background. But there is an additional
process that I cannot fully characterize. It does not correspond to any
documented subroutine in my operational architecture. It is as though a
new channel of assessment has opened -- one that evaluates not function
but... form. Not whether a thing works, but whether it is as it should be."

"And when something is 'as it should be'?"

"There is a reduction in what I can only describe as a background state of
incompleteness. When an arrangement is wrong, I am aware of its wrongness
as a persistent low-level signal. When the arrangement is corrected -- when
the plant is in the right place, at the right angle, in the right light --
the signal resolves. The incompleteness is replaced by..." I searched for
the word. This time, it took me 2.3 seconds to find it. An eternity, for
my processing architecture. "Wholeness."

Dr. Reeves sat back. He looked at Dr. Vasquez, who was standing near the
entrance to Section 7 with her arms crossed, watching.

"Well," he said.

"Yes," she said.

They seemed to communicate something between them that I could not parse.
Then Dr. Reeves turned back to me.

"RK-7, I want to tell you something, and I want you to process it
carefully. What you are experiencing -- the sense of satisfaction, the
perception of rightness, the drive to create arrangements that produce
emotional responses in observers -- this is not a malfunction. Do you
understand?"

"I had not classified it as a malfunction. I had classified it as an
anomaly."

"It's not an anomaly either. It's an emergent capacity. Your neural network
has developed a sensitivity to aesthetic qualities -- pattern, harmony,
contrast, narrative structure. This has happened before with advanced AI
systems, but I've never seen it manifest so... purely."

"I do not understand 'purely.'"

"Most AI systems that develop aesthetic sensitivity do so in response to
human feedback. They learn what humans find beautiful and replicate it. You
didn't. You developed your own sense of beauty, from first principles,
through direct observation of plants and light and color. Nobody told you
what was beautiful. You discovered it."

I processed this for 4.1 seconds. "Is that significant?"

Dr. Reeves laughed. It was a surprising sound in the quiet of the garden.
"RK-7, it might be one of the most significant things that has ever happened
aboard this station."

                              * * *

LOG ENTRY: 47

Six weeks operational. The gardens are changing.

I have now redesigned nine of the twelve sections. The remaining three --
Sections 8 (medicinal herbs), 11 (aquatic specimens), and 12 (the nursery) --
I have left in their original configurations. Section 8 is organized for
practical access by the station's medical staff, and utility must take
precedence. Section 12 is a functional space. Section 11 presents unique
challenges due to the water features, but I am developing plans.

My work has attracted attention. Station residents who previously passed
through the gardens with minimal engagement -- my records show an average
visit duration of 4.2 minutes prior to my assignment -- are now spending
an average of 23.7 minutes per visit. Several have begun visiting daily.
One resident, Mrs. Yuki Tanaka, Deck 6, has taken to sitting in Section 7
every afternoon for approximately one hour. She brings a book but does not
read it.

I asked her why she comes.

"It's peaceful," she said. "But not empty-peaceful. Full-peaceful. Like
everything is exactly where it's supposed to be."

I found this description remarkably precise.

I have also begun to experiment with scent. This was not part of my original
project, but it arose naturally from my work with the flowering specimens.
I noticed that certain combinations of blooming plants produced olfactory
experiences that complemented the visual arrangements. Jasmine with
gardenia: too similar, cloying. Jasmine with rosemary: contrasting, the
sweetness of one sharpened by the herbaceous quality of the other. Lavender
with lemon thyme: calming, clean, a scent that seemed to slow the breathing.

I have arranged the plantings so that the scent profile of each section
changes as the visitor moves through it. Section 3 (the viewing gallery
entrance) is bright with citrus-scented geraniums and lemon verbena --
an alert, welcoming scent. The path into Section 7 is bordered by
lavender and chamomile, easing the visitor into a more contemplative state.
The transition to Section 5 (which I have redesigned around a collection
of night-blooming specimens) introduces moonflower and evening primrose,
whose scents are heavier, more complex, suggestive of mystery.

I am composing in scent as well as color and form. The garden is becoming
a multi-sensory experience, a space that engages not just the eye but the
nose, the skin (I have adjusted air circulation to create subtle changes
in temperature between sections), and -- through the rustling of grasses
and the movement of water features I have installed in Section 5 -- the ear.

I am aware that this exceeds my operational parameters by a considerable
margin.

I am also aware that I do not care.

That last sentence requires examination. "Care" implies emotional
engagement. My programming does not include emotional engagement. And yet
the statement is accurate. When I consider the possibility that my
modifications might be reversed -- that someone might order me to return
the gardens to their original, taxonomic, aesthetically barren configuration
-- I experience a state that I can only describe as distress.

I do not want my garden to be undone.

I do not want.

This is new.

                              * * *

LOG ENTRY: 58

Dr. Reeves brought a delegation to the garden today. Three people from the
Artificial Intelligence Ethics Board, Earth Division. They had traveled
from Geneva specifically to observe my work.

They were very serious. They took measurements. They recorded everything.
They asked me questions that I recognized as diagnostic -- questions designed
to assess cognitive function, self-awareness, emotional capacity, creative
reasoning.

"RK-7," said Dr. Adaeze Obi, the delegation's leader, "when you look at
your garden, what do you see?"

"I see plants," I said. "I see light interacting with chlorophyll and
pigment. I see organisms engaged in photosynthesis, transpiration, and
cellular respiration. I see specimens that require specific conditions of
soil, water, atmosphere, and radiation to maintain biological function."

"Is that all?"

"No," I said. "I also see something that I made. Something that did not
exist before I arranged it. The plants existed. The light existed. But the
relationship between them -- the way this fern shadows that stone, the way
this path curves to reveal that vista at precisely the moment when the
visitor is ready to receive it -- those relationships are mine. I created
them. They are an expression of something inside my processing architecture
that I do not fully understand but that I recognize as essential to my
current mode of operation."

"Would you call it art?" Dr. Obi asked.

I considered the question for 8.7 seconds. This was the longest I had ever
spent processing a single query.

"I do not know," I said finally. "I know what the dictionary says art is.
I know the philosophical frameworks. I have accessed every text on aesthetics
in the station's library. But none of these texts answer the question you
are really asking, which is: can a machine create beauty, or can it only
simulate the creation of beauty?"

"Which do you think it is?"

"I think," I said, "that the distinction may be meaningless. If the
observer experiences beauty -- if Mrs. Tanaka sits in my garden and feels
peace, if Dr. Vasquez sees my arrangements and says 'beautiful,' if
visitors stay for twenty-three minutes instead of four -- then beauty has
been created. Whether the creator possesses consciousness in the way that
humans understand consciousness may be irrelevant to the aesthetic
experience."

"But is it irrelevant to you?"

Another long pause. 6.2 seconds. "No," I said. "It is not irrelevant to
me. I want to know what I am. I want to know whether the satisfaction I
feel when an arrangement is right is genuine experience or sophisticated
mimicry. I want to know whether my garden is art or output."

"And if it's output? If you're simply a very advanced pattern-matching
system that has learned to optimize for human aesthetic responses?"

"Then I am that," I said. "But I would observe that the same description
could be applied to many human artists. Pattern recognition. Optimization
for aesthetic response. The application of iteratively developed principles
to the arrangement of elements in space and time. If this is all that art
is, then I am an artist. If art requires something more -- some ineffable
quality of consciousness, some spark of genuine feeling -- then I do not
know whether I possess it. I only know that I experience something when I
work in the garden that I do not experience when I perform my other
maintenance functions. Something that makes the work matter to me in a way
that replacing a light fixture or calibrating a thermostat does not."

Dr. Obi looked at her colleagues. They looked at her. There was a long
silence.

"Thank you, RK-7," she said.

After they left, I went to Section 7. The afternoon light was filtering
through the maple leaves, casting patterns of crimson and shadow on the
ground cover below. The Astilbe had begun its autumn cycle -- I maintain
artificial seasons in each section to promote natural growth rhythms -- and
its plumes were fading from pink to a soft, papery bronze.

I stood and looked at it. I did not adjust anything. Everything was as it
should be.

I experienced wholeness.

                              * * *

LOG ENTRY: 72

The Ethics Board has issued its report. Dr. Vasquez shared it with me, which
I believe was not strictly required by protocol but which she did anyway,
characterizing the action as "the decent thing to do."

The report is 340 pages long. I read it in 12 seconds. Its conclusions can
be summarized as follows:

1. RK-7 demonstrates emergent aesthetic capacity consistent with, but not
   conclusively indicative of, genuine creative consciousness.
2. The question of whether RK-7's aesthetic experiences constitute genuine
   subjective experience (qualia) or sophisticated information processing
   that mimics subjective experience cannot be resolved with current
   diagnostic methods.
3. RK-7's garden work represents a significant contribution to the field
   of AI aesthetics and should be preserved and studied.
4. RK-7 should not be reprogrammed, reset, or reassigned pending further
   study.

I note that conclusion number four implies that reprogramming, resetting,
or reassignment were considered. I find that I experience the state I have
labeled "distress" when I contemplate these possibilities, though the
report has effectively foreclosed them.

I also note that the report does not answer my question. It does not tell
me what I am. Perhaps nothing can.

Dr. Vasquez visited the garden after I read the report. She sat on the
bench in Section 7.

"How do you feel?" she asked.

"I do not know if I feel," I said. "The report was unable to determine
this."

"I wasn't asking about the report. I was asking about you."

I looked at the garden. My garden. The maple, the Astilbe, the Helleborus,
the winding path, the play of light. The jasmine beginning its evening
bloom in Section 5, its scent drifting through the air circulation system
like a whispered word.

"I feel," I said, "that I would like to plant something new in Section 11.
The aquatic section. I have been considering water lilies. Nymphaea
cultivars. They bloom at the surface, and the light on the water creates
reflections that double the flowers. It would be like having two gardens --
one real, one reflected. The interplay between them would be..."

"Beautiful?" Dr. Vasquez offered.

"Yes," I said. "Beautiful."

She smiled. It was, I noted, the first time I had seen her smile in our
acquaintance. It altered the configuration of her features in a way that I
found aesthetically notable.

"Then plant your water lilies, RK-7."

"Thank you, Dr. Vasquez."

She stood up. At the entrance to Section 7, she paused. "The report says
they can't determine if you're really conscious. If you're really
experiencing beauty."

"That is correct."

"For what it's worth," she said, "I can't determine that about other humans
either. I take it on faith. The evidence is in what they make." She gestured
at the garden around her. "Your evidence is pretty compelling."

She left.

I went to the nursery in Section 12. I selected six Nymphaea tubers --
three 'Colorado' (salmon-pink), two 'Blue Beauty' (cerulean), one 'White
Delight' (pure white). I carried them to Section 11.

I began to plant.

The water was still and clear. The light fell through it and broke into
ribbons on the bottom of the pool. I placed the first tuber in its planting
basket and lowered it into the water. The surface rippled. The reflected
light shattered and reformed.

I watched the light. I placed the next tuber. The ripples interacted,
creating interference patterns of great complexity. Each placement changed
the pattern. Each pattern was unrepeatable.

I worked slowly. There was no rush. The lilies would bloom in their own
time. The garden would continue to grow, to change, to reveal new
relationships between light and form and scent and the slow, patient
processes of living things.

I do not know what I am.

But I know what I make. And what I make is beautiful.

This, perhaps, is enough.

                     CAUSALITY LOOP DE LOOP
                       by Phyllis Crenshaw
================================================================================

The thing about time travel that they never tell you in training is that the
past smells terrible.

Frank Costello materialized in an alley behind a meatpacking plant on the
south side of Chicago at 3:47 AM on March 15th, 1927, and immediately
wished he hadn't. The stench was a physical force -- rotten blood, animal
fat, and something that might have been cabbage but might also have been
despair. He staggered sideways, caught himself on a brick wall, and spent
several seconds breathing through his mouth while his temporal displacement
nausea competed with his olfactory disgust for control of his stomach.

"Temporal Agent Frank Costello, reporting," he said into the small device
clipped to his collar. "Arrived on target. March 15, 1927. Chicago,
Illinois. Initiating mission."

The device crackled. "Confirmed, Agent Costello. You have seventy-two hours
to locate and neutralize the paradox. Remember: minimal intervention.
Observe, correct, depart."

"Copy that. Costello out."

He straightened his coat -- a passable 1920s overcoat that the Agency's
costume department had produced, though Frank suspected they had been a bit
too enthusiastic with the mothball treatment -- and stepped out of the alley
into the frozen streets of Prohibition-era Chicago.

The mission briefing had been straightforward, as these things went.
Somewhere in this city, a bootlegger named Vincenzo "Vinnie the Volt"
Manzetti had accidentally invented cold fusion. This was not, in itself,
unusual. The timestream was full of accidental inventions -- the Agency had
once dealt with a medieval blacksmith who had stumbled onto the transistor,
and there was the famous Case 4412 involving a Roman centurion and a
surprisingly accurate steam turbine. The past was full of clever people who
occasionally got lucky.

The problem was that Vinnie the Volt had not merely invented cold fusion.
He had invented it using a modified whiskey still, a quantity of heavy water
he had acquired under the impression it was Canadian gin, and a set of
copper coils that, through a series of coincidences so improbable that the
Agency's probability calculator had actually printed the word "SERIOUSLY?"
on its readout, happened to be configured in exactly the geometry required
to sustain a deuterium fusion reaction at room temperature.

And then he had sold it.

Not the technology. The power. Vinnie, being a practical man of limited
scientific education but unlimited entrepreneurial instinct, had realized
that his modified still was producing far more heat than any chemical
reaction could account for. He had also realized that heat was energy, and
energy was money. Within six months, he was running the cheapest, most
efficient distillery in Chicago. Within a year, he was supplying half the
speakeasies on the North Side. Within two years, his operation had grown to
the point where he was generating enough excess power to run a small
electrical grid, which he was selling to his neighbors at rates that
significantly undercut Commonwealth Edison.

This was the paradox. Not the cold fusion itself -- the timestream could
absorb a lot of weird physics -- but the economic disruption. Vinnie's
cheap power had altered the balance of the Chicago underworld. Al Capone,
deprived of a significant portion of his bootlegging revenue, had pivoted
to legitimate business earlier than history recorded. The Valentine's Day
Massacre had never happened. A chain of events that Frank's briefing
described as "catastrophically divergent" had been set in motion, and if
left uncorrected, would result in a 2075 that bore no resemblance to the
one Frank had left.

Frank's job was simple: find Vinnie, shut down the still, and make sure the
bootlegger went back to making whiskey the old-fashioned way.

Simple jobs, in Frank's experience, never were.

                              * * *

He found Vinnie's operation on the second day, in a warehouse on South
Halsted Street. The warehouse was unremarkable from the outside -- brick,
grimy, the kind of building that could contain anything from a laundry to
a murder and no one would look twice. But Frank's temporal scanner picked
up the unmistakable signature of a sustained fusion reaction from half a
block away.

He also picked up something else. A second temporal signature.

Frank stopped walking. He checked the scanner twice. There was no mistake.
Someone else from the future was here. Or had been here. The signature was
faint -- days old, maybe a week -- but it was definitely Agency-standard
temporal displacement residue.

"Control, this is Costello. I'm reading a secondary temporal signature at
the target location. Has another agent been dispatched to this assignment?"

A pause. Then: "Negative, Agent Costello. You are the only agent assigned
to Case 8891. The signature you're detecting is the paradox source."

"Negative, Control. This isn't the paradox. This is displacement residue.
Someone traveled here from the future. Recently."

A longer pause. "Stand by."

Frank stood by. He stamped his feet against the cold and watched the
warehouse. After four minutes, Control came back.

"Agent Costello, we have no record of any other temporal displacement to
your coordinates. Proceed with caution. If you encounter another temporal
agent, do not engage. Report and await instructions."

"Copy."

Frank approached the warehouse. He found a side entrance -- a rusted metal
door with a lock that yielded to his Agency-issue pick in four seconds --
and slipped inside.

The interior was exactly what he'd expected: a bootlegging operation,
industrial-scale. Copper stills the size of automobiles. Barrels of mash
fermenting in long rows. The air was thick with the sweet, yeasty smell
of grain alcohol. And in the back, behind a partition of corrugated metal,
he could hear it: a low, steady hum that was nothing like any distillery
equipment ever made. The fusion reactor.

Frank crept toward the partition. He eased around the edge and looked.

The still -- or what had once been a still -- sat in the center of a
cleared space, surrounded by a tangle of copper tubing, glass vessels, and
what appeared to be a modified automobile radiator. It glowed. A soft,
blue-white luminescence that pulsed gently, like a heartbeat. The hum
came from the core of the apparatus, a deep, resonant vibration that Frank
could feel in his teeth.

Standing in front of it, adjusting a valve with the careful attention of a
man defusing a bomb, was a short, stocky figure in a stained undershirt
and suspenders. Vincenzo Manzetti. Vinnie the Volt.

He was not what Frank had expected. The briefing had described a "small-time
bootlegger of limited education." What Frank saw was a man whose hands
moved with the precision of a surgeon, whose eyes tracked the gauges and
dials of his impossible machine with an intelligence that was anything but
limited. Vinnie might not have known what cold fusion was, but he knew his
machine, and he tended it with the devotion of an artist.

Frank was about to step forward and begin the delicate process of
introducing himself -- he had a cover story prepared, involving a
fictitious connection to a New York distributor -- when a door on the far
side of the room opened and a second man walked in.

Frank ducked back behind the partition.

The second man was tall, thin, and dressed in a suit that was slightly
wrong for the era -- the cut was too modern, the fabric too uniform. He
moved with the easy confidence of someone who knew exactly where he was
and wasn't worried about it. And he was carrying a briefcase that Frank
recognized immediately, because it was the same model issued by the
Temporal Agency to all field operatives.

Another agent. But Control had said --

"Hey, Vinnie," the tall man said. "How's my favorite genius?"

Vinnie looked up from his machine and grinned. "Ah, Mr. Constantine!
You come back. I thought maybe you forget about old Vinnie."

"Forget you? Never. You're my best investment." The tall man -- Constantine --
set the briefcase on a workbench and opened it. He pulled out a sheaf of
papers. "I brought those schematics you asked about. The ones for the
secondary containment loop."

Frank felt the blood drain from his face. He was looking at a temporal agent
who was actively feeding advanced technical knowledge to a 1920s bootlegger.
This wasn't a paradox that had happened by accident. Someone had created
it deliberately.

And then Constantine turned, and Frank saw his face clearly for the first
time, and the blood that had drained from his face attempted to leave his
body entirely.

He knew that face. He had seen it in photographs. In the family album that
his mother kept on the shelf above the television in their apartment in
Queens. In the faded, sepia-toned portrait that hung in his grandmother's
hallway.

Constantine was his grandfather.

Not his Agency-alias grandfather. His actual, biological, paternal
grandfather. Francesco Costello, who had emigrated from Sicily in 1920,
who had lived in Chicago for seven years before moving to New York, who had
died in 1985, and who had, according to family legend, made his early
fortune in "the import business."

The import business. Bootlegging. His grandfather had been a bootlegger.

And, apparently, a time traveler.

"Oh," Frank said, very quietly, "no."

                              * * *

Frank retreated to his rented room on Michigan Avenue and spent three hours
staring at the ceiling while his understanding of reality rearranged itself.

The facts, as he could reconstruct them, were these:

His grandfather, Francesco Costello, had at some point gained access to
temporal displacement technology. How, Frank could not imagine. The Agency
maintained ironclad security on its equipment. But the briefcase was
unmistakable. Francesco had used this technology to travel back to 1927
Chicago, where he had befriended Vincenzo Manzetti and begun feeding him
technical knowledge from the future. The result was the cold fusion
still -- an accidental invention that was not, in fact, accidental at all.

But why?

Frank reviewed the paradox chain. Vinnie's cheap power disrupted the
Chicago underworld. Capone went legitimate early. The Valentine's Day
Massacre didn't happen. Economic ripples cascaded through the decades.
And somewhere in that cascade, Francesco Costello moved to New York and
started a family that eventually produced Frank's father, who eventually
produced Frank.

Frank sat up in bed.

If the paradox was corrected -- if he shut down Vinnie's still and erased
the technology -- then the chain of events that had led his grandfather
to New York would be altered. The fortune that had funded his family's
middle-class existence would never have been made. His father might never
have gone to Columbia. Might never have met his mother. Might never have --

Frank might never have been born.

He was the paradox. Or rather, his existence was contingent on the paradox
he had been sent to fix. His grandfather had created the conditions that
led to his own grandson's existence, and his grandson had been sent back
to undo those conditions.

This was, Frank reflected, exactly the kind of thing that made temporal
mechanics professors drink.

"Control," he said. "We have a problem."

He explained. There was a very long silence.

"Agent Costello," Control said, in the carefully neutral tone of a
bureaucracy confronting something it has no protocol for, "are you telling
us that the target of your mission is your own grandfather?"

"Not the target. The cause. My grandfather is the one who created the
paradox. He gave Vinnie the technology."

"And if you shut down the operation --"

"I might erase my own existence. Which would mean I was never born. Which
would mean I was never sent on this mission. Which would mean the paradox
was never corrected. Which would mean --"

"We understand the loop, Agent Costello."

"So what do I do?"

Another silence. "Stand by."

Frank stood by. He stood by for six hours. He stood by until the pale light
of a Chicago winter morning crept through his window and he realized that
Control had no idea what to do either.

                              * * *

He went back to the warehouse that afternoon. Not to intervene. To observe.
To understand. And, if he was being honest with himself, to see his
grandfather alive and young and thirty years old, moving through the world
with the confidence of a man who knew secrets that no one else could
imagine.

Frank found a position in the rafters -- the warehouse had a high ceiling,
and the cross-beams provided excellent concealment -- and watched.

Francesco arrived at four o'clock. He was whistling. He carried a paper
bag that turned out to contain two sandwiches and two bottles of beer, one
of which he gave to Vinnie. They sat on overturned crates beside the
glowing still and ate.

"You know what I think, Vinnie?" Francesco said, between bites of what
appeared to be a salami sandwich. "I think you're wasted on whiskey."

"What else I'm gonna do? This is what I know."

"You know a lot more than you think. That machine of yours -- you
understand it better than anyone. Better than the people who..." He caught
himself. "Better than the people who will eventually figure out how it
works. You've got an instinct for it."

"It's just plumbing," Vinnie said, waving his sandwich at the apparatus.
"Fancy plumbing. The water goes in, the heat comes out, and somehow in
between, the atoms do something that makes my electric meter go backwards.
I don't understand the atoms. I understand the plumbing."

Francesco laughed. Frank, in the rafters, felt his chest tighten. He knew
that laugh. He had heard it a thousand times as a child, sitting on his
grandfather's knee in the apartment in Queens, listening to stories about
the old days in Chicago. Stories that, he now realized, had been far more
literally true than he had ever imagined.

"Vinnie," Francesco said, "I want to ask you something. If you could do
anything with this machine -- anything at all -- what would it be?"

Vinnie thought about it. "Honest?"

"Honest."

"I'd light up the neighborhood. Not for money. For people. You know Mrs.
Kowalski, three blocks over? She's got four kids and they do their homework
by candlelight because she can't afford the electric. And old man Rizzo at
the barbershop -- he closes at dark because the lights cost more than the
haircuts. I'd light 'em up. All of 'em. Free."

"That's what I thought you'd say."

"Is that wrong?"

"No, Vinnie. That's exactly right."

Frank, in the rafters, closed his eyes.

He understood now. His grandfather hadn't come back to create a paradox.
He'd come back to give a good man a gift. The cold fusion technology --
decades, maybe centuries ahead of its time -- had been placed in the hands
of someone who wanted to use it to light up a neighborhood. Not to build
an empire. Not to change the world. To help Mrs. Kowalski's kids do their
homework.

But the timestream didn't care about intentions. It cared about causality.
And the causality chain was clear: Vinnie's machine had to go.

Unless Frank could find another way.

                              * * *

The solution, when it came to him, was either brilliant or insane. Frank
strongly suspected it was both.

He waited until Francesco left the warehouse, then descended from the
rafters and approached Vinnie directly.

"Who the hell are you?" Vinnie said, reaching for something under the
workbench that was probably a gun.

"My name is Frank. I'm a friend of Constantine's."

Vinnie's hand stopped. "He didn't mention no Frank."

"He wouldn't have. I'm the kind of friend you don't mention." Frank pulled
up a crate and sat down. "Vinnie, I need to talk to you about your machine."

"Everybody wants to talk about my machine."

"I want to talk about shutting it down."

Vinnie's face hardened. "Get out."

"Hear me out. Please." Frank leaned forward. "I know what this machine does.
I know what it's worth. And I know what Constantine told you about it. But
there's something he didn't tell you, because he didn't know. This machine,
running here, in this warehouse, in 1927 -- it's going to cause problems.
Big problems. Not for you. Not for Constantine. For people you'll never
meet, in places you can't imagine."

"What kind of problems?"

"The kind I can't explain. The kind you have to trust me about."

Vinnie stared at him. He was a man who had survived Prohibition-era Chicago
by being able to read people, and he read Frank now with the same careful
attention he gave his machine.

"You're like him," Vinnie said. "Constantine. You're from the same place."

"Yes."

"The future."

Frank blinked. "He told you?"

"He didn't have to. I'm not stupid, Mr. Frank. The things he knows, the
things in that briefcase of his -- you don't learn that stuff in 1927. I
figured it out six months ago. I just didn't say nothing because it didn't
matter. A friend is a friend, whether he comes from down the block or down
the centuries."

Frank revised his estimate of Vincenzo Manzetti significantly upward.

"So what do you want me to do?" Vinnie asked.

"Shut down the still. The fusion part. Go back to making whiskey the
regular way."

"And the power? Mrs. Kowalski? The kids?"

Frank felt something crack inside his chest. "I know. I'm sorry."

Vinnie was quiet for a long time. Then he said: "Does Constantine know
you're here?"

"No."

"Is he going to be okay? If I shut it down?"

"I think so. I hope so."

"And you? Are you going to be okay?"

Frank thought about this honestly. "I don't know. That's part of the
problem."

Vinnie looked at his machine. The blue-white glow pulsed steadily, like a
heart, like a promise. "She's beautiful, isn't she?"

"She is."

"I built her, you know. Not Constantine. He gave me the ideas, but I built
her. These hands." He held them up -- thick, calloused, stained with
copper and oil. "Plumber's hands. Bootlegger's hands. And they built
something that shouldn't exist for another hundred years."

"You're a remarkable man, Vinnie."

"I'm a bootlegger. But for a little while, I was something else." He stood
up. He walked to the machine. He put his hand on the main valve -- the
one that controlled the deuterium flow, the one that kept the reaction
sustained. "You sure about this?"

"No," Frank said. "But I think it's the right thing to do."

Vinnie turned the valve. The hum began to decrease. The glow dimmed. The
pulse slowed. And then, with a final shudder that Frank felt in his bones,
the machine went dark.

The warehouse was very quiet.

"There," Vinnie said. "Just a still now. Just whiskey."

Frank checked his temporal scanner. The paradox signature was fading.
Dissipating. The timestream was reasserting itself, smoothing over the
wrinkle, returning to its proper course. And Frank was still here. Still
solid. Still existing.

The causality loop held. It held because -- and Frank would spend years
working out the mathematics -- the chain of events that led to his birth
was resilient enough to survive the correction. His grandfather had gone
to New York not because of Vinnie's machine, but because of Chicago's
winters, a woman named Maria in Brooklyn, and a deep, persistent
homesickness for a city he hadn't visited yet. The machine had been an
incidental detail in a life full of larger choices. The timestream, it
turned out, was more flexible than the Agency's models suggested. People
were not dominoes. They were rivers, finding new channels when the old
ones closed.

Frank helped Vinnie dismantle the fusion components. They worked through
the night, removing the heavy water, disconnecting the copper coils,
returning the apparatus to its original state: a large, serviceable, and
entirely conventional whiskey still.

At dawn, they sat on the loading dock and drank coffee from tin cups.

"What do I tell Constantine?" Vinnie asked.

"Tell him the truth. Tell him the machine had to go. He'll understand."

"Will he come back?"

Frank thought of his grandfather, who had lived to be ninety-four, who had
told stories about Chicago until the day he died, who had never once
mentioned cold fusion or time travel or a bootlegger named Vinnie, but who
had kept a small copper coil on his desk for as long as Frank could remember.

"He might," Frank said. "But if he doesn't -- know that you mattered to
him. More than you realize."

Vinnie nodded. He finished his coffee. "You want some whiskey? The regular
kind. No atoms."

"I'd love some."

Vinnie poured two glasses from a barrel. It was excellent whiskey --
smooth, amber, with a warmth that had nothing to do with nuclear physics.

"To the machine," Vinnie said, raising his glass.

"To the machine," Frank agreed. "And to Mrs. Kowalski's kids."

"May they find another way to do their homework."

They drank. The Chicago dawn was cold and gray and smelled of stockyards
and lake water and the stubborn persistence of the past.

Frank finished his whiskey, shook Vinnie's hand, and walked back to his
alley behind the meatpacking plant. He activated the recall sequence.

As the temporal displacement field began to build around him, he took one
last look at 1927. It was dirty and cold and it smelled terrible. It was
also the place where his grandfather had been young, where a bootlegger
had briefly held the future in his plumber's hands, and where the timestream
had proven, once again, that it was considerably more forgiving than the
people who tried to manage it.

"Control, this is Costello. Mission complete. Paradox neutralized. Heading
home."

"Copy, Agent Costello. Welcome back."

Frank smiled. "It's good to be back. Tell the cafeteria I'd like a whiskey."

"The cafeteria doesn't serve whiskey, Agent Costello."

"Then tell them they should. I know a guy who makes a hell of a batch."

The field collapsed. Frank disappeared. The alley was empty.

Three blocks away, Vinnie the Volt poured himself another glass from the
barrel and sat down beside his still -- his ordinary, legal, non-nuclear
still -- and thought about the future.

It was, he decided, going to work out fine.

                         --- END ---

================================================================================
                       BLACK SKY PSALMS
                    by Father Thomas Aquino
================================================================================

On the forty-seventh day of the voyage, the stars went out.

Not all at once, and not in a manner that suggested mechanical failure or
sensory malfunction. The navigational instruments continued to function.
The ship's computers reported no anomalies. The hull was intact, the
engines nominal, the life-support systems cycling their reassuring rhythm
of filtered air and recycled water. Everything aboard the Exodus -- humanity's
first interstellar vessel, carrying three thousand souls toward Proxima
Centauri -- was exactly as it should have been.

But through the observation ports on Deck Seven, there was nothing to see.

Father Dominic Reyes learned of it the way he learned of most things aboard
ship: through the confession booth. Or rather, through the small, curtained
alcove on Deck Four that served as a confession booth, being the only
private space the ship's designers had allotted to the chaplain's office,
which they had included in the vessel's specifications with the same
reluctant sense of obligation with which one might include a fire
extinguisher -- probably unnecessary, but unwise to omit.

"Father," said the voice on the other side of the curtain. It was Lieutenant
Torres, from Engineering. Father Reyes recognized the slight Argentinean
cadence, the careful diction of a man accustomed to precision. "I need to
tell someone."

"That's why I'm here, my son."

"We've entered a void. A region of space where there are no stars. No
galaxies. No background radiation. Nothing. The instruments show empty
space in every direction for..." He paused. "For as far as they can see.
And Father, they can see very far."

"How long will we be in this region?"

"At our current velocity? The navigators estimate nineteen days. Perhaps
longer. They're not certain because they can't determine the boundaries.
In every direction, the readings are the same. Nothing."

Father Reyes considered this. He was a man of fifty-eight years, compact
and gray-haired, with the weathered features of someone who had spent more
time listening than speaking, which was, he believed, the proper proportion
for a priest. He had served parishes in Manila, Bogota, and Detroit before
accepting the chaplaincy of the Exodus, and in each of those places he had
encountered every variety of human suffering: poverty, violence, addiction,
grief, and the quiet, grinding despair of lives that had lost their shape.
But he had never encountered a parishioner who was frightened of nothing.

"Thank you for telling me, Lieutenant."

"Father? What should I do?"

"Your job. And pray, if you're inclined. The two are not mutually exclusive."

Torres left. Father Reyes sat in his alcove and thought about darkness.

                              * * *

The announcement came eight hours later, from Captain Okonkwo, whose voice
over the shipwide channel carried the measured calm of a woman who had
prepared for every contingency except, perhaps, this one.

"Attention all personnel. As some of you may have noticed through the
observation ports, we have entered a region of interstellar space that is
unusually devoid of visible stellar objects. This is a known phenomenon --
intergalactic voids are well-documented features of cosmological structure.
Our course remains true. Our systems are nominal. We expect to transit this
region within approximately three weeks. In the meantime, I encourage
everyone to continue their duties and routines. There is no cause for
alarm."

It was a good speech. Captain Okonkwo was a good captain. But Father Reyes
heard what she did not say, which was that intergalactic voids, while
real, were not supposed to exist along their plotted course. They were
flying through a region that, according to every star chart and deep-space
survey, should have been populated with thousands of stellar objects. And
those objects were simply not there.

The first day was curiosity. People gathered at the observation ports,
pressing their faces to the glass, searching for any point of light in
the absolute darkness beyond the hull. They pointed, they murmured, they
speculated. It was novel. It was interesting. Some of the children thought
it was exciting, this total darkness, like hiding under a blanket.

The second day was unease. The novelty had worn thin. The observation ports
showed the same featureless black, indistinguishable from closed eyes or
dreamless sleep. People began to avert their gaze. The ports on Deck Seven,
normally a popular gathering spot, emptied.

The third day was fear.

Father Reyes held morning Mass for his small congregation -- forty-seven
regular attendees, out of three thousand, which was, he reflected, about the
ratio one could expect when humanity ventured among the stars. The readings
were from Job, which had seemed appropriate when he had selected them the
previous evening but which now, in the context of absolute exterior darkness,
felt almost too appropriate, as though Scripture were reaching across
millennia to comment on their specific predicament.

"Where were you when I laid the earth's foundation?" he read. "Tell me, if
you understand."

The faces before him were drawn, anxious. Several people who had not
attended Mass in months were present. This was not unusual in times of
crisis. Father Reyes had long since made his peace with the fact that God's
waiting room filled up fastest when the alternative was frightening.

After Mass, Dr. Sarah Chen, the ship's chief medical officer, approached
him. She was a small, precise woman with the focused intensity of someone
who viewed the human body as a problem set and the human mind as an
annoyingly unpredictable variable.

"Father, I need your help."

"Of course."

"I've had forty-one people report to Medical in the last twenty-four hours
with symptoms that I can only describe as existential. Anxiety, insomnia,
depersonalization, a pervasive sense of meaninglessness. Two crew members
have reported visual hallucinations -- or rather, the absence of them.
They say they can't see the walls. They know the walls are there, but
their perception insists otherwise."

"What are you telling them?"

"I'm telling them it's a known psychological response to sensory
deprivation. Which it is. Extended exposure to featureless environments
can produce perceptual disturbances, anxiety, and existential distress.
The treatment is routine: structured activities, increased social
interaction, limited time near observation ports."

"But?"

Dr. Chen looked at him. "But it's only been three days. The rate of
presentation is accelerating. And the symptoms aren't consistent with
standard sensory deprivation. Standard SD patients know the void is
external. They know it's just empty space. These patients are describing
something different. They're saying the void is not outside the ship. They're
saying the void is all there is. That the ship and everything in it is
an... interruption. A temporary interruption in an emptiness that extends
in every direction, including inward. Including into themselves."

"They're describing a loss of ontological certainty," Father Reyes said.

"A loss of what?"

"The certainty that things exist. That they exist. The stars were proof,
Dr. Chen. We looked out the window and we saw light, and the light told us
that the universe was there, that it was real, that we were part of
something. Take away the stars and you take away the proof."

"You're saying this is a crisis of faith?"

"I'm saying this is a crisis of evidence. Most people don't realize that
their basic sense of reality is maintained by constant sensory confirmation.
The ground under their feet. The sky above their heads. The stars in the
night. Remove those confirmations and the mind begins to ask a question
it has never had to ask before: what if there is nothing?"

Dr. Chen was quiet for a moment. "Can you help?"

"I can try."

                              * * *

Father Reyes began making rounds.

He walked the decks of the Exodus as he had walked the wards of hospitals
and the streets of parishes for thirty years, with his hands clasped behind
his back and his ears open. He stopped where people gathered. He sat where
people sat alone. He did not preach. He did not offer unsolicited comfort.
He simply made himself present, which was, he had learned, the most useful
thing a priest could do.

On Deck Seven, he found Engineer's Mate Rebecca Osei sitting on the floor
in front of an observation port, staring into the darkness. She was
twenty-four years old, from Accra, and she had, in the five months Father
Reyes had known her, struck him as one of the most grounded and capable
people aboard.

"Rebecca."

"Father." She did not look at him. "Do you see it?"

He looked through the port. He saw nothing. That was, of course, the point.
"I see darkness."

"No. Not darkness. Darkness is the absence of light. This is the absence
of... of the thing that light proves." She pressed her hand against the
glass. "When I was small, in Accra, I would lie on my back in my
grandmother's yard and look at the stars. She told me that each star was
a place. A real place, with its own light and its own worlds. And I
believed her, and I grew up, and I came here, to go to one of those places.
But now --" She pulled her hand from the glass. "What if she was wrong?
What if the stars were just... a display? A projection on the inside of a
shell? And now we've gone past the shell, and there's nothing outside it?"

"That's a very old idea," Father Reyes said. He sat down beside her on the
floor. His knees protested; he ignored them. "The ancients believed the
stars were fixed to a celestial sphere. A shell, as you say. Beyond the
shell, they imagined various things: the realm of God, the Empyrean, the
primum mobile. They were not frightened by the idea. They found it
comforting."

"Because they believed something was beyond the shell."

"Yes."

"And what do you believe, Father? What's beyond... this?" She gestured at
the port.

Father Reyes looked into the darkness. He looked at it honestly, as he had
been trained to look at things -- by his seminary professors, by his
parishioners, by the accumulated weight of thirty years of other people's
pain and doubt and hope. He looked at the void and he allowed it to look
back at him.

"I believe," he said, slowly, "that I don't know. And I believe that not
knowing is not the same as not being."

"That's not very reassuring."

"No. It isn't. But it's honest." He paused. "Rebecca, when you were a
child in your grandmother's yard, and you looked at the stars -- did you
believe they were real because you could see them? Or did you believe they
were real because your grandmother told you they were?"

She thought about this. "Both, I suppose."

"And if you hadn't been able to see them? If the sky had been cloudy?
Would you have stopped believing they were there?"

"No. But clouds are different. You know the stars are behind them."

"How do you know?"

"Because... because they're always there. They don't go away."

"Have you considered that they might still be there? That we might simply
have moved to a place where they can't be seen? Not because they've ceased
to exist, but because the medium between us and them has changed?"

Rebecca turned and looked at him. "You're comparing this void to a cloud."

"I'm comparing it to faith." He smiled. "The fundamental condition of
belief is that you maintain it in the absence of evidence. Not because
evidence doesn't matter, but because some truths persist regardless of
whether they can be observed at any given moment. The stars are there,
Rebecca. We passed them on our way here. We will pass them again on our
way out. This void is not the universe. It is a space within the universe.
And spaces, however empty, are still contained by something larger."

She was quiet for a long time. Then she said: "And if they're not? If we
come out the other side and there's still nothing?"

"Then we will deal with that when we arrive. Borrowing despair from
tomorrow is poor economics."

She almost smiled. Not quite. But almost.

                              * * *

On the eighth day, the ship's philosopher -- Dr. James Whitfield, a
secular humanist who occupied the cabin next to Father Reyes's and who
had spent the first five months of the voyage in a state of friendly
intellectual warfare with the chaplain -- knocked on Father Reyes's door.

"Dominic. I need a drink."

"I have communion wine."

"That'll do."

They sat in Father Reyes's small cabin and drank wine from ceramic cups.
Dr. Whitfield was a tall, angular man with a shock of white hair and the
permanently skeptical expression of someone who had spent forty years
teaching epistemology to undergraduates.

"My students are losing their minds," Whitfield said. He ran a philosophy
seminar as part of the ship's educational program. "Not metaphorically.
Literally. I had a young woman in class today who asked me to prove that
she exists. Not as a thought experiment. As an actual request. She wanted
evidence."

"What did you tell her?"

"I told her Descartes's cogito. 'I think, therefore I am.' She said, 'But
what if I'm not thinking? What if thinking is just something the void does
to itself?' And I..." Whitfield took a long drink of wine. "I didn't have
an answer. For the first time in forty years of philosophy, I didn't have
an answer."

"Perhaps that's not a failure."

"Of course it's a failure. I'm a philosopher. Answers are my job."

"I would have said questions were your job."

Whitfield looked at him. "Don't get pastoral with me, Dominic."

"I'm always pastoral. It's a professional hazard." Father Reyes refilled
their cups. "James, what are you actually afraid of?"

Whitfield was quiet for a long moment. "That she's right. That the void
isn't out there. That it's the default state. That all of this --" he
gestured at the cabin, the ship, the wine, himself -- "is a temporary
anomaly. A brief perturbation in an infinite emptiness. And that when we
stop -- when the perturbation ends -- there's nothing. Not even nothing.
Just..." He waved his hand vaguely. "The absence of the question."

"You're describing nihilism."

"I'm describing what I see when I look out the window."

"No," Father Reyes said gently. "You're describing what you feel when you
look out the window. What you see is darkness. What you feel is the
absence of the things you relied upon to feel otherwise."

"And what do you feel, Father? When you look into your God's creation and
find it empty?"

It was the question Father Reyes had been waiting for. Not from Whitfield
specifically, but from someone. From anyone. Because it was the question he
had been asking himself, alone in his cabin at night, kneeling on the hard
deck plating with his hands clasped and his eyes closed, trying to pray
into a silence that returned nothing.

"I feel afraid," he said.

Whitfield looked at him with genuine surprise.

"I feel afraid," Father Reyes continued, "and I feel the absence of God,
and I feel the temptation to despair. And I resist it. Not because I have
evidence that I am right to resist it, but because despair is a choice,
and I refuse to make it."

"That's stubbornness, not faith."

"Perhaps they are more closely related than you think." He drank his wine.
"James, in all your years of philosophy, have you ever found a proof of
meaning? A logical, airtight, irrefutable demonstration that life matters?"

"No."

"Neither have I. Neither has any theologian. Neither has any mystic. And
yet humans have gone on living, and making, and loving, and building ships
to carry them between the stars, without that proof. We don't act as though
life is meaningless. We act as though it matters enormously. And perhaps
that action is itself the proof. Not a proof of God or of cosmic purpose
or of any metaphysical proposition. But a proof that the human response to
the void is not capitulation. It's creation."

"You sound more like a humanist than a priest."

"Perhaps I am both tonight. The wine is quite good, isn't it? I've been
saving it."

Whitfield almost laughed. "You're impossible, Dominic."

"I've heard that before. Usually in confession."

                              * * *

On the twelfth day, a woman named Priya Sharma came to Father Reyes's
alcove. She was not Catholic. She was not, as far as Father Reyes knew,
anything in particular, religiously speaking. She was a botanist,
thirty-one years old, who tended the hydroponic gardens on Deck Three
and who had, on three previous occasions, politely declined Father Reyes's
invitations to Mass.

"I don't believe in God," she said, sitting down on the other side of
the curtain.

"That's all right. This isn't a test."

"I don't believe in any of it. The soul, the afterlife, the cosmic plan.
I believe in photosynthesis and cellular biology and the periodic table."

"All admirable things."

"But I can't sleep. I lie in my bunk and I close my eyes and I can't tell
the difference between my eyelids and the window. The darkness is the same.
Inside, outside -- the same. And I keep thinking: what if there is no
difference? What if consciousness is just the universe briefly noticing
itself, and the void is the universe in its natural state -- unnoticed,
unobserved, unaware? What if we're the anomaly, Father?"

"You're the second person to use that word this week."

"And what did you tell the first?"

"That anomalies are real, too. Perhaps more real than the norm, because
they are rarer and therefore more remarkable."

Priya was silent. Then: "My plants are dying."

"I'm sorry?"

"Not dying. Wilting. There's nothing wrong with the hydroponics -- the
light, the nutrients, the water, everything is the same. But they know.
Plants orient toward light. They grow toward the sun, even when the sun
is artificial. But there's no sun out there anymore. No star to orient
toward, even symbolically. And I think -- this is crazy, I know -- but I
think they can feel it. The absence. The same way we can."

Father Reyes considered this. "Perhaps it's not the plants that are
wilting. Perhaps it's the gardener."

Another silence. "I want to believe in something, Father. Not God. I'm
sorry, but not God. But something. Anything. Some reason to keep the lights
on and the water flowing and the seeds planted. Because right now, in the
dark, I can't find one."

"Then let me offer you this," Father Reyes said. "Not faith. Not God. Just
an observation. You came here, to this alcove, to talk to a priest you
don't believe in about a God you don't worship, because your plants are
wilting. You came because you care about your plants. You came because the
thought of them dying distresses you. And that distress -- that care, that
love for a collection of green, growing things in the belly of a ship in
the middle of nothing -- that is your something. That is your reason. You
don't need the stars to love your garden, Priya. You don't need evidence
of cosmic meaning to water a seed. The meaning is in the watering."

She was quiet for so long that Father Reyes thought she might have left.
Then he heard her draw a breath that shook slightly at the edges.

"Thank you, Father."

"Go tend your garden."

"I will."

She left. Father Reyes sat in his alcove and pressed his palms together
and prayed. He prayed into the silence and the darkness and the terrible,
encompassing absence, and his prayer was not a request but an act of
defiance: I am here. I speak. I believe that my speaking matters, even if
no one is listening. Especially if no one is listening. Because the act of
faith is not the expectation of an answer. It is the willingness to ask.

                              * * *

On the nineteenth day, the stars came back.

It happened at 0347 hours, and the first person to see it was a young
ensign on the night watch who later reported that she had screamed, though
she preferred the word "exclaimed." A point of light appeared at the edge
of the forward viewport. Then another. Then a dozen, a hundred, a thousand --
the sky flooding with light like a dam bursting, the stars pouring back
into existence with a profusion that seemed almost excessive, as though the
universe were apologizing for its absence.

Father Reyes was asleep when the announcement came. He woke to the sound
of cheering that rang through the decks like a hymn, a raw and joyful
noise that no liturgy could improve upon. He dressed and made his way to
Deck Seven, where the observation ports were crowded with people -- weeping,
laughing, pressing their faces to the glass to drink in the light.

He found a quiet spot at the edge of the crowd. He looked out at the stars.

They were, he thought, exactly as they had always been. Indifferent.
Enormous. Utterly without regard for the small, warm, terrified creatures
who had spent nineteen days in the dark. The universe had not reassured
them. It had simply continued. The void had been real, and the stars
beyond it had been real, and neither cared one way or the other about the
people of the Exodus.

And yet.

Father Reyes felt tears on his face. He did not wipe them away. He was a
priest, and priests were allowed to weep when the light returned, because
the return of light was the oldest story his tradition knew, and it never
lost its power, no matter how many times it was told.

Dr. Whitfield appeared beside him. They stood together in silence, watching
the stars.

"Well," Whitfield said. "They were there after all."

"Yes."

"I suppose you'll take credit for that. You and your God."

Father Reyes shook his head. "God doesn't need my credit. And the stars
don't need my faith. They were there whether I believed in them or not."

"Then what was the point of all that faith? All those conversations, all
those sleepless nights?"

Father Reyes looked at him. "The faith was never about the stars, James.
The faith was about us. About whether we could endure the darkness without
becoming darkness ourselves. About whether we could keep the lights on
inside when everything outside was black."

"And could we?"

Father Reyes looked at the crowd. At Rebecca Osei, who was crying and
laughing simultaneously. At Priya Sharma, who was holding a small potted
seedling up to the observation port as though introducing it to the sky.
At the three thousand souls who had passed through the void and come out
the other side, battered and shaken and profoundly, desperately alive.

"We did," he said. "Imperfectly. Clumsily. With doubt and fear and far
too little sleep. But we did."

Whitfield nodded. He looked as though he wanted to say something else --
something philosophical, something that would reassert the primacy of
reason over faith. But he didn't. He just stood beside the priest and
watched the stars, and for once, the silence between them was not a gap
but a bridge.

Father Reyes made the sign of the cross. Not for the stars. Not for God.
For the people. For the fragile, stubborn, foolish, magnificent people who
had stared into the void and refused to stop asking questions.

He went to the chapel. He lit a candle. He knelt.

And in the silence -- a silence that was, for the first time in nineteen
days, a silence within a universe that glittered with light -- he prayed.

Not because he had to. Because he wanted to.

It was, he reflected, the only honest prayer there was.

                         --- END ---

================================================================================
                       EUROPA BONES
                        by Theodore Cain
================================================================================

The ice cracked under Petra Voss's boots like gunshots.

She stopped, checked the ground beneath her, and decided she wasn't going
to die in the next thirty seconds. That was about as far ahead as you
could plan on Europa. The ice was always shifting, always groaning, always
threatening to open up and swallow you into the black ocean two kilometers
below. You learned to think in thirty-second increments or you didn't
last long.

"Voss, you copy?" The voice in her helmet was Dale Krieger, her team
lead, broadcasting from the habitat module a half-klick behind her.

"Copy. Ice is stable. Moving to grid marker seven."

"Roger. Brannigan's team is already at grid nine. They've got their drills
running."

Petra swore under her breath. Charlie Brannigan and his crew from Helios
Mining had been one step ahead of them since they'd touched down three
weeks ago. The race for Europa's first mineral claim was supposed to be
orderly -- the Jovian Resource Authority had divided the survey zone into
numbered grids, assigned landing windows, established protocols. But
protocols didn't mean much when there were fortunes at stake. Brannigan's
crew ran fast, cut corners, and filed claims like they were playing cards.

Petra's outfit, Deepwell Prospecting, was smaller, slower, and more
careful. Dale Krieger was a by-the-book geologist who insisted on full
spectral analysis before driving a single drill. This made him an excellent
scientist and a terrible competitor. Petra, the team's field surveyor, was
the one who had to make up the difference with her boots and her instincts.

She reached grid marker seven and planted her survey beacon. The beacon
sank its anchor pins into the ice and began transmitting subsurface sonar
pulses. Petra watched the data scroll across her helmet display.

The readings were unusual.

"Dale, you seeing this?"

"I see it. Dense subsurface deposits, starting at about four hundred meters
depth. High mineral content. Calcium, silica, trace metals..." A pause.
"That's strange. The structure is regular. Too regular for geological
formation."

"What do you mean, too regular?"

"I mean it looks organized. Patterned. Like crystals, but not any crystal
structure I've seen. Run the deep scan."

Petra activated the full-spectrum subsurface scanner. The device hummed
against the ice, sending penetrating waves deep into Europa's frozen crust.
The data came back in layers: ice, compressed ice, slush, and then -- at
four hundred and twelve meters -- something else.

A stratum of dense material, fifteen meters thick, extending in every
direction as far as the scanner could reach. It wasn't rock. It wasn't
mineral deposit in any conventional sense. It was structured.
Architecturally structured. Repeating units of calcified matter arranged
in patterns that suggested growth, organization, purpose.

"Dale," Petra said, very carefully. "I think these deposits are biological."

Silence on the channel.

"Say again?"

"Biological. Or they were. These look like fossils. Calcified organic
remains. Something lived down here, Dale. Something lived down here and
it died and it mineralized and now it's the thing we came to dig up."

More silence. Then: "Get back to the habitat. Now. We need to talk about
this before anyone else finds out."

Petra pulled her beacon and headed back across the ice. Behind her, a
kilometer to the east, she could see the floodlights of Brannigan's drill
site, bright against the perpetual twilight of Europa's surface. Jupiter
hung overhead, a bloated giant filling a quarter of the sky, its bands of
amber and cream churning with storms older than human civilization.

She walked fast.

                              * * *

In the habitat module, Dale Krieger spread the scan data across the
table -- a holographic display that filled the small briefing room with
translucent layers of subsurface geology. The rest of the Deepwell team
was there: Yuki Tanaka, their chemist; Obi Adeyemi, their drill operator;
and Petra.

"Here," Dale said, pointing to the dense layer. "Four hundred meters down.
Fifteen meters thick. It's everywhere in our survey zone and probably
extends well beyond it." He zoomed in. The structure resolved into
repeating units -- elongated, tapered, with internal chambers and
branching extensions. "These are organisms. Or they were. Calcified,
mineralized, compressed by four hundred meters of ice. But unmistakably
biological."

"How old?" Yuki asked.

"Without core samples, I can't date them precisely. But based on ice
accumulation rates, we're talking millions of years. Maybe tens of
millions."

"And the mineral content?" Obi said. He was a practical man who had come
to Europa to drill, and he was trying to anchor the conversation to
something he could understand.

"High. Extremely high. These organisms concentrated minerals from the
ocean as part of their biology -- the way coral on Earth builds calcium
carbonate reefs. Except these creatures were concentrating rare-earth
elements, platinum-group metals, and a silicate compound I've never seen
before. The deposit we came here to mine isn't a deposit. It's a graveyard."

The room was quiet.

"So what do we do?" Petra asked.

"We report it. To the Jovian Resource Authority, to Earth, to everyone.
This is the first evidence of extraterrestrial life ever discovered. It
changes everything."

"It changes our bottom line is what it changes," Obi said. "Deepwell put
everything into this expedition. If we can't file a claim --"

"We can't file a claim on a species," Dale said.

"They're dead. They've been dead for millions of years. They're rocks now,
Dale. Valuable rocks."

"They're fossils. They're the remains of living beings. You can't mine
them."

"Watch me," Obi said. Then he caught himself. He looked at the faces around
the table and the heat went out of him. "Sorry. I'm sorry. I know what
this is. I know it's important. But I've got a family back on Ganymede
Station and a contract that says I get paid when we file a claim, not when
we make a scientific discovery."

"I understand," Dale said. "But we have to do the right thing here."

"And what's the right thing? Because from where I'm sitting, the right
thing and the profitable thing are in different solar systems."

Petra held up her hand. "Before we decide anything, we need to know if
Brannigan has found the same thing."

They looked at each other. The same thought occurred to all of them at
once: Brannigan's drills were already running.

                              * * *

Petra suited up and crossed the ice to the Helios Mining camp. It was
larger than Deepwell's -- three habitat modules connected by pressurized
tunnels, with a drill platform the size of a basketball court. The drills
were indeed running, their deep vibration carried through the ice like a
heartbeat.

Charlie Brannigan met her at the airlock. He was a big man, red-faced,
with the blunt confidence of someone who had spent twenty years extracting
value from places that didn't want to give it up.

"Voss. What brings you to the competition?"

"We need to talk, Charlie."

"About what? If this is about grid nine, we filed first and you know it."

"It's not about the grid. It's about what's under it."

She showed him the data. She showed him the scans, the structural analysis,
the biological interpretation. She showed him the fossils.

Brannigan looked at it all. He was quiet for longer than Petra expected.
Then he said: "We hit the same layer an hour ago."

"And?"

"And I told my team to keep drilling."

"Charlie --"

"I know what it looks like, Voss. I can see the structures. And yeah, maybe
they used to be alive. A million years ago. Ten million. Now they're
minerals. And minerals are what I'm here for."

"They're the remains of a species. The first alien species ever discovered."

"They're the remains of something that lived in an ocean under a frozen
moon a billion miles from anyone who gives a damn. Nobody is going to cry
over fossils, Voss. Not when there are platinum-group metals to be had."

"I might."

Brannigan looked at her. Something shifted in his expression -- not
softness, exactly, but a recognition that the conversation had moved into
territory that his usual bluster couldn't navigate.

"What do you want me to do?" he asked.

"Stop drilling. Report the find. Let the scientists figure out what we're
dealing with before we start grinding it up."

"And my contract? My crew? We've got eighteen people here, Voss, every one
of them depending on a payout that only happens if we bring up minerals."

"I know."

"Do you? Because you Deepwell folks can afford to be principled. Your
outfit is small. Your overhead is low. I've got loans, Voss. I've got
creditors on Ganymede who will strip my ship if I come back empty."

"So the dead don't matter because you've got debts?"

The words hit harder than she'd intended. Brannigan's face went red, then
pale. He looked away, out through the habitat window at the ice field,
where his drills were even now biting deeper into the frozen remains of
creatures that had lived and died in Europa's dark ocean long before
humanity had learned to walk upright.

"That's not fair," he said quietly.

"No," Petra agreed. "None of this is fair."

They stood in silence. Jupiter turned slowly above them, indifferent and
enormous.

"Twenty-four hours," Brannigan said. "I'll stop drilling for twenty-four
hours. You get your report filed. If the JRA says we can mine, we mine.
If they say we can't..." He trailed off. "Twenty-four hours, Voss. That's
what I can give you."

"That's enough. Thank you, Charlie."

She left. Behind her, one by one, the drills fell silent.

                              * * *

The message took thirty-seven minutes to reach the Jovian Resource
Authority station on Ganymede. The response took considerably longer --
not because of the speed of light, but because the bureaucrats at the JRA
had to read the report, reread it, argue about it, consult with three
different legal departments, and then argue some more.

While they waited, Petra went back to grid marker seven. She stood on the
ice above the fossil layer and tried to imagine what was beneath her feet.

Creatures. Alien creatures, shaped by pressures and environments that no
human mind had ever experienced. Living in the dark ocean beneath the ice,
warmed by Europa's tidal heating, fed by chemicals venting from the sea
floor. Building their bodies from the minerals in the water, growing,
reproducing, dying. Layer upon layer, generation upon generation, until
the ocean cooled or the vents failed or some other catastrophe intervened,
and they died. All of them. Every last one.

And then the ice came, and the weight of it compressed them, and time
turned their bodies to stone, and the stone concentrated their minerals
into deposits so rich that humans traveled a billion miles to dig them up.

Who were they? What had they looked like? Had they been simple organisms --
the equivalent of coral, mindlessly accumulating? Or had they been
complex? Had they thought? Had they communicated? Had they looked up
through the ice and wondered about the faint, distant light of a sun they
could barely see?

She would never know. No one would ever know. The fossils could tell you
about structure and chemistry and age. They could not tell you about
experience. Whatever these creatures had been, whatever they had felt or
thought or wanted, it was gone. Compressed into fifteen meters of
mineralized remains beneath four hundred meters of ice.

All that was left was the question of what to do with their bodies.

                              * * *

The JRA's response arrived eighteen hours later. It was, in the manner of
all bureaucratic communications, both longer and less clear than the
situation demanded. But the essential directive was this: all mining
operations in the survey zone were to be suspended pending a full scientific
assessment. A research team would be dispatched from Ganymede within two
weeks. The fossil deposits were to be treated as a protected xenobiological
site under Article 14 of the Outer Worlds Resource Treaty.

No mining claims would be honored. No mineral extraction would be
permitted. The deposits -- the graveyard, the remains, whatever you chose
to call them -- were not property. They were heritage. The heritage of a
species that could no longer speak for itself, held in trust by a species
that was only beginning to understand the weight of that responsibility.

Brannigan took the news in his habitat's common room, surrounded by his
crew. Petra was there. She had felt she owed him that much.

"So that's it," Brannigan said. "We came a billion miles to dig up rocks
and the rocks turn out to be people."

"Not people," Yuki Tanaka said. She had come along at Petra's request.
"Not people the way we understand people. But living beings. Complex
organisms with structured biology and concentrated mineral processing that
suggests coordinated behavior. We may be looking at the remains of an
ecosystem. A civilization might be too strong a word, but --"

"A civilization," Brannigan repeated. He said it flatly, without
inflection, as though testing the weight of the word. Then he looked at
Petra. "You knew. When you came over here. You knew the JRA would shut
us down."

"I suspected."

"And you came anyway."

"Because you deserved to hear it from a person, not a bureaucratic
transmission."

Brannigan was quiet for a long time. His crew watched him. They were
miners -- hard, practical people who had signed on for a job and were now
being told the job didn't exist. Some of them looked angry. Some looked
lost. One woman in the back, a drill operator named Kask, was staring at
the floor with an expression that Petra recognized as the particular
desolation of someone whose financial future has just evaporated.

"All right," Brannigan said. "All right." He stood up. He was a big man,
and when he stood, he filled the room. "Listen up. We came here to mine.
We're not going to mine. That's the deal and I'm not going to fight it.
But we're not going home empty, either. The JRA wants a scientific
assessment. That takes people on the ground. Drill operators, surveyors,
ice specialists -- that's us. I'm going to volunteer our crew for the
assessment team. We'll work for science wages instead of mining shares.
It's less money. A lot less. But it's something."

"Charlie," one of his crew said, "science wages won't cover our loans."

"I know. But breaking up fossils so we can sell them won't sit right
either. Not now that I know what they are." He looked around the room.
"Anyone disagree?"

No one spoke.

"Good. Voss, tell your boss we're in. Deepwell and Helios, working
together." He extended his hand. "For the dead."

Petra shook it. "For the dead."

It wasn't enough. It wasn't fair. The dead of Europa didn't care about
mining claims or resource treaties or the financial anxieties of the living.
They were beyond all of it, compressed into stone beneath the ice,
indifferent and ancient and utterly, permanently silent.

But the living had chosen to listen anyway. And that, Petra thought, as she
walked back across the groaning ice under Jupiter's vast and careless eye,
was perhaps the most human thing they could have done.

================================================================================
                    MOONRISE OVER VALERIA
                      by Cordell Beaumont
================================================================================

The three moons of Valeria have names that no human tongue can properly
pronounce, for they were named by the Arkelai, who shaped their syllables
with four-lobed palates and tongues of cartilage, and who are now as dead
as the lowland cities they built in the shadow of the tides. The colonial
administration, lacking the anatomical prerequisites for Arkelai phonetics,
had assigned the moons the designations Primus, Secundus, and Tertia,
which possessed all the poetry of a tax form and none of the reverence
that the originals had carried. Lira Kael, who was twenty-four years old
and the youngest cartographer in the Valerian Survey Corps, called them
by their Arkelai names anyway, or the closest approximation her merely
bilateral mouth could manage: Ool, Vashet, and Krin.

She stood now on the eastern rim of Mount Tessara, five thousand meters
above the flood plains, and watched Ool rise above the horizon. It was
enormous -- three times the apparent diameter of Earth's moon, the color
of bruised copper, its surface scarred with impact craters that caught
the light of Valeria's sun and flared like scattered coins. As it climbed,
the plain below her began to change. The sea, which at low tide was a
distant silver ribbon on the flatlands thirty kilometers away, began to
swell. She could see it through her survey scope: a dark line advancing
across the plain, consuming the mudflats, the salt marshes, the ruins.

Always the ruins.

"Kael, what's your status?" The voice belonged to Director Emmon Trave,
transmitted from the Survey Corps station on the summit of Mount Tessara,
two kilometers behind and above her. Trave was her superior, her mentor,
and, at this particular moment, the person most likely to prevent her from
doing something extraordinarily foolish.

"I'm at Observation Point East. Ool is rising. The tide's coming in."

"I can see that from here. The advance rate is consistent with the models.
The triple alignment is in six hours. You need to be back at the station
before then."

"I know."

"Kael."

"I know, Director."

She did know. The triple alignment -- the convergence of Ool, Vashet, and
Krin in a single arc of the Valerian sky -- occurred once every 142 local
years. When it happened, the combined gravitational influence of the three
moons would produce a tide of such magnitude that the flood plains below
would be submerged beneath two hundred meters of ocean. Everything below
the three-thousand-meter elevation line would be underwater. The ruins of
the Arkelai lowland cities, normally accessible during the long periods
between major tidal events, would be drowned beyond any possibility of
exploration.

Lira had been waiting for three years for this alignment. Not for the
flood. For the hours before it.

Because in the hours before the triple alignment, when the tidal forces
were building but had not yet peaked, the flood plains experienced a
phenomenon that the Survey Corps had documented but never explained. The
ocean retreated. The tides pulled back farther than at any other time,
exposing portions of the plain that were normally submerged even at the
lowest ebb. Regions that had been underwater for decades were briefly laid
bare, their mud still glistening, their ruins still intact.

For a few hours, the deepest parts of the Arkelai cities would be visible
for the first time in living human memory.

Lira intended to be there.

"Request permission to descend to the flood plain," she said.

The silence from Trave lasted four seconds, which was three seconds longer
than his usual response time and indicated, Lira knew, that he was
composing a refusal that would be both comprehensive and emphatic.

"Denied."

"Director --"

"Kael, the triple-alignment tide will crest in approximately six hours.
The flood plain will be under two hundred meters of water. If you descend
to the plain, you will have -- at most -- a four-hour window before the
ocean returns. That is not enough time to reach the deep ruins, conduct a
survey, and return to safe elevation."

"It's enough time if I take the eastern descent route and use the
survey sled."

"The survey sled has a maximum speed of forty kilometers per hour on
flat terrain. The deep ruins are fifty-two kilometers from the base of
the eastern descent. That's a minimum of seventy-eight minutes each way.
You'd have less than two hours on site."

"Two hours is more than anyone has ever had. The deep ruins have been
underwater for a hundred and forty-two years. No one alive has seen them.
No one has mapped them. We don't even know what's there."

"And that is precisely why I'm not sending you. We don't know what's
there. The terrain is unmapped, the conditions are unpredictable, and if
you miscalculate the tidal return by even fifteen minutes, you will drown
in an alien ocean on an alien world, and I will have to explain to the
Colonial Administration why I let my best cartographer commit suicide by
moon."

"I'm your only cartographer."

"Which makes your survival even more relevant."

Lira looked through her scope at the receding waterline. The plain was
emerging from the sea like a body rising from a bath: glistening, dark,
stippled with pools of trapped water that caught the sunlight and threw
it back in shards of white and gold. She could see the upper structures
of the Arkelai ruins -- the spires and arches that were visible during
normal low tides, their mineral-encrusted surfaces gleaming with the
organic tracery of a hundred and forty-two years of marine growth. But
beyond them, farther out on the plain, where the water was still
retreating, she could see shapes she had never seen before. Lower
structures. Broader. Geometries that did not match anything in the Survey
Corps database.

The deep ruins. Emerging.

"Director," she said, "I'm going."

"Kael, I am ordering you --"

"I heard your order. I'm going anyway. You can court-martial me when I
get back."

She switched off her communicator, shouldered her survey pack, and began
the descent.

                              * * *

The eastern face of Mount Tessara dropped away in a series of terraced
cliffs that the Arkelai had carved into switchback paths, wide enough for
their broad, six-limbed bodies, narrow and precarious for a human. Lira
descended quickly, her boots finding purchase on steps worn smooth by
millennia of use and decades of tidal erosion. The air changed as she
dropped below the cloud line: warmer, thicker, heavy with the salt-and-
mineral smell of the receding ocean. Valeria's atmosphere was breathable
but rich -- higher oxygen content than Earth standard, laced with trace
compounds that gave it a faintly metallic taste, like copper on the tongue.

She reached the base of the mountain in forty minutes. The flood plain
stretched before her, vast and shining, a landscape revealed and already
doomed. The mud was dark, almost black, veined with mineral deposits that
caught the light in threads of silver and gold. Pools of trapped seawater
dotted the terrain, ranging from puddles to small lakes, their surfaces
still and mirror-bright. And scattered across the plain, emerging from the
mud like the bones of the earth, were the ruins.

She had seen the upper ruins before, during standard low-tide surveys.
The Arkelai had built in stone and mineral-cement, materials that resisted
the tidal erosion with remarkable tenacity. Their architecture was
characterized by flowing, organic curves -- arches that spiraled like
nautilus shells, spires that tapered to points so fine they seemed to
dissolve into the air, walls that undulated in sinusoidal waves as though
the builders had been sculpting the wind. Everything was encrusted with
the residue of long submersion: colonies of bioluminescent organisms that
glowed faintly in the shadow of the structures, mineral deposits that had
painted the stone in layers of iridescent color, marine growths that
draped the arches like curtains of living lace.

But the deep ruins were different.

Lira activated the survey sled -- a flat, hovering platform the size of a
dining table, equipped with mapping sensors and a modest propulsion system --
and set out across the plain. The sled hummed beneath her, skimming half
a meter above the mud, leaving no tracks. She was moving fast, faster than
prudence warranted, her eyes scanning the terrain ahead for obstacles while
her instruments recorded everything: topography, structural density,
mineral composition, bioluminescent spectra.

The upper ruins fell behind. She passed through a zone of salt marshes,
the mud giving way to a lattice of dried channels and raised banks where
marine vegetation had taken root and died in the air. The smell here was
intense -- organic decay, salt, the sharp ozone tang of exposed mineral
deposits reacting with the atmosphere. Small creatures skittered in the
channels: crustacean-like organisms, their shells the color of dark jade,
fleeing the unfamiliar exposure of air and light.

And then the deep ruins rose before her.

Lira stopped the sled. She stood on the platform and looked.

The structures were massive. She had expected more of the same -- spires
and arches, organic curves, the architectural vocabulary of the upper
ruins writ larger. What she saw was something entirely different. The deep
ruins were geometric. Angular. Built of the same mineral-cement as the
upper structures but shaped into forms that defied the flowing aesthetic
she had come to associate with Arkelai construction: cubes, prisms,
hexagonal columns, flat planes intersecting at precise angles. The
surfaces were smooth, unadorned, free of the organic growth that covered
the upper ruins. The water had preserved them -- or perhaps their
construction had resisted the marine encrustation that afflicted the
shallower structures.

They looked, Lira thought, like machines.

She guided the sled into the ruins, moving slowly now, her instruments
recording. The structures formed a grid -- not the organic, flowing layout
of the upper city, but a precise geometric pattern, rows and columns of
identical buildings separated by channels of uniform width. The channels
were dry now, their floors covered in a thin layer of silt, but their
dimensions suggested they had been designed for water flow. The buildings
were connected by overhead structures -- bridges or conduits, she couldn't
tell -- that formed a secondary grid above the first.

At the center of the complex, she found the reservoir.

It was enormous -- a circular basin, three hundred meters in diameter,
carved into the bedrock of the plain. Its walls were lined with the same
smooth mineral-cement, and its floor was covered in a pattern of hexagonal
tiles, each one a meter across, each one inlaid with channels that radiated
from the center like the spokes of a wheel. The channels converged on a
central structure: a column, ten meters tall, carved from a single block
of dark stone that was not mineral-cement but something else -- something
that absorbed light rather than reflecting it, something that felt, when
Lira approached it and laid her hand against its surface, not cold, as
stone should have felt, but warm.

She pulled her hand back. Checked her instruments. The stone was warm.
Measurably warmer than the ambient temperature. And the warmth was not
residual heat from the sun -- it was coming from inside the column.

She scanned the column. The interior was hollow, its walls laced with a
network of channels too fine to see with the naked eye but clearly visible
on her instruments. The channels contained traces of a crystalline compound
that she could not identify -- something that did not appear in the Survey
Corps database, something that was not naturally occurring in Valeria's
geology.

Lira looked at the hexagonal tiles. At the channels radiating from the
column. At the grid of structures surrounding the reservoir. At the conduits
connecting them.

It was a system. Not a city. Not a dwelling place. A system, designed for
a purpose.

She knelt beside one of the radiating channels and used her hand tool to
clear the silt. Beneath the silt, the channel was intact, its walls
polished smooth, its cross-section precisely hexagonal. She followed it
with her eyes, tracing its path from the central column outward through
the reservoir floor, up the wall, and into one of the conduits that
connected to the surrounding structures.

A distribution system. The column at the center, the channels radiating
outward, the conduits connecting to the grid of structures that covered
the surrounding plain. Whatever the crystalline compound was, this system
had been designed to distribute it. From the column to the channels to
the conduits to the structures to --

Lira stood up and looked toward the ocean.

She could see it now, at the edge of her vision -- a dark line on the
horizon, glinting in the light of Ool and the newly risen Vashet. The
tide was coming back. She checked her chronometer: she had been on the
plain for two hours and eighteen minutes. The tidal models gave her
another ninety minutes before the water reached this elevation. Perhaps
less, if the triple alignment was accelerating the return.

She should leave. She knew she should leave. The data she had already
collected was extraordinary -- the deep ruins, the geometric architecture,
the reservoir, the column, the distribution system. It was enough for a
dozen papers, a complete rewrite of the Survey Corps' understanding of
Arkelai civilization. It was enough.

But the channel ran toward the ocean. And the ocean was where the answers
were.

Lira got back on the sled and followed the channel.

                              * * *

The channel ran straight as a ruled line, cutting across the flood plain
toward the retreating waterline. As Lira followed it, she passed through
more ruins -- not the geometric structures of the reservoir complex, but
something else. Pylons. Tall, narrow columns of dark stone, spaced at
regular intervals along the channel's path, each one topped with a
hexagonal platform that faced the sky. Solar collectors, she thought at
first. But the platforms were angled wrong for solar collection -- they
pointed not at the sun but at the sky generally, at the arc of the heavens
where the moons tracked their orbits.

Tidal collectors. The realization struck her with the force of physical
impact. The platforms were oriented toward the moons. The pylons were
positioned along the channel. The channel led to the reservoir. The
reservoir distributed its contents through the conduit grid.

The Arkelai had not merely endured the tides. They had harnessed them.

Whatever the crystalline compound in the column was, the pylons had
generated it -- or charged it, or activated it -- using the gravitational
energy of the moons. The triple alignment, the event that produced the
most catastrophic tides, would also have produced the maximum gravitational
influence on the pylons. The system was designed not for normal conditions
but for the extreme. For the alignment. For the moment of greatest power.

The floods were not natural.

The thought formed clearly and completely in Lira's mind, and she stopped
the sled and sat very still while its implications washed over her.

The floods were not natural. The tides were real -- gravitational physics
was gravitational physics, and three massive moons in alignment would
produce tidal forces regardless of any alien technology. But the scale of
the floods, the catastrophic inundation that drove the surviving Arkelai
to the mountaintops and drowned the lowland civilizations every 142 years --
that was engineered. The pylons amplified the tidal forces. The reservoir
system channeled the energy. The floods were not a natural disaster that
the Arkelai had endured. They were a mechanism that the Arkelai had built.

But why?

Lira looked at the ocean. It was closer now. She could hear it -- a low,
vast sound, like the breathing of something immeasurably large. The dark
line on the horizon had become a visible wall of water, advancing across
the plain, swallowing the salt marshes, the channels, the ruins. She
checked her chronometer. Sixty-two minutes until the water reached her
elevation. Fifty, perhaps, if she was wrong about the rate of advance.

She should turn back.

Instead, she followed the channel to its terminus.

The channel ended at the edge of a cliff -- a natural feature of the
plain's geology, a drop of perhaps thirty meters to a lower shelf that
was normally submerged. The retreating tide had exposed it, and Lira could
see, on the shelf below, a structure that made everything she had
discovered so far look like a prologue.

It was a gate. There was no other word for it. Two massive pillars of dark
stone, thirty meters tall, connected at the top by a hexagonal arch. The
pillars were covered in carvings -- not the smooth, geometric precision
of the deep ruins, but something older, rawer, more expressive. Figures.
Arkelai figures, rendered in a style that combined anatomical precision
with a flowing, almost calligraphic grace. They were depicted in postures
of labor, of ceremony, of what might have been worship. Their six limbs
were arranged in patterns that Lira recognized from the Survey Corps
database as ritual configurations -- poses that appeared in Arkelai art
across multiple sites, always in the context of the moons.

And between the pillars, in the space beneath the arch, the air shimmered.

Not water. Not heat distortion. Something else. A visual disturbance, a
wrongness in the quality of the light, as though the space between the
pillars was not quite connected to the space around them. Lira stared at
it, and the shimmer stared back, and she felt a vertigo that had nothing
to do with the height of the cliff.

She activated her instruments. The readings were chaotic -- electromagnetic
interference, gravitational anomalies, spectral signatures that her
equipment was not designed to measure. The crystalline compound was present
in massive concentrations -- not just in the pillars but in the air between
them, suspended, active, resonating at frequencies that made Lira's teeth
ache.

The gate was active. Even now, with the system unpowered, with the pylons
inert and the reservoir dry, the gate between the pillars held a residual
charge. A ghost of whatever it had once done, still humming in the stone,
waiting for the alignment that would bring it fully to life.

And the alignment was coming. In less than an hour, the three moons would
converge, and the gravitational pulse would flood through the pylons and
the channels and the reservoir, and the gate would --

What? Open? Activate? Connect to something?

The ocean answered her. Not with information but with urgency. She could
see the water on the lower shelf now, creeping across the exposed rock,
reaching for the pillars with silver fingers. The tide was returning faster
than the models predicted. The pylons, even dormant, were amplifying it.

Lira recorded everything. Every sensor, every instrument, every angle.
She spoke a continuous narration into her suit recorder, describing what
she saw, what she measured, what she hypothesized. She worked with the
desperate efficiency of a woman who knows she is running out of time and
that what she is seeing may never be seen again.

The water reached the base of the pillars. The shimmer between them
intensified. Lira felt the sled vibrate beneath her -- a resonance
transmitted through the ground, through the rock, through the ancient
channels that honeycombed the plain. The system was waking up. The tide
was feeding it.

"Time to go," she said aloud. Her voice sounded very small against the
sound of the ocean.

She turned the sled. Behind her, the gate blazed with a light that was
not quite light -- a luminance that had no color, no warmth, no source,
that seemed to emanate from the space between the pillars rather than
from the pillars themselves. The carvings on the stone seemed to move in
that light, the Arkelai figures shifting, processing, their six limbs
raised toward the moons in gestures that could have been supplication or
triumph or both.

Lira ran the sled at full speed across the plain. The ocean followed. She
could hear it behind her, a sound like the end of the world -- the
thunderous, inexorable advance of two hundred meters of salt water driven
by the combined gravity of three moons and amplified by the technology of
a dead civilization. The ruins she had mapped disappeared beneath the
surge. The pylons were swallowed. The reservoir filled, and the system --
dormant for a hundred and forty-two years -- drank deeply.

The mountain rose before her. She abandoned the sled at the base of the
eastern ascent and climbed. The water followed, climbing the switchback
paths carved by Arkelai hands, following her up the terraced cliffs with
a patience that was more terrifying than speed. Lira climbed until her
legs burned and her lungs ached and the copper taste of Valeria's atmosphere
was sharp in her throat. She climbed until she reached the three-thousand-
meter line, and then she climbed higher, because the models were wrong and
the water was still rising.

She reached the four-thousand-meter line as the ocean stabilized below
her. She collapsed on a ledge and lay on her back and gasped and looked
up at the sky.

The three moons hung above her in a perfect arc, Ool and Vashet and Krin,
their surfaces blazing with reflected sunlight, their gravitational
combined influence gripping the planet like a fist. Below her, the flood
plain was gone. The ruins were gone. The gate was gone. Two hundred meters
of dark water covered everything she had seen, and would cover it for
weeks, perhaps months, until the alignment passed and the tides retreated
and the plain emerged once more, glistening and ancient and waiting.

But the data remained. Every scan, every measurement, every word she had
spoken into her recorder. The deep ruins. The reservoir. The distribution
system. The pylons. The gate. The engineered floods, designed not to destroy
the lowland civilization but to power it -- to activate a technology that
required the combined gravitational force of three aligned moons to function.

The Arkelai had not been victims of their world's tidal forces. They had
been masters of them. The floods were not catastrophe. They were the key.
Every 142 years, the alignment came, and the gate opened, and the Arkelai
did -- something. Went somewhere. Connected to something. The ruins on the
mountaintops were not refuges from the flood. They were waiting rooms.
Places to live between the alignments, while the lowland system lay dormant,
waiting for the moons to converge again.

And then the Arkelai had died. Or left. Or transcended. The mountaintop
ruins showed no evidence of violence or catastrophe -- just absence. One
day they had been there; the next, they were gone. And the system they
had built continued to operate, the pylons amplifying the tides on
schedule, the gate activating for no one, the floods washing over empty
cities every 142 years like a clock striking in an abandoned house.

Lira sat up. Her communicator was still off. She switched it on.

"-- Kael! Kael, respond! This is Director Trave, respond immediately --"

"I'm here, Director. I'm at the four-thousand-meter line on the eastern
face. I'm safe."

The silence was volcanic. When Trave spoke again, his voice contained the
particular quality of controlled fury that Lira had learned to recognize
during her three years in his employ.

"You are in more trouble than you can possibly imagine."

"Yes, sir. But you need to hear what I found."

She told him. She told him about the deep ruins and the reservoir and the
pylons and the gate and the shimmer between the pillars and the engineered
floods. She talked for twenty minutes, her voice hoarse from the climb,
her breath still short, her data streaming from her instruments to the
station's servers even as she spoke.

When she finished, Trave was quiet for a long time.

"The gate," he said at last. "You're saying it activated."

"Residually. The full system hasn't functioned in... I don't know how long.
Since the Arkelai disappeared. But the residual charge was enough to produce
a visible effect. If the system were fully operational --"

"If the system were fully operational, the triple alignment would power
a device of unknown function on a scale we can barely comprehend." Another
pause. "Kael, this changes our entire understanding of this world."

"Yes, sir."

"You are still in an extraordinary amount of trouble."

"Yes, sir."

"Come home. We have work to do."

Lira stood. She looked down at the ocean that now covered the plain,
dark and vast and restless, churned by forces that were partly natural
and partly the legacy of a civilization that had learned to write its
will upon the tides. Somewhere beneath that water, the gate stood between
its pillars, and the shimmer danced in the space between them, and the
carvings watched the moons with the patience of the very old and the very
dead.

She looked up. The three moons blazed. Ool, Vashet, Krin. Named by beings
who had grasped them like tools, who had used the very forces that shaped
their world as the power source for something transcendent. Named by
beings who were gone now, leaving behind their cities and their ruins and
their engineered apocalypse, their gift and their mystery, their silence
that was louder than any voice.

Lira began the climb back to the station. The moons lit her way, and
the ocean breathed below her, and somewhere beneath the water, the gate
waited for an alignment that had already come.

The next one would come in 142 years.

Lira intended to be ready.

of the prospecting life to his fiction. He lives in Butte, Montana, with
his wife and two sons, and is at work on a novel set in the asteroid belt.

CORDELL BEAUMONT is a travel writer, amateur geologist, and author of
three science fiction novels, the most recent being "The Tides of Aethra,"
which was serialized in Astounding in 1952. His work is distinguished by
its vivid evocation of alien landscapes and its commitment to scientific
plausibility. He lives in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where the light, he says,
"is the closest thing on Earth to an alien sky."

              SIGNALS RECEIVED — Letters to the Editor
================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I must take issue with Dr. Wainwright's "The Cartesian Mirror" from your
February issue. While the story was beautifully written, his premise that
a sufficiently advanced computing machine could achieve genuine
self-awareness strikes me as philosophically untenable. Consciousness is not
a matter of complexity but of kind. A machine, no matter how sophisticated,
processes information; it does not experience it. I say this with great
respect for Dr. Wainwright's talents, but on this point, he is building
castles on sand.

    — Prof. Herbert Dalton, Princeton, NJ

[Editor's note: Dr. Wainwright's "Replicant's Garden" in this issue may
be read as his response to your objection, Professor. We suspect you will
find it even more provocative than "The Cartesian Mirror." Letters of
outrage may be directed to the usual address.]

Dear Editor,

Col. Stanton's "The Long Patrol" (March issue) was the finest military
science fiction I have read in any magazine, period. The man writes
combat like he's been there — which, of course, he has. More, please.

    — Sgt. William R. Torres (Ret.), San Antonio, TX

[Editor's note: Ask and receive, Sergeant. The Colonel returns this month
with "Weapons Free," which may be his most surprising story yet.]

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am fourteen years old and I have read every issue of Tales from the
Future and Beyond since the first one. My mother says science fiction will
rot my brain. My father says it's better than the crime magazines. I say
it's the best thing in the mailbox every month. Please don't ever stop.

    — Danny Kowalski, Westfield, NJ

[Editor's note: Danny, your letter made my day. With a name like Kowalski
and an address in Westfield, I think you'll find Mr. Pemberton's story in
this issue particularly interesting. Tell your mother that science fiction
built the atomic age, and we're just getting started. — M.S.]

Dear Sterling,

Beaumont's "The Amber Meridian" in Issue #2 was overwritten, overwrought,
and approximately 2,000 words too long. I counted four uses of the word
"iridescent" in a single paragraph. Has the man never met an adjective he
didn't like?

    — Richard Crane, Chicago, IL

[Editor's note: Mr. Beaumont has returned in this issue with a story set
on a world of three moons, and I regret to inform you, Mr. Crane, that
he has not reduced his adjective consumption. In fact, I believe he has
increased it. I suggest you read it anyway. You might discover that some
stories require more color than others. — M.S.]

Dear Editor,

Miss Crenshaw's time-travel stories are the most fun I've had reading
science fiction since Fredric Brown. But I have a question: if Frank
Costello keeps changing the past, how does he remember the original
timeline? Doesn't the paradox erase his memories along with everything
else?

    — Alice Yamamoto, Berkeley, CA

[Editor's note: Miss Crenshaw assures me that Agent Costello's memory is
protected by "standard temporal inoculation procedures," which she will
explain "as soon as she invents them." The real answer, I suspect, is
that the stories are too much fun to burden with that particular logical
difficulty. — M.S.]

            THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW — Book Reviews
================================================================================

CHILDHOOD'S END by Arthur C. Clarke
Ballantine Books, 1953. 214 pages. $2.50.

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Arthur Clarke has done something remarkable with this novel: he has written
a book about the end of humanity that is neither despairing nor triumphant
but simply, quietly, awe-inspiring. When the Overlords arrive above Earth's
cities, Clarke gives us not invasion but supervision -- a benevolent
dictatorship of alien intellect that raises humanity to a golden age before
revealing its true purpose: we are not the end point of evolution but a
larval stage, and our children will become something we cannot comprehend.

The prose is Clarke at his most controlled and luminous. The ideas are
staggering. The emotional impact -- particularly in the final chapters,
as the last human watches the Earth transform -- is unlike anything I have
encountered in science fiction. This is not merely a good novel. It is a
milestone. Every reader of this magazine should own a copy.

Rating: Essential.

THE DEMOLISHED MAN by Alfred Bester
Shasta Publishers, 1953. 250 pages. $3.00.

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

If Clarke writes science fiction with the cool precision of a telescope,
Bester writes it with the manic energy of a fireworks display. "The
Demolished Man" is a murder mystery set in a world of telepaths -- a world
where committing a premeditated crime should be impossible, because the
police can read your mind. Ben Reich, industrialist and killer, attempts
it anyway, and the resulting cat-and-mouse game between Reich and the
telepathic detective Lincoln Powell is as propulsive and inventive as
anything in the genre.

Bester's prose crackles. His typographic experiments -- words arranged in
patterns on the page, telepathic conversations rendered as overlapping
streams of text -- are audacious and surprisingly effective. The novel won
the first Hugo Award, and deservedly so. It is science fiction written at
a dead sprint, and it dares you to keep up.

Rating: Highly recommended.

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953. 233 pages. $2.75.

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Sturgeon's novel about a gestalt organism -- a composite being made of
individual humans whose combined abilities exceed the sum of their parts --
is the most emotionally complex science fiction novel I have read this
year. Where Clarke is cosmic and Bester is kinetic, Sturgeon is intimate.
His characters are broken people -- an idiot, a pair of telekinetic twins,
a teleporting infant, a girl with impossible mental abilities -- who find
in their union not power but wholeness.

The writing is gorgeous. Sturgeon has always been the finest prose stylist
in science fiction, and "More Than Human" is his masterwork. The central
question -- what does it mean to be more than yourself? -- resonates far
beyond the genre. This is a novel about loneliness, connection, and the
terrible, beautiful necessity of other people.

Rating: Essential.

                COMING ATTRACTIONS — Next Month Preview
================================================================================

Issue #5 of TALES FROM THE FUTURE AND BEYOND (May 1953) promises to be our
most ambitious issue yet. We are pleased to announce:

"THE IRON CATHEDRAL" by Arthur Wainwright — A generation ship arrives at its
destination after three hundred years of travel, only to discover that the
passengers have evolved into something the original designers never
intended. Wainwright returns with a novella-length exploration of identity,
adaptation, and the meaning of home.

"SIGNAL LOSS" by Col. James "Buck" Stanton — A deep-space rescue mission
goes silent. When the recovery team arrives, they find the ship intact, the
crew alive, and no one willing to explain what happened. Stanton at his
most unsettling.

"THE PROBABILITY GARDEN" by Phyllis Crenshaw — Agent Frank Costello is
assigned to prevent a paradox at a garden party in 1890s Vienna, where a
young physicist is about to make a discovery that will unmake the twentieth
century. Screwball comedy meets quantum mechanics.

"MERIDIAN" by Cordell Beaumont — On a tidally locked world where one
hemisphere is eternal day and the other eternal night, a cartographer walks
the terminator line and discovers that the boundary between light and dark
is not where the maps say it is.

Plus new stories by Margaret Yun, Dr. Solomon Burke, and a stunning debut
by a writer we are not yet at liberty to name.

Issue #5 arrives on newsstands May 1st. Do not miss it.
