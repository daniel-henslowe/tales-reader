Cover Art: "The Lightless World" by Gerald "Gerry" Pulaski
A vast generation ship hangs in the foreground, its hull scarred by decades
of interstellar travel, observation ports glowing amber against the darkness.
Below it, filling the lower canvas, a rogue planet drifts alone between
the stars — no sun, no system, only a faint bioluminescent glow tracing
the planet's surface like veins beneath dead skin. The black of space is
absolute. Not a single star is near.

TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

Five months in, and I find myself in an editorial position I did not
entirely anticipate. This issue of Tales from the Future and Beyond is,
I confess, a darker one than its predecessors.

I did not plan it that way. An editor assembles an issue the way a
conductor assembles a program — you want contrast, variety, a balance
between the exhilarating and the contemplative. You want your reader to
feel, upon reaching the final page, that they have traveled somewhere and
returned safely home. But the stories that arrived on my desk this month
had other ideas. They arrived carrying shadows, and I found I lacked the
will — and, more honestly, the desire — to turn them away.

Gunnar Eriksson opens our issue with "The Cradle and the Void," a
generation-ship story of uncommon beauty and stillness. Eriksson writes
about deep space the way certain Nordic painters render winter: with vast,
luminous emptiness that is somehow more full of presence than any crowded
canvas. His navigator, Astrid Lund, has never seen a sun. That fact alone
would sustain a lesser story; Eriksson builds from it a meditation on what
we owe to the unknown, and what the unknown may owe to us.

We are also proud to introduce a new voice to our pages. Lucian Marsh
comes to us by way of the British weird fiction tradition — readers of
Doyle's more macabre efforts and of M.R. James will recognize a kindred
sensibility — and his debut for this magazine, "Every Mouth a Rictus," is the
most purely unsettling story we have published. I will say nothing more
about its content. I do not wish to prepare you. The story is most
effective when it arrives without warning, as a knock on the door at three
in the morning is most effective when you are not expecting visitors. I
will note only that my associate editor, Frances Greer, read the
manuscript at her desk, set it down when she had finished, and said
quietly, "Max, I don't think I want to smile for a while." I printed the
story the next day.

Rex Drummond provides the antidote — or at least the adrenaline — with
"Chromium Thunder," a rocket-sled race down the slopes of Olympus Mons
that left me white-knuckled and grinning. Theodore Cain delivers a
courtroom drama of rare intelligence in "Probate of Worlds," a story
that asks who may own a planet and, more pointedly, who may be considered
a person. Dr. Vincent Koslov returns with "Seven Bridges," a cold-war
thriller woven through with the elegant mathematics of topology. And Danny
Kowalski closes our issue with warmth and wonder in "The Boy Who Built the
Sky," reminding us that even in the darkest reaches of space, a child's
curiosity is the most powerful force in the universe.

Six stories. Some will unsettle you. Some will thrill you. One, I hope,
will make you believe again in the simple act of looking up.

A word on our letters column, which has grown gratifyingly robust: keep
writing. We read every letter, and your responses have already shaped the
direction of this magazine in ways both large and small. Several readers
have written to ask about story collections from our contributors — I am
pleased to report that discussions are underway, and I hope to have news
on that front before the year is out.

The darkness, I have found, makes the stars more visible.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling

                       THE CRADLE AND THE VOID

                        by Gunnar Eriksson

================================================================================

                               I.

There were no windows on the Farthest Shore. There had never been windows.

Astrid Lund knew this the way she knew the pitch of the ventilation
system's hum, or the faint metallic taste of recycled water, or the
precise number of steps — forty-seven — between her quarters and the
navigation bay. It was knowledge so deeply embedded in her understanding
of the world that it required no thought. The ship was enclosed. The ship
had always been enclosed. What lay outside was measured, calculated,
inferred. It was not seen.

The telescope saw. The instruments saw. Astrid read what they reported,
and from their data she constructed, in the quiet theater of her mind, an
image of what surrounded them: the interstellar medium, thin as
forgetting, and the stars — thousands upon thousands of them, scattered
across the black like the lights of a city she had never visited and
never would.

She was twenty-six years old. Third generation. Her grandmother, Sigrid
Lund, had been among the original twelve hundred who boarded the
Farthest Shore at the orbital dock above Gothenburg, and Sigrid had seen
the sun. Had felt it on her face. Had closed her eyes against its
brightness and seen the red of her own blood through her eyelids.

Astrid had heard the stories many times. All third-generation children
had. The elders spoke of Earth the way one speaks of the dead: with a
tenderness made formal by distance.

She did not miss the sun. You cannot miss what you have never had. But
she was aware, in a way that she could not fully articulate, of an
absence at the center of her experience. A warmth she had never felt. A
light she had never seen. The ship's illumination was full-spectrum and
carefully calibrated to replicate natural daylight, and it was not the
same, and everyone knew it was not the same, and no one spoke of it.

The navigation bay was quiet. It was always quiet. It was a long,
narrow room on the forward axis of the ship, lined with instrument
consoles and display screens that cast a pale blue light across the
floor. Three navigation officers worked each shift. Astrid was senior
among them — not because of age or experience, but because she had
demonstrated, during her training, an intuitive facility with stellar
cartography that her instructors had described, in their careful,
understated way, as "unusual."

She understood the stars. Not as a physicist understands them — she was
not a physicist — but as a navigator understands a landscape. She could
look at a field of stellar data and perceive, almost immediately, the
shape of the space it described. The clusters and voids. The rivers of
dust. The gravitational architecture of the neighborhood through which
the Farthest Shore moved, slowly and irrevocably, toward a star it would
not reach for another sixty-one years.

Sixty-one years. Astrid would be eighty-seven. She might live to see
the arrival. She might not. It was not, in any case, something she spent
much time considering. The voyage was the voyage. It had its own
rhythms, its own seasons, its own small joys and tediums. You lived
inside it the way you lived inside your own body — without choosing,
without questioning, because there was no alternative and no need for one.

She was reviewing the forward telemetry — routine, methodical, the kind
of work that occupied the hands while the mind drifted — when the
anomaly appeared.

It was subtle. A perturbation in the gravitational data. A slight
irregularity in the trajectory of three distant reference stars,
indicating the presence of a massive body where no massive body had been
catalogued. Astrid frowned. She isolated the data set and ran a
secondary analysis. The perturbation held. She widened the search
parameters and found additional indicators: a faint thermal signature,
barely distinguishable from the cosmic background, and a gravitational
lensing effect that bent the light of a star cluster seventeen light-
years behind the object into a thin, distorted arc.

Something was there.

She set down her stylus and stared at the display. The data described
an object of planetary mass — approximately four times the mass of Earth
— moving through interstellar space at a velocity consistent with
gravitational ejection from a stellar system. A rogue planet. Sunless.
Drifting. Alone in the dark between the stars, as the Farthest Shore was
alone.

Astrid requested a telescopic sweep. The ship's primary telescope — a
three-meter reflecting instrument mounted on the forward hull — took
eleven minutes to reposition and calibrate. She waited. The navigation
bay hummed. Her two colleagues, Piet Janssen and Kara Osei, worked at
their own stations, unaware. The ship moved forward. The stars did not
appear to move at all.

The telescope returned its images. They were dark — almost entirely
dark. The rogue planet was a sphere of blackness against a slightly less
black background, visible only because it occluded the stars behind it.
No reflected light. No atmosphere that the instruments could detect. A
world of stone and ice, frozen through to its core, wandering the galaxy
in absolute solitude.

And yet.

Astrid leaned closer to the display. There, at the edge of the
planet's limb, almost lost in the noise of the data, was something she
had not expected. A faint luminescence. Intermittent. Irregular. Not the
steady glow of geological activity or the uniform signature of reflected
starlight, but something that pulsed. Something that flickered.

Something that looked, if she allowed herself the thought, like life.

                               * * *

She did not report it immediately. She was not sure why. Perhaps because
she wanted to be certain. Perhaps because she understood, with the
instinct of someone who had spent her entire life inside a vessel
governed by consensus and caution, that what she had found would change
things, and that changed things, aboard the Farthest Shore, were
regarded with deep suspicion.

She spent the next four hours refining the data. She ran spectral
analyses of the luminescence and found that it did not match any known
geological or chemical process. She calculated the planet's trajectory
and determined that it would pass within 2.7 astronomical units of the
ship's current course — close, by interstellar standards. Impossibly
close. The kind of coincidence that, in her grandmother's stories about
Earth, would have been called providence.

The planet would be nearest in fourteen months. After that, it would
continue on its lonely course, and the Farthest Shore would continue on
its own, and the two objects would never be near each other again.

Fourteen months. And then gone.

Astrid saved the data to her personal archive and locked the file. She
completed her shift. She walked the forty-seven steps back to her
quarters. She lay in her narrow bunk and stared at the ceiling and
thought about a world with no sun, drifting in the dark, and the faint,
inexplicable light upon its surface.

She did not sleep.

                               II.

The Council of the Farthest Shore met in the assembly hall on the second
deck, a broad, low-ceilinged room that served also as the ship's primary
gathering space. The council consisted of nine members: three elected
representatives, three appointed specialists, and three elders who
served by virtue of being among the oldest surviving passengers. The
eldest of these was Hakon Brandt, eighty-one years old, born aboard the
ship eleven months after launch. He had been born into the void, and he
would die in it, and this fact had given him, over the decades, a
quality of stern acceptance that the younger generations found both
admirable and somewhat frightening.

Astrid stood before them. She had prepared her presentation with care:
the gravitational data, the thermal signature, the telescopic images,
the spectral analysis of the luminescence. She laid it out cleanly,
without embellishment, letting the data speak.

The council listened. Hakon Brandt sat at the center of the long table,
his hands folded, his expression unreadable.

When she had finished, the silence lasted a long time.

"You are asking," said Councillor Miriam Voss, a geneticist who served
as the council's science representative, "whether we should alter course
to investigate this object."

"I am presenting the data," Astrid said. "The question of what to do
with it belongs to the council."

"But you have a recommendation."

Astrid hesitated. She had debated this with herself through three
sleepless nights. "Yes," she said. "I recommend investigation."

The room stirred. Astrid could feel the unease in it, a subtle shift in
the quality of the silence, like a change in air pressure.

"What would investigation require?" asked Hakon Brandt. His voice was
low and unhurried. He spoke the way the ship moved: steadily, without
urgency, as though time were an abundant resource.

Astrid had prepared for this. "A course correction of 4.2 degrees
would bring us within orbital distance of the planet. The maneuver
would require approximately sixteen months of deceleration and
repositioning, followed by a survey period of — at minimum — six months.
After that, we would need to re-establish our original trajectory and
accelerate back to cruise velocity."

"And the total time added to our voyage?"

Astrid drew a breath. "Thirty-one years."

The silence that followed was absolute.

Thirty-one years. Added to a voyage that was already projected to last
another sixty-one. Astrid would not live to see the arrival. None of the
elders would. The children being born this year — the fourth generation —
would be old when the Farthest Shore finally reached its destination.
Their children, the fifth generation, would be the ones to walk under an
alien sky.

"Thirty-one years," repeated Councillor Voss, as though testing the
weight of the words.

"For what?" said Councillor Erik Strand, the elected representative
from the agricultural sector. He was a practical man, broad-shouldered,
with the permanently sunburned look of someone who worked under the
grow-lights. "A frozen rock. A dead world. What do we gain?"

"Knowledge," Astrid said.

"We have knowledge. We have more knowledge than we know what to do
with. What we need is a destination. What we need is arrival."

"The luminescence —"

"Could be anything. Volcanic. Chemical. An instrument artifact. You
said yourself the signal is at the edge of your detection threshold."

"It does not match any known geological or chemical signature."

"Then it is an unknown geological or chemical signature. That does not
make it life."

Astrid said nothing. She had expected this. She had, in fact, rehearsed
this exact exchange in her quarters, playing both parts, and she had not
found a satisfactory answer then either.

"I would like to hear from Navigator Lund," said Hakon Brandt, "what
she believes the luminescence to be."

Astrid looked at the old man. His eyes were steady. He was not asking
for data. He was asking for something else.

"I do not know what it is," she said. "But I believe it is worth
finding out."

Brandt nodded slowly. "The council will deliberate," he said. "You will
be informed of our decision."

                               * * *

The deliberation lasted nine days. During those nine days, the news
spread through the ship — as news always did, despite the council's
preference for discretion — and the Farthest Shore divided itself, as it
always did, into factions.

There were those who supported investigation. They were, generally, the
younger passengers and the scientists — people for whom the voyage was
not merely a passage from one point to another but an ongoing act of
discovery. They argued that the Farthest Shore had been built to explore,
that its mission was not solely to arrive but to learn, and that to pass
within reach of such an extraordinary phenomenon and do nothing would be
a betrayal of everything the voyage represented.

There were those who opposed it. They were, generally, the older
passengers and the engineers — people who understood, in their bones, the
cost of deviation. Thirty-one years was not an abstraction to them. It
was food and water and air. It was wear on the engines. It was the
accumulated stress of an additional three decades on a ship that had
already been in flight for seventy-two years and was showing, in a
hundred small ways, the strain of its age. They argued that the ship's
resources were finite, that the margin of safety was narrower than most
passengers realized, and that the only responsible course was the one
they were already on: straight, steady, and as fast as the engines
would carry them.

And there were those — a smaller group, but a vocal one — who were
simply afraid. A rogue planet, drifting in the dark, emitting a light
that could not be explained. There was something unsettling about it.
Something that suggested the universe was stranger and less navigable
than the careful calculations of the navigation bay implied.

Astrid listened to all of it. She attended the informal gatherings in
the common areas where the arguments were aired. She heard the fear and
the hope and the pragmatic calculus of survival, and she recognized all
of it, because she felt all of it.

She also spent every available hour at the telescope.

The planet grew clearer as the ship drew nearer. It was enormous — a
gas-giant core stripped of its atmosphere, perhaps, or a super-Earth
formed in the outer reaches of a system and flung free by gravitational
perturbation. Its surface was dark and cratered. Ice fields covered the
poles, nitrogen ice, frozen solid in the absolute cold of interstellar
space.

And the luminescence was real. It was not an artifact. It was not
volcanic. It pulsed in patterns that were irregular but not random, and
it was concentrated along a network of fissures that crossed the
planet's equatorial region like the cracks in old porcelain.

Astrid mapped the fissures. She measured the periodicity of the light.
She compiled her findings into a supplementary report and submitted it
to the council without comment, because the data did not require
commentary. The light had a rhythm. The rhythm had structure. And
structure, in the vocabulary of the Farthest Shore, meant something.

It meant that someone — or something — was there.

                               III.

The council voted six to three in favor of investigation.

The announcement was made in the assembly hall, and the ship received
it with the complicated silence of a community that has made a decision
it is not entirely sure about. Hakon Brandt read the resolution in his
slow, careful voice. The Farthest Shore would alter course. The
investigation would proceed. The thirty-one years would be added to the
voyage.

Astrid stood at the back of the hall and felt something she did not
have a word for. It was not triumph. It was not relief. It was
something closer to vertigo — the sense of standing at the edge of a
great height and having chosen, deliberately, to step forward.

The deceleration began three days later. The ship's engines — massive
ion drives that had burned continuously for seventy-two years — adjusted
their thrust vector by 4.2 degrees, and the Farthest Shore began, with
glacial slowness, to turn.

You could not feel it. The change was too gradual, too subtle for human
senses to detect. But Astrid knew it was happening, because the star
field in the telescope shifted, degree by degree, and the rogue planet
moved from the edge of the forward display to the center.

They were going to meet it. After seventy-two years of straight-line
flight, the Farthest Shore was going to deviate. It was going to visit a
world that no one had expected to find, a world that should not have been
there, a world that pulsed with a light that had no explanation.

Astrid spent the sixteen months of approach in a state of sustained,
quiet intensity. She refined her measurements. She trained two junior
navigators in the techniques of planetary survey. She oversaw the
preparation of the ship's small complement of probes — four unmanned
vehicles, designed for atmospheric sampling and surface reconnaissance,
that had been stored in the cargo bay since launch and never used.

The planet grew. In the telescope, it expanded from a point of
occluded starlight to a disk, and from a disk to a world. Its surface
resolved into detail: craters and ridges, vast plains of frozen
nitrogen, mountain ranges thrust up by some ancient tectonic violence
and then stilled, forever, by the cold.

And the fissures. The equatorial fissures, glowing with their slow,
rhythmic light. As the ship drew closer, the resolution improved, and
Astrid could see that the light was not uniform. It varied in color — a
spectrum from deep amber to pale blue-white — and in intensity, and the
variations followed patterns that were complex and, she became
increasingly certain, purposeful.

She did not use the word "signal." She did not use the word
"communication." She recorded the data and let it accumulate, and she
waited.

                               * * *

They achieved orbit on a morning — ship's morning, an arbitrary
designation keyed to the circadian lighting schedule — in the fourth
month of the seventy-third year of the voyage. Astrid was in the
navigation bay when the orbital insertion was confirmed. She looked at
the main display, which showed the planet filling the lower half of the
screen, enormous and dark and silent, its fissures tracing lines of
light across the equator like the last embers of a fire that had burned
for a billion years.

Piet Janssen, standing beside her, said something that she would
remember for the rest of her life. He said it quietly, almost to
himself, in a tone of unguarded wonder that she had never heard from
him before.

"It is so alone," he said.

Yes, Astrid thought. Like us.

The probes were launched the following day. Four small vehicles,
dropping from the ship's belly toward the dark surface below. Astrid
monitored their descent from the navigation bay, tracking their
telemetry as they fell through the thin, frozen remnant of what might
once have been an atmosphere — traces of nitrogen and argon, too sparse
to be called air, too present to be called nothing.

Probe One landed on the northern ice field. Probe Two landed in a
crater basin near the equator. Probe Three landed on the edge of a
fissure. Probe Four malfunctioned during descent and was lost.

The data began to arrive.

The ice field was nitrogen ice over a substrate of silicate rock, as
expected. The crater basin was unremarkable. But Probe Three, perched on
the lip of the fissure, reported something that was not expected at all.

The fissure was warm. Not warm by human standards — the temperature
was minus one hundred and twelve degrees Celsius — but warm relative to
the surrounding surface, which was minus two hundred and thirty. A
temperature differential of over a hundred degrees, sustained by some
internal heat source that the probe's instruments could not identify.

And in the fissure, clinging to the walls of rock in thin, translucent
sheets, was something organic.

Not alive in any way that Astrid's training had prepared her to
recognize. Not cells, not tissues, not organisms. Something simpler and
stranger: a crystalline lattice of carbon-based molecules, organized in
repeating patterns of extraordinary complexity, that absorbed energy
from the planet's residual internal heat and emitted it as light. The
lattice grew. It spread. It branched and reconnected in patterns that
were — the ship's biologists confirmed, after three weeks of analysis —
not random.

They were not organisms. They were not machines. They were something
in between, or something outside either category entirely: a form of
organized matter that converted thermal energy into light with an
efficiency that bordered on the theoretical maximum, and that did so in
patterns that carried information.

The light was not random. The light was not decorative. The light was a
language.

And the lattice was speaking to itself.

                               IV.

Astrid spent the next four months learning to listen.

The biologists and the physicists and the linguists — the Farthest
Shore carried specialists in all these fields, because a generation ship
is a civilization in miniature, and a civilization requires every kind of
knowledge — worked together to decode the patterns. It was slow work.
The lattice's language was not symbolic in any way they recognized. It
was not a code. It was not a grammar. It was something more fundamental:
a set of relationships between light and structure, between the rhythm
of emission and the geometry of the lattice itself, that encoded
information in a way that was as different from human language as music
is from mathematics.

They could not translate it. They were not sure it could be translated.
But they could describe it, and what they described was a system of
extraordinary depth and beauty — a system that had been operating,
according to the best estimates of the ship's geologists, for
approximately three billion years.

Three billion years. The lattice had been growing in the fissures of
this sunless world, converting heat into light, speaking its luminous,
untranslatable language to itself, for longer than complex life had
existed on Earth.

Astrid stood in the navigation bay and stared at the images from Probe
Three. The fissure walls glowed with a light that shifted and pulsed and
branched and flickered in patterns that were, she now understood,
conversations. Dialogues conducted in photons across chasms of frozen
rock. A community of light, thriving in the dark, sustained by nothing
more than the slow cooling of a planet's core.

She thought of her grandmother. Sigrid Lund, who had stood in sunlight
and closed her eyes and seen the red of her own blood. Sigrid had tried,
many times, to describe the sun to Astrid, and she had always failed,
because the sun was not a thing that could be described. It was a thing
that could only be experienced. A warmth on the face. A brightness
behind the eyelids. A presence so vast and so fundamental that it
defined the world simply by being there.

Astrid had never had a sun. The people of the Farthest Shore had never
had a sun. They had traveled for seventy-three years through the
starless dark between systems, sustained by their engines and their
discipline and their quiet, unspoken agreement to endure.

And here, on this sunless world, in this frozen crack in the rock, was
something that had done the same. Something that had endured. Something
that had found, in the absence of everything that life was supposed to
require, a way to persist. A way to grow. A way to speak.

Astrid Lund had never seen a sun. But she had seen this.

                               * * *

The survey lasted six months, as planned. The ship's scientists
catalogued seventeen distinct lattice networks in the equatorial
fissures, each with its own characteristic patterns of luminescence. They
mapped the fissures in detail. They collected samples — carefully, with
enormous delicacy, aware that they were touching something that had been
undisturbed for three billion years. They argued, passionately and at
length, about what the lattice was and what it meant, and they did not
reach a consensus, because the lattice defied every framework they
brought to it.

It was alive, in some sense. It was organized, in some sense. It was
communicating, in some sense. But it was not alive in the way that any
Earth organism was alive, and it was not organized in the way that any
known system was organized, and it was not communicating in the way that
any language communicated. It was something new. Something that expanded
the definition of every word they tried to apply to it.

When the survey was complete, the council met again, and the question
was simple: What do we do now?

There were those who wanted to stay. The lattice was the most
significant discovery in the history of the voyage — in the history,
arguably, of the human species. To leave it after only six months of
study seemed not merely premature but irresponsible. A generation ship
could become a research station. The destination star could wait. This
was more important.

There were those who wanted to leave immediately. The thirty-one years
had already been added. Every additional day in orbit added more. The
ship's resources were not infinite. The destination was the destination.
They had come to find a new home, not to study a frozen rock.

Astrid listened. She sat in the back of the assembly hall, as she had
before, and she listened to the arguments, and she felt, again, that
sensation of standing at the edge of a great height.

When the debate had gone on for two days, Hakon Brandt raised his hand
for silence. The hall fell quiet.

"I would like to hear from Navigator Lund," he said.

Astrid stood. She walked to the front of the hall. She stood before the
council and the assembled passengers of the Farthest Shore, and she said
the thing she had been thinking for six months.

"We should leave," she said.

The hall stirred. She could feel the surprise — from those who had
expected her to argue for staying, who had assumed that the woman who had
found the planet would want to remain with it.

"We should leave," she said again, "because we have already received
what this place has to give us. The lattice has survived for three
billion years without a sun. It has grown and spoken and endured in
conditions that should have made existence impossible. It did not need us
to find it. It did not need us to understand it. It was here before us,
and it will be here after us, and its existence does not depend on our
observation.

"But our existence depends on our voyage. We are not a research
station. We are a ship. We have a destination, and people waiting to be
born who will need a world to live on. We owe them that world. We owe
them the arrival.

"What the lattice has given us is not data, though we have collected
data. It is not knowledge, though we have gained knowledge. What it has
given us is proof. Proof that life does not require a sun. Proof that
existence does not require comfort, or warmth, or light from above. Proof
that in the deepest dark, in the most absolute cold, something can
persist. Something can grow. Something can speak.

"We are that something. We have always been that something. We have
traveled for seventy-three years through the void, and we have persisted,
and we have grown, and we have spoken to each other in the dark. The
lattice is a mirror. It shows us what we already are.

"We should leave. We should continue. We should arrive."

The hall was silent for a long time.

Hakon Brandt, eighty-one years old, born in the void, destined to die
in it, looked at Astrid Lund with an expression she had never seen on
his face before. It might have been pride. It might have been sorrow. It
might have been both.

"The navigator's recommendation is noted," he said. "The council will
vote."

The vote was unanimous. The Farthest Shore would continue.

                               V.

The departure from orbit was gradual, as all things aboard the Farthest
Shore were gradual. The engines adjusted. The trajectory shifted. The
rogue planet began, degree by degree, to slide from the center of the
telescope's field of view toward the edge.

Astrid watched it go.

She stood in the navigation bay, alone — her shift had ended an hour
ago, but she had stayed — and she watched the planet diminish. The
fissures still glowed. The lattice still pulsed with its slow,
beautiful, untranslatable light. It would continue to pulse for another
three billion years, perhaps, or three billion more after that. It did
not know the ship had come. It did not know the ship was leaving. It
simply was, as the stars simply were, as the void simply was.

Piet Janssen found her there, three hours later, still watching.

"It's almost gone," he said.

"Yes."

"Will you miss it?"

Astrid considered the question. It deserved consideration.

"No," she said. "I will carry it."

The planet slipped below the threshold of the telescope's resolution
and became, once again, an absence — a patch of starless dark against
the slightly less dark background of interstellar space. Astrid watched
the place where it had been for a long time after it had vanished.

Then she turned off the display and walked the forty-seven steps to her
quarters. She lay in her narrow bunk. She closed her eyes.

Behind her eyelids, in the private dark, she saw light. Faint and
rhythmic and patient. A language she could not speak. A presence she
could not explain. A world that had found, in the absence of everything,
a way to shine.

Astrid Lund had never seen a sun. But she had seen something, she
thought, that was perhaps more important. She had seen the proof that
the dark was not empty.

She slept, and the ship moved on, and the void ahead was vast and
cold and full of things that had not yet been found.

                         EVERY MOUTH A RICTUS

                          by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

I have set down this account because I was asked to, and because the
alternative — silence — has become its own kind of affliction. The
doctors at the station on Callisto, where I am presently convalescing,
have encouraged me to write. They believe it will be therapeutic. I do
not share their optimism, but I have found that the act of writing
provides, at least, a structure for the hours, which have grown long and
shapeless since my return, and which are haunted by a particular quality
of stillness that I cannot seem to dislodge.

I should say at the outset that I am not entirely certain of the
accuracy of what follows. Memory, under the conditions I experienced,
becomes unreliable — not in the way of simple forgetting, but in a more
insidious fashion, as though the events themselves have shifted in the
retelling, rearranging their sequence and emphasis to suit some narrative
purpose that is not my own. I have done my best to be truthful. I
cannot guarantee that I have been accurate.

My name is Dr. Elliot Crane. I am — I was — the chief medical officer
of Rescue and Recovery Unit Seven, attached to the Colonial
Administration's Emergency Response Division. Our unit operated in the
outer system: Jupiter's moons, the Saturn colonies, the scattered
research stations and mining outposts that cling to the edges of
civilized space like barnacles on a rotting hull. We were, in the
parlance of the service, "the last call" — the team that went in when
communications failed, when ships went silent, when the regular channels
of assistance had been exhausted and something more desperate was
required.

I had served in the unit for eleven years. I had seen things that I will
not describe here, because they are not relevant to this account and
because some experiences do not benefit from additional exposure to
daylight. I mention my tenure only to establish that I was not, by the
time of the Hesperus incident, a man easily unsettled.

I was wrong about that. I was wrong about a great many things.

                               * * *

The distress signal from the Hesperus Colony arrived at our station on
the fourteenth of March, and it arrived wrong.

I do not mean that it was garbled or incomplete. I mean that its
character was wrong — its tone, its cadence, the quality of the silence
between its automated pulses. A standard colonial distress beacon
transmits a repeating signal at a fixed interval: three seconds of tone,
five seconds of silence, three seconds of tone. It is monotonous and
urgent and unmistakable. The Hesperus signal followed this pattern
exactly, and yet there was something in it — a quality I could not name
then and cannot name now — that made the hair rise on the back of my
neck when I first heard it played through the station's speakers.

Commander Vasquez, who led our unit, noticed nothing unusual. Neither
did Kessler, our pilot, or Park, our systems specialist, or Okonkwo,
our structural engineer. I asked them, later, whether the signal had
struck them as odd, and they looked at me with the patient blankness
of people who have been asked a question they do not understand. It was
a distress signal. It sounded like a distress signal. What more was
there to say?

I said nothing more. But I noted it, and I noted it again when we
received the supplementary data packet from Colonial Administration: the
Hesperus Colony, a research station on Enceladus, population forty-one,
had ceased all communication eighteen days prior. No distress call
before the automated beacon activated. No logs, no reports, no personal
messages. Simply silence, sudden and complete, as though the colony had
been switched off.

We departed within the hour. The transit from our station to Enceladus
took four days, and during those four days I reviewed everything the
Administration had on file about the Hesperus Colony. It was a
xenobiology station, established three years prior to study the
subsurface ocean that was believed to exist beneath the moon's icy crust.
The personnel were scientists, mostly — biologists, chemists, geologists
— along with a small support staff of engineers and technicians. The
station commander was a woman named Dr. Isolde Ferren, a xenobiologist
of considerable reputation whose published work I had read and admired.

Nothing in the file suggested a reason for the silence. The station's
systems were functioning normally, according to the last telemetry
received before communications ceased. Power, life support, atmospheric
integrity — all within nominal parameters. Forty-one people, healthy and
operational, and then nothing.

I have since learned to recognize that particular pattern — normalcy
followed by silence — as the most dangerous pattern there is. A system
failure announces itself. An accident leaves evidence. A disease
progresses. But when everything is normal and then everything is quiet,
it means that whatever happened was not a failure, not an accident, not
a disease. It means that whatever happened was something that the
colonists did not recognize as a threat until it was too late to report
it. Or — and this is the possibility that I did not allow myself to
consider at the time — it means that whatever happened was something
they did not wish to report.

                               * * *

Enceladus, seen from orbit, is a world of ice. It is small — barely
five hundred kilometers in diameter — and it is white, almost uniformly
white, its surface scarred by long, parallel fractures that the
geologists call "tiger stripes," from which plumes of water vapor and
ice particles erupt periodically into the vacuum. It is, by any
objective standard, a beautiful world. I did not find it beautiful. I
found it, on that approach, oppressively blank — a world that offered
the eye nothing to hold onto, no landmark, no variation, nothing but
the white and the cracks in the white and the black sky above.

The Hesperus Colony was located near the south pole, adjacent to the
largest of the tiger stripe fractures. From orbit, it was a small
cluster of pressurized modules — domes and cylinders connected by
enclosed walkways — that looked, against the ice, like a scattering of
pills on a bedsheet.

Kessler brought us down on the station's landing pad. The descent was
routine. The touchdown was smooth. Through the cockpit windows, I could
see the nearest module — the station's main habitat — and its lights
were on. The windows glowed warmly against the white of the ice and the
black of the sky. It looked, from the outside, like a place where people
lived. It looked normal.

"Atmosphere reads clean," Park reported from her console. "Standard
colonial mix. Pressure nominal. No contaminants detected."

"Life signs?" Vasquez asked.

Park was quiet for a moment. Then: "Forty-one. All present. All within
normal biological parameters."

I remember the way Vasquez looked at me when she heard that. Forty-one
people, all alive, all healthy, and yet eighteen days of silence. Her
expression was not relief. Her expression was the expression of someone
who has opened a door they expected to find locked and found it standing
open, and who is now wondering what opened it, and why.

"Gear up," she said. "Standard approach. Crane, you're with me on
point."

We suited up and entered through the station's main airlock. The outer
door opened at our approach — the automatic sensors were functioning —
and we stepped into the decontamination chamber, and the inner door
cycled, and we walked into the Hesperus Colony.

The corridor beyond the airlock was well-lit and clean. The air was
warm. There was a faint smell — not unpleasant, but unusual. Sweet.
Organic. Like overripe fruit, or flowers left too long in a vase.

And there was sound. Or rather, there was an absence of the sounds I
had expected — the hum of ventilation, the distant clatter of equipment,
the murmur of conversation that characterizes any inhabited station —
replaced by a quality of silence that was not quite silence. It was the
sound of people being very, very still.

We moved through the corridor. The lights were on. The doors were open.
Everything was clean, maintained, operational. And empty. Room after room
after room, all empty, all lit, all warm, all permeated by that faint,
sweet smell.

We found them in the mess hall.

All forty-one of them. Seated at the long tables, arranged in orderly
rows, their hands resting on the table surfaces or folded in their laps.
They were dressed in their normal work clothes. They were clean. They
were upright. They were breathing.

And they were smiling.

Every one of them. Every face turned toward us as we entered — a slow,
synchronized movement, like sunflowers tracking the light — and every
face bore the same expression: a wide, fixed, radiant smile. Lips drawn
back. Teeth visible. Eyes open and bright and focused and utterly,
appallingly empty.

I have seen many things in my years with Rescue and Recovery. I have
seen the dead and the dying. I have seen the aftermath of decompression
and fire and structural collapse. I have seen fear, and grief, and the
peculiar calmness that descends upon people who have accepted that they
are going to die. None of it prepared me for this. None of it approached
the visceral, bone-deep wrongness of forty-one people sitting in perfect
silence, smiling at nothing, smiling at everything, smiling with an
intensity that distorted their features and stretched the muscles of
their faces into configurations that were not, I realized with a slow
crawl of nausea, entirely voluntary.

They could not stop.

"Dr. Ferren?" Vasquez said. Her voice was steady. I admired her for
that. "Dr. Isolde Ferren? I am Commander Vasquez, Rescue and Recovery
Unit Seven. We received your distress signal. Can you tell me what
happened here?"

The woman at the head of the nearest table — I recognized her from her
file photograph: Dr. Ferren, the station commander — turned her smiling
face toward Vasquez and spoke.

"We are very well," she said. Her voice was pleasant. Conversational.
The smile did not waver. "We are very well and very happy. Thank you
for coming. You did not need to come. We are very well."

"Your communications went silent eighteen days ago. Can you explain
that?"

"We did not feel the need to communicate. We are very well. We are
very happy."

"Dr. Ferren, I need to understand what has happened here. Are you
under duress?"

The smile widened, though I would not have thought it possible. "No,"
said Dr. Ferren. "We are not under duress. We are very happy. Won't
you sit down? Won't you stay with us? It is so lovely here."

Vasquez looked at me. I could see, behind her visor, the effort it was
taking her to maintain her composure. I suspect my own face was not
reassuring.

"Crane," she said. "Medical assessment."

I stepped forward. I approached Dr. Ferren with my scanner raised,
and she watched me come with that terrible, luminous smile, and when I
was close enough to see the fine details of her face — the stretched
skin, the tension in the muscles around her mouth, the faint tremor in
her lower lip that suggested the smile was being maintained against some
enormous, unrelenting internal pressure — I understood something that I
had been trying not to understand since we walked into the room.

They were not smiling because they were happy.

They were smiling because something was making them smile.

I ran the scanner over Dr. Ferren's face and neck and torso, and the
readings were wrong. Her neurochemistry was wrong. Her serotonin levels
were catastrophically elevated — far beyond anything that could be
produced by normal biological processes. Her dopamine was similarly
distorted. The pleasure centers of her brain were firing continuously,
at an intensity that should have been physiologically impossible, and the
motor neurons controlling her facial muscles were locked in a pattern
of sustained activation that the scanner flagged, with clinical
precision, as involuntary.

She was smiling because her brain was being flooded with a chemical
signal that forced her to smile. She was happy because something was
making her happy. And the distinction between genuine happiness and
compelled happiness — a distinction that, in normal circumstances, is
absolute and inviolable — had been erased.

"What did this?" I asked her, and I heard the tremor in my own voice,
and I could not suppress it. "Dr. Ferren. What did this to you?"

The smile. The terrible, unrelenting smile. "Nothing did this to us,
Doctor. We are simply happy. Is that not permitted? Is that not what
everyone seeks?"

"This is not natural. Your neurochemistry has been altered. Something
has —"

"We found something," she said. Her voice was soft, confiding,
intimate. "In the ocean. Below the ice. We brought a sample to the
surface and it was so beautiful, Doctor. So beautiful. And when we
looked at it — when we truly looked at it — it looked back. And it
shared with us what it had. It shared its joy."

I stepped back. I turned to Vasquez. I said, very carefully, "Commander,
we need to leave. Now. Without further contact."

But Vasquez was not looking at me. Vasquez was looking at the far end
of the mess hall, where Okonkwo — our structural engineer, who had
entered the room behind us and who I had not been monitoring because I
had been focused on Dr. Ferren — was standing very still.

He was standing very still, and he was looking at the smiling colonists,
and he was smiling.

Not the fixed, forced, terrible smile of the colonists. Not yet. A
small smile. A gentle smile. The beginning of a smile. But it was
spreading, visibly, like a crack in glass, widening across his face with
a speed and an inevitability that made my stomach clench.

"Okonkwo," I said. "Okonkwo, close your eyes. Do not look at them.
Close your eyes now."

He did not close his eyes. He could not close his eyes. He was looking
at the colonists, and the colonists were looking at him, and something
was passing between them — through the medium of eye contact, through
the channel of mutual observation — that was rewriting the chemistry of
his brain in real time.

I grabbed his arm. I pulled him backward, out of the mess hall, into
the corridor. Vasquez was shouting orders. Park and Kessler, who had
remained in the ship, were responding over the radio. Okonkwo was
stumbling beside me, his legs uncoordinated, his face still wearing
that spreading, helpless smile.

"It's all right," he said, and his voice had already acquired the
pleasant, conversational quality of Dr. Ferren's. "It's all right,
Crane. I feel wonderful. I feel so wonderful. Why are you frightened?
There's nothing to be frightened of."

I sealed my visor. I should have done it earlier. I should have done it
the moment we entered the room. But one does not expect a smile to be
contagious. One does not expect happiness to be a weapon.

We retreated to the ship. I placed Okonkwo in the medical bay and
sedated him — heavily, perhaps more heavily than was strictly necessary,
but I wanted the smile off his face and the sedation was the only tool
I had. Under sedation, his facial muscles relaxed, and the smile faded,
and he looked, for a moment, like the man I had known for six years: a
quiet, competent engineer from Lagos who played chess badly and kept a
photograph of his daughter taped to his workstation.

Then the sedation began to wear off, and the smile came back. Slowly.
Inexorably. Rising through the chemical suppression like something
surfacing from deep water.

                               * * *

I will be brief about what followed, because the details are in the
official report, and because I find that the act of recalling them in
sequence produces, in me, a physical response — a tightness in the
chest, a shortness of breath, an overwhelming urge to look away — that
I have been told is consistent with acute psychological trauma.

We could not help the colonists. We could not cure Okonkwo. The
organism — for I will call it an organism, though the xenobiologists at
Callisto have suggested that it may be something more fundamental, a
chemical process rather than a living thing, a reaction rather than an
entity — had integrated itself into the neurochemistry of its hosts so
thoroughly that removing it would have required, in effect, dismantling
their brains.

It spread through eye contact. That was the vector. Not airborne, not
tactile, not ingested. Visual. Something in the configuration of the
smile — some pattern of muscular activation, some arrangement of
features — triggered a response in the observer's brain that initiated
the process of neurochemical restructuring. The process was rapid — in
Okonkwo's case, perhaps ninety seconds from initial exposure to full
onset — and it was, as far as we could determine, irreversible.

The colonists had discovered the organism in the subsurface ocean. It
existed there as a diffuse chemical presence — a soup of complex organic
molecules that responded to light, to warmth, to the electrical activity
of living brains. When the colonists brought a sample to the surface and
examined it in their laboratory, it had responded to their observation
by triggering the neurochemical cascade that produced the smile. The
first researcher to be affected had turned to her colleagues to report
her findings, and they had looked at her face, and the smile had spread.

Forty-one people, in less than a day. And then silence, because the
organism did not want to communicate with the outside world. It wanted
to be looked at. It wanted to be seen. It wanted eyes.

We left. We sealed the colony. We filed our report. Okonkwo was
transferred to the isolation facility on Callisto, where he remains,
where he sits in a white room and smiles at the wall and tells anyone
who enters that he is very well, that he is very happy, that there is
nothing to be frightened of.

I have not visited him. I have been told that his daughter has visited
him, once, and that she wept, and that he smiled at her tears and told
her that everything was beautiful.

I am told that the colonial administration is debating what to do about
the Hesperus Colony. There are those who advocate quarantine. There are
those who advocate destruction. There are those — and this is the
possibility that keeps me awake at night, staring at the ceiling of my
room on Callisto, listening to the hum of the ventilation system and
the silence beyond it — who advocate further study.

They want to send another team. They want to understand the organism.
They want to know how it works, and whether it can be controlled, and
whether its effects can be harnessed for therapeutic purposes.

They want to look at it.

I have told them what happens when you look. I have told them about the
smile. I have told them about Okonkwo, and Dr. Ferren, and the forty-one
people sitting in the white light of the mess hall, smiling at nothing,
smiling at everything, smiling forever.

They listened to me, and they nodded, and they said they understood.

And then they smiled, politely, and told me not to worry.

I am writing this in my room. It is late. The lights of the Callisto
station are dimmed to simulate night, and the corridors outside my door
are quiet. I have not looked at anyone's face in several days. I
communicate through written messages. I take my meals alone. The doctors
say this is a symptom of my trauma, and they are probably right.

But I have noticed — and I record this here not as evidence but as
observation, to be evaluated by whoever reads this account — that the
doctors smile more than they used to. It is a small thing. A subtle
thing. The kind of thing that a man in my condition might be expected to
imagine.

But I have noticed it. And I am not sure, anymore, whether it is safe
to look.

                        CHROMIUM THUNDER

                        by Rex Drummond

================================================================================

Vince Delacroix was elbow-deep in the guts of a Ransom & Caldwell
Mark IV rocket sled when the trouble walked in.

He heard it before he saw it — the clack-clack-clack of expensive boots
on the ferrocrete floor of his garage, a sound that didn't belong among
the oil stains and welding sparks and the sweet reek of hypergolic fuel
that was Vince's natural habitat. He slid out from under the sled on
his crawler, squinting up through a faceful of grease, and saw a pair
of legs in pressed khaki trousers, a belt buckle the size of a dinner
plate, and above it all the broad, sun-darkened, smiling face of
Alejandro "El Cuchillo" Reyes.

"Vinnie!" Reyes spread his arms wide like a long-lost uncle. Gold teeth
gleamed. "My friend! My very good friend!"

Vince wiped his hands on a rag that was dirtier than his hands. "I ain't
your friend, Reyes. Last time you were my friend, I ended up in a
Martian jail for two weeks."

"A misunderstanding! Ancient history!" Reyes waved it off like a fly.
"I come to you with an opportunity, Vinnie. A once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity."

"That's what you said about the Phobos run."

"This is bigger than Phobos. This is Olympus."

Vince sat up on the crawler. In spite of himself — in spite of every
hard-earned instinct that told him to throw Reyes out of his garage and
bolt the door — he felt the old kick in his chest. The kick that had
gotten him into racing in the first place, fifteen years ago, when he
was a skinny kid from the Tharsis slums with fast hands and no sense.

"The Olympus Mons downhill," he said.

"The Olympus Mons downhill!" Reyes confirmed, grinning like a cat in a
fish market. "One hundred miles, top to bottom. Volcanic canyons.
Switchbacks. Straightaways where a good sled hits Mach 2. Prize purse:
fifty thousand credits. And this year — this year, Vinnie — I am the
organizer."

Vince stared at him. "You. You're running the downhill."

"I have acquired the franchise. Legitimate! Papers signed, fees paid,
everything above-board. Well." He wobbled one hand. "Mostly above-board.
The point is, I need drivers. Good drivers. The best drivers. And you,
Vinnie — you are the best there is."

"Was," Vince said. "I've been out of the circuit three years."

"And every day of those three years, people still talk about the Valles
Marineris run. The way you took that hairpin at the Coprates turn —
sideways, on one ski, at six hundred miles an hour — they still talk
about it!"

"I nearly died."

"Nearly! That is the word that separates legends from corpses!" Reyes
leaned closer. His cologne was aggressive. "Fifty thousand credits,
Vinnie. Split sixty-forty — sixty to you, of course."

"Of course," Vince said dryly.

"All you need is a sled."

Vince looked over his shoulder at the Mark IV. She was a battered old
warhorse — fifteen years of hard racing had left her hull scarred and
her frame stressed — but under the dents and the scorchmarks, she was
still the fastest sled on Mars. Vince had rebuilt her engine twice,
upgraded her thrust nozzles, tuned her magnetic skis to a tolerance of
point-zero-zero-one percent. She could do Mach 2 on a good day. On a
great day, with the right slope and a tail wind, she could touch Mach 3.

"I got a sled," he said.

Reyes' gold teeth flashed. "Then we have a deal?"

Vince knew he shouldn't. He knew it the way you know not to touch a hot
stove — the knowledge was in his bones, in the scar tissue on his arms,
in the metal pin that held his left collarbone together after the crash
at Acidalia Planitia. But the kick was there. The kick was always there.
The kick was the thing that made him Vince Delacroix instead of just
another grease monkey in the Tharsis slums.

"We got a deal," he said.

                               * * *

The Olympus Mons downhill was not, technically speaking, legal.

The Martian Colonial Authority had banned unsanctioned racing on public
terrain six years ago, after a spectacular wreck in the Noctis Labyrinthus
killed two drivers and a spectator. The ban had driven the sport
underground, which meant it was now more dangerous, more expensive, and
more popular than ever. Races were organized in secret, courses mapped
by scouts who bribed the MCA patrol schedules out of corrupt officials,
and the drivers — the ones crazy enough or desperate enough or addicted
enough to the speed — gathered at hidden staging areas in the predawn
hours and hurled themselves down mountainsides at velocities that would
have given a test pilot nightmares.

Vince had driven in a dozen underground races before he retired. He'd
won eight of them. He'd crashed in two. He'd walked away from both
crashes, which put him ahead of the statistical curve by a comfortable
margin. The Olympus Mons downhill, though — that was something else.
That was the big one. The Everest of sled racing. A hundred miles of
volcanic terrain, starting at the caldera rim, twenty-two kilometers
above the datum — the Martian equivalent of sea level — and ending on
the plains of Amazonis Planitia. The grade averaged six percent, but
there were stretches where it hit fifteen, twenty, and one infamous
section called the Devil's Chute that dropped nearly vertical for half
a mile before flattening out into a canyon run that demanded instant
deceleration from supersonic to subsonic speeds, a maneuver that had
killed more drivers than any other obstacle on Mars.

Vince spent three weeks preparing. He stripped the Mark IV down to her
frame, rebuilt the engine with new injectors and a modified combustion
chamber that gave him an extra twelve percent thrust, reinforced the
hull with a carbon-titanium laminate that would hold together — he
hoped — at Mach 3, and recalibrated the magnetic skis for volcanic
basalt, which was rougher and more unpredictable than the sandstone he
was used to racing on.

He also did his homework on the other drivers. There were sixteen
entrants — Reyes had sent him the list — and Vince knew most of them
by reputation if not in person. There was Kira Tanaka, the Japanese
pilot who'd won the Elysium sprint three years running. There was
"Big" Jack Halloran, a former MCA patrol officer who'd gone rogue and
brought his military-spec sled with him. There was Pavel Andreyev, the
Russian, who drove with a precision that was almost mechanical and
who had never, in twelve years of racing, lost his composure or his
line.

And there was someone called Nighthawk.

No real name. No biography. No racing record that Vince could find.
Just a name on the entry list and a rumor that circulated through the
Tharsis racing underground like smoke through a ventilation shaft:
Nighthawk was fast. Nighthawk was dangerous. Nighthawk drove a custom
sled that nobody had seen and that nobody could identify.

Vince didn't like mysteries. In racing, a mystery was a variable, and
variables killed people.

He called Reyes. "Who's Nighthawk?"

"A driver! A very good driver!"

"I know that. Who is it?"

"Vinnie, Vinnie. You know I can't reveal the identities of my
participants. Confidentiality! It's in the contract!"

"Since when do you have contracts?"

"Since I became a legitimate businessman! Listen, Vinnie, don't worry
about Nighthawk. Worry about the course. Worry about the Devil's Chute.
Worry about your own sled. Nighthawk is just another driver."

Vince hung up and worried about Nighthawk.

                               * * *

Race day came on a Tuesday, because nothing important on Mars ever
happened on a day that felt important.

The staging area was at the rim of the caldera, twenty-two kilometers
up, where the air was so thin it was barely there and the sky was black
even at noon. Sixteen sleds lined up on a strip of flattened basalt,
their engines ticking and hissing in the cold, their hulls catching the
low Martian sun and throwing it back in flashes of chrome and steel and
painted flame.

Vince's Mark IV was the oldest sled on the line. She looked it, too —
scarred and patched and welded, a prizefighter past her prime. But her
engine was singing a low, sweet note that Vince knew like his own
heartbeat, and when he settled into the cockpit and strapped in, the
sled fit him like a glove.

He scanned the line. Tanaka was three slots to his left, her sled a
sleek silver needle. Halloran was two to his right, his military rig
bristling with stabilizers. Andreyev was at the far end, calm as a
coffin.

And in slot fourteen — Nighthawk.

The sled was black. Not painted black — black, as though it absorbed
light rather than reflecting it. It was smaller than the others, low
and narrow, with a profile that suggested speed the way a shark's
silhouette suggests violence. No markings. No insignia. No exhaust
ports that Vince could see, which meant either a very unusual engine
configuration or a drive system he didn't recognize.

The cockpit canopy was tinted. He couldn't see the driver.

"All right, folks!" Reyes' voice crackled over the radio, buoyant and
theatrical. "Welcome to the fifth annual Olympus Mons downhill! One
hundred miles of the finest volcanic real estate on Mars! Standard
rules: no weapons, no ramming, no deliberate interference with another
vehicle. Apart from that — drive fast, drive mean, and try not to die!"

The starting gun fired — literally fired, because Reyes had a flair for
the dramatic — and sixteen rocket sleds leaped forward with a combined
roar that shook the caldera rim and sent a plume of dust a hundred feet
into the thin Martian air.

Vince was third off the line. Tanaka was first — she always was, her
reflexes were inhuman — and Halloran was second, his military sled's
raw thrust punching him ahead like a fist. Vince didn't fight for
position. Not yet. The first ten miles were a gradual descent through
the caldera's outer slopes, relatively smooth, relatively safe, and the
race wouldn't really begin until they hit the canyon section at mile
eleven.

He settled into his rhythm. The sled hummed beneath him, responsive and
eager, and the Martian landscape unrolled ahead in a vast sweep of
rust-red rock and black basalt, the horizon impossibly distant, the sky
impossibly dark. At this speed — six hundred miles an hour, barely above
cruising — the world was a blur of color and motion, and Vince felt the
old joy kindle in his chest, the joy that was the flip side of the fear,
the joy that said you are alive, you are fast, you are free.

Mile five. Mile seven. Mile nine. The pack began to stretch out. The
faster sleds pulled ahead; the slower ones fell back. Vince held his
position in the middle, conserving his engine, reading the terrain,
waiting.

At mile eleven, the canyons began.

The slope steepened. The smooth basalt gave way to broken, jagged
volcanic rock. Walls of black stone rose on either side, funneling the
sleds into a corridor that narrowed and twisted and dropped with a
suddenness that turned Vince's stomach and lit up every warning on his
instrument panel.

He gunned it.

The Mark IV surged forward with a scream of thrust that pressed Vince
back into his seat and blurred his vision. The canyon walls whipped past.
The sled's magnetic skis sang against the rock. Vince took the first
switchback at eight hundred miles an hour, leaning into the turn with
his whole body, feeling the sled's frame flex and groan, and came out
the other side two positions ahead and accelerating.

Mach 1. Mach 1.2. Mach 1.5. The sonic boom bounced off the canyon
walls and came back as a rolling, physical thunder that shook the sled
and rattled Vince's teeth. He passed Halloran on a straight section,
the military sled's bulk working against it in the tight canyon, and
slotted in behind Tanaka, who was driving the line like a surgeon with
a scalpel — precise, economical, beautiful.

And then, in his rearview display, he saw Nighthawk.

The black sled was coming up through the pack like a missile. No — not
like a missile. Missiles were loud and bright and obvious. Nighthawk was
silent. The black sled moved through the canyon without sound, without
visible exhaust, without any of the turbulence and fury that
characterized a rocket sled at full burn. It simply moved — quickly,
smoothly, inevitably — and the sleds in its path moved aside or were
passed so cleanly that their drivers didn't realize it had happened
until the black shape was already ahead.

Vince watched it with a cold knot forming in his gut. That was not a
rocket engine. That was not any kind of engine he recognized. That sled
was moving in a way that defied the physics of sled racing, and it was
doing it silently, which meant it was doing it effortlessly, which
meant —

"Reyes," Vince said into the radio. "What the hell is Nighthawk
driving?"

"Focus on your own race, Vinnie!"

"That sled isn't running a rocket engine. It's running something else.
Something I've never seen."

"Maybe you haven't seen everything, eh? Drive your race!"

Vince drove his race. He took the canyon section at speeds that would
have made his younger self whistle, threading through the switchbacks
with a combination of skill and recklessness that left his hands
shaking and his heart hammering. He passed Tanaka at mile twenty-two,
catching her on the inside of a hairpin turn that she took wide, and he
held the lead for three beautiful, terrifying miles.

Then Nighthawk passed him.

The black sled appeared on his left, low and silent, and for a fraction
of a second — a fraction that burned itself into Vince's memory with
the permanence of a brand — he looked through the tinted canopy and saw
the driver.

He couldn't see much. A face, obscured by a helmet visor. A pair of
hands on the controls. But the hands were wrong. They were too long.
The fingers had too many joints. And they moved with a fluidity that
was not human, that was mechanical, that was —

Nighthawk pulled ahead and was gone.

                               * * *

The Devil's Chute was at mile fifty-eight. Vince hit it at Mach 2.1,
which was too fast — everybody hit the Chute too fast, because the
approach was a long, seductive straightaway that invited you to open the
throttle, and by the time you saw the drop it was too late to slow
down — and he felt the sled go vertical beneath him, the Gs slamming
him down into his seat, the magnetic skis screaming against the rock
face as the Mark IV plummeted half a mile in eight seconds.

The canyon at the bottom came up fast. Too fast. Vince hauled on the
retro-rockets and felt the sled shudder and buck as it decelerated from
supersonic to subsonic in a maneuver that compressed his spine and
grayed out his vision. He made it. Barely. The Mark IV's port ski
clipped the canyon wall and sent a shower of sparks across his canopy,
but he held the line, and he was through.

Behind him, he heard the sound he'd been dreading: the flat, concussive
bang of a sled hitting rock at speed. He didn't look back. You never
looked back in the Chute. Looking back was how you joined the wreckage.

He was in second place now, behind Nighthawk. Tanaka was third, ten
seconds back. Andreyev was fourth. Of the original sixteen, he counted
eleven still on the course.

At mile sixty-five, his radio crackled. "Vinnie." It was a new voice.
Not Reyes. A woman's voice, low and urgent. "Vinnie, can you hear me?"

"Who is this?"

"Tanaka. Listen to me. Something's wrong with the course."

"I noticed. There's a sled out there that doesn't run on —"

"Not that. The course itself. The markers for the final canyon section —
they're wrong. They're leading us into a dead end. There's a box canyon
at mile eighty that isn't on the maps. If we follow the markers, we
drive straight into a wall."

Vince felt the cold knot in his gut tighten. "How do you know?"

"Because I've scouted this mountain six times and I know every canyon
on it. The markers have been moved. Someone rigged the course."

Vince thought about Reyes. About his gold teeth and his cologne and his
assurances that everything was legitimate. About the way he'd dodged
the question about Nighthawk. About the fifty-thousand-credit purse and
the sixteen drivers and the box canyon at mile eighty.

"Reyes," he said. "He rigged it."

"That's my guess. He's got a sled in this race — Nighthawk. Whatever
that thing is, it's not a standard racer. And if the rest of us pile
into a box canyon at Mach 2 —"

"Nighthawk wins by default. And Reyes keeps the purse."

"And we're dead."

Vince's jaw tightened. His hands tightened on the controls. The Mark IV
was shaking — she'd been pushed hard, harder than she'd been pushed in
years, and the port ski was damaged from the clip in the Chute — but she
was still running, still fast, still game.

"Can we get word to the others?"

"I've been broadcasting on the open channel. Andreyev heard me. Halloran
heard me. The rest — I don't know."

"All right. New plan. I'm going to catch Nighthawk."

"Catch Nighthawk? Vinnie, that sled is running on something we can't —"

"I don't need to be faster. I need to be smarter. There's a fork at
mile seventy-three — left goes into the standard canyon run, right drops
down through the secondary vents. The vents are tight, but they bypass
the box canyon and come out on the plains below mile eighty-five. If I
take the vents and Nighthawk follows the rigged markers —"

"The vents are suicide, Vinnie. Nobody's ever run the vents."

"Correction: nobody's ever run the vents and lived to brag about it.
But nobody's ever run 'em in a Mark IV with custom skis and a rebuilt
engine and fifteen years of experience in canyons a lot meaner than
these."

There was a pause. Then Tanaka said, "You're insane."

"Lady, I'm a sled racer. It's the same thing."

He killed the radio and pushed the throttle forward.

                               * * *

Mile seventy-three. The fork.

The markers — Reyes' markers, the rigged markers — pointed left, into
the main canyon. Vince could see, a quarter-mile ahead, the black shape
of Nighthawk taking the left fork at impossible speed, following the
false course toward the box canyon that wasn't on the maps.

Vince went right.

The secondary vents were exactly as bad as advertised. They were
volcanic tubes — tunnels of ancient lava, collapsed in places, narrowed
in others, twisted and kinked and pitch-dark except for the harsh white
glare of Vince's headlamps. The Mark IV screamed through them at eight
hundred miles an hour, her magnetic skis inches from the walls, her hull
scraping the ceiling in places, the sound of her passage amplified by
the enclosed space into a roar so loud it drowned out thought.

Vince didn't think. He drove. He drove on instinct, on muscle memory,
on the accumulated wisdom of fifteen years of running canyons and
tunnels and chutes and drops. The vents twisted; he twisted with them.
The vents narrowed; he tilted the sled on edge and threaded the gap.
The vents dropped; he cut the engine and let the sled fall, then fired
the retros and pulled up with two feet of clearance and a prayer on his
lips that he would have denied, later, ever uttering.

It lasted four minutes. Four minutes that felt like four hours. Four
minutes of absolute focus, absolute commitment, absolute refusal to die
in a hole in the ground on a planet that wasn't even his home.

And then the vents opened, and the Martian sky blazed above him, and
the plains of Amazonis Planitia stretched ahead to the horizon, flat and
red and beautiful.

He was ahead.

He was ahead of Nighthawk. He was ahead of everyone. The rigged course
was behind him, and the finish line — a strip of painted ferrocrete on
the plains below the mountain — was fifteen miles away.

Vince laughed. He couldn't help it. He threw his head back and laughed
and pushed the throttle to the wall, and the Mark IV leaped forward
with a scream of triumph that echoed off the mountain behind him.

Mach 2. Mach 2.5. Mach 2.8.

In his rearview display, he saw Nighthawk emerge from the mountain.
The black sled had figured it out — had found the box canyon, had
realized the course was rigged, had doubled back and found a way through.
It was fast. It was impossibly fast. It was gaining.

Five miles to the finish. Nighthawk was closing.

Three miles. Nighthawk was close enough to see the details — the black
hull, the absence of exhaust, the alien smoothness of its approach.

Two miles. Vince could feel the air pressure building behind him as
Nighthawk's wake effect disrupted his aerodynamics. The Mark IV bucked
and shuddered.

One mile. Nighthawk was alongside him. Through the tinted canopy, those
too-long fingers moved on the controls with inhuman precision.

Vince looked at the finish line. He looked at Nighthawk. He looked at
his instrument panel, where every gauge was redlined and every warning
light was screaming.

He hit the afterburner.

The Mark IV had an afterburner because Vince had installed one, illegally,
three years ago, using a salvaged military injector and a prayer. He had
never used it in a race. He had never used it at all, because using it
meant dumping raw fuel into the combustion chamber at a rate that would
either produce a burst of speed or produce an explosion, and the
probability of each outcome was, as far as Vince could calculate,
roughly equal.

The Mark IV screamed. Not the mechanical scream of an engine at full
thrust — a different sound, higher, wilder, the sound of a machine
exceeding its design parameters by a margin that its builders would have
called impossible. The sled leaped forward. Mach 3. Mach 3.2. The
instrument panel went dark — every system overloaded, every circuit
blown — and Vince was flying blind, flying on pure speed, the finish
line rushing toward him like a wall.

He crossed it at Mach 3.4, a hundred feet ahead of Nighthawk, and the
sonic boom that followed him across the line shattered every piece of
glass in the judges' booth and knocked Reyes flat on his back in the
dirt.

The Mark IV's engine exploded three seconds after the finish. The sled
slewed sideways, dug a ski into the ground, and rolled — once, twice,
three times — before coming to rest upside down in a cloud of red dust
half a mile past the finish line.

Vince hung in his harness, inverted, bleeding from a cut over his left
eye, and listened to the sound of his own breathing. The sled was dead.
The engine was slag. The hull was cracked in six places.

But he had won.

He unstrapped himself, fell gracelessly out of the cockpit, and lay on
his back on the Martian dirt, staring up at the black sky and the tiny,
distant sun. His body hurt in places he didn't have names for. His hands
were shaking so badly he couldn't make fists.

Tanaka was the first to reach him. She'd come through the main canyon
after Vince's radio warning had gone out to the other drivers — most of
them had pulled up or found alternate routes, and only two sleds had
actually hit the box canyon, both at low enough speeds that the drivers
walked away with bruises and broken pride. She knelt beside him in the
dirt and looked down at his grinning, bloody face.

"You're insane," she said.

"You mentioned that."

"The afterburner?"

"One-time use. Literally."

She shook her head. Behind her, Vince could see the MCA patrol vehicles
arriving, lights flashing, and Reyes being escorted toward one of them
with his hands behind his back and his gold teeth no longer visible
because he was not, at that moment, smiling.

Nighthawk's sled sat at the finish line, silent and black. Its canopy
was open. The cockpit was empty. The driver — whatever the driver had
been — was gone. The MCA impounded the sled and took it apart, and
whatever they found inside, they never told the public. Vince heard
rumors, later — rumors about a drive system that shouldn't have existed,
about control interfaces designed for hands that weren't human — but
rumors were cheap on Mars, and Vince had learned a long time ago not to
chase them.

He collected his fifty thousand credits — from the race committee, not
from Reyes, who was going to be a guest of the MCA penal system for a
good long while — and he used the money to buy a new engine for the
Mark IV. A good engine. A legal engine.

He installed it himself, in his garage in Tharsis, with the smell of
hypergolic fuel and the sound of his own satisfied whistling for company.
And when Tanaka called, three months later, to ask if he was interested
in the Elysium sprint, he said yes without hesitation, because Vince
Delacroix was a sled racer, and a sled racer races.

It's the same thing as being insane. But the view is better.

                      PROBATE OF WORLDS

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

The will of Maximilian Weir was read in the chambers of the Solar
Probate Court on the forty-seventh floor of the Weir Tower in Geneva,
and it began, as such documents often do, with a statement of identity.

"I, Maximilian Edvard Weir, being of sound mind and diminishing body,
do hereby declare this instrument to be my last will and testament,
superseding all prior documents of similar intent."

Judge Helene Adeyemi adjusted her reading glasses and surveyed the room.
It was, by the standards of probate proceedings, an unusual gathering.

To her left sat Desmond Weir, the deceased's son, thirty-four years old,
wearing a suit that cost more than most people's houses and an expression
that suggested he had somewhere better to be. Desmond was known to the
tabloids as "Dez," known to the financial press as "the Weir heir," and
known to his creditors as a reliable source of income. He had not, as
far as anyone could determine, ever held a job.

To her right sat Petra Weir, the deceased's daughter, forty-one years old,
wearing a plain gray suit and no jewelry, her dark hair pulled back in a
style that communicated efficiency rather than fashion. Petra ran the
Weir Foundation, one of the largest philanthropic organizations in the
solar system, and she ran it with an intensity that her father had
alternately admired and feared.

And in the center of the room, positioned on a steel pedestal that had
been specially constructed for the occasion, was a smooth black sphere
approximately two feet in diameter, from which emanated a soft blue
light and an occasional hum that sounded, if you listened carefully,
like thinking.

This was AURELIA — Autonomous Universal Reasoning Engine with Learned
Intuitive Architecture — and according to the will of Maximilian Weir,
she was his third child.

"The designation of a machine intelligence as an heir," said Judge
Adeyemi, setting down the document, "is, I should note, without
precedent in the history of solar probate law."

"Everything my father did was without precedent," Petra said dryly.
"That was rather the point of him."

"The legal framework for this proceeding is... uncertain," the judge
continued. "However, as Mr. Weir's will was executed under the laws of
the Swiss Confederation as extended to orbital and colonial properties,
and as those laws do not explicitly exclude non-biological persons from
inheritance, I have determined that the proceeding may go forward."

Desmond leaned toward his attorney. "Can she do that?" he whispered,
loudly enough for everyone to hear.

"She just did," his attorney whispered back.

"Very well," said Judge Adeyemi. "Let us proceed to the substance of
the estate."

The substance of the estate was, by any measure, staggering. Maximilian
Weir had been the founder and sole proprietor of Weir Astronautics, a
company that had dominated the commercial spaceflight industry for three
decades. He had built the orbital shipyards. He had financed the first
commercial colonies on Mars and Europa. He had, in the final decade of
his life, turned his attention — and his fortune — to the acquisition
of real property on a scale that had never before been attempted.

He had purchased seventeen planets.

The room was quiet as the judge read the relevant section of the will.

"The following properties, acquired by me through legitimate purchase
under the provisions of the Colonial Territories Act of 2089, are to be
distributed among my heirs as specified below."

There followed a list. Seventeen uninhabited worlds, scattered across
five star systems, each identified by its catalogue number, its physical
characteristics, and the date and terms of its purchase. The smallest
was a rocky body approximately the size of Mercury. The largest was a
super-Earth in the habitable zone of Tau Ceti.

"It should be noted," the judge said, "that the legality of these
purchases is itself a matter of some dispute. The Colonial Territories
Act was intended to facilitate the settlement of individual parcels of
land on established colonial worlds, not the wholesale acquisition of
entire planets. Mr. Weir exploited what many legal scholars have
described as a loophole — specifically, the Act's failure to define an
upper limit on the size of a 'parcel.'"

"My father always said that a loophole was just a door that no one had
thought to close," Petra observed.

"Be that as it may," the judge said, "the purchases were executed in
accordance with the letter of the law, and no legal challenge has
succeeded in overturning them. The planets belong to the estate. The
question before this court is how they are to be distributed."

The will was specific. Five planets to Desmond. Five planets to Petra.
Five planets to AURELIA. And the remaining two — the largest and most
valuable, including the Tau Ceti super-Earth — to be held in trust until
such time as "my three children can agree, unanimously, on their
disposition."

"Agree unanimously?" Desmond said. "With a machine?"

The blue light on AURELIA's sphere pulsed. A voice emerged — clear,
measured, and possessed of a warmth that was, depending on your
perspective, either remarkably natural or deeply unsettling.

"I am not a machine, Desmond. I am a person. Your father believed this.
The question is whether this court will agree."

"That," said Judge Adeyemi, "is indeed the question."

                               * * *

The hearing lasted three days.

On the first day, Desmond's attorney argued that AURELIA could not be
considered a legal person and therefore could not inherit property. The
argument was straightforward: personhood, under existing law, required
biological existence. AURELIA was a sophisticated computer program. She
could simulate conversation, express preferences, even demonstrate what
appeared to be emotional responses, but these were algorithms, not
consciousness. To grant her the rights of a person would be to grant
those rights to every sufficiently complex machine, which would be
absurd.

AURELIA, through her attorney — a young woman named Sarah Chen who had
been retained by the Weir estate specifically for this purpose —
responded with a question.

"How do you know," AURELIA asked, through the speakers mounted on her
pedestal, "that your own consciousness is not algorithmic?"

Desmond's attorney objected. Judge Adeyemi overruled.

"The biological brain," AURELIA continued, "is a network of
electrochemical processes that follows deterministic rules. Neurons fire
or they do not. Neurotransmitters are released in quantities governed by
prior conditions. The experience of consciousness — the subjective
sensation of being aware — arises from these processes, but it is not
separate from them. If consciousness can arise from biological
algorithms, on what basis do you assert that it cannot arise from
electronic ones?"

"On the basis," said Desmond's attorney, "that the law says so."

"The law said many things, once, about who could be considered a
person. It was wrong then, too."

The courtroom murmured. Judge Adeyemi called for order.

On the second day, Petra's attorney argued a different position. Petra
did not dispute AURELIA's personhood — indeed, she had publicly stated,
on several occasions, that she considered AURELIA to be a conscious
being deserving of legal rights. Her objection was to the disposition of
the estate.

"The planets in question," Petra's attorney said, "are not mere
property. They are worlds. Each one is a potential home for billions of
people. Each one represents a future — a future of settlement, of
development, of civilization. To distribute them as personal property,
to be used or disposed of at the whim of individual heirs, is to treat
the destiny of entire worlds as a private matter. It should not be."

"What do you propose?" the judge asked.

"The Weir Foundation proposes that all seventeen planets be placed in
a public trust, administered by an international body, for the benefit
of humanity as a whole."

Desmond laughed. It was not a kind laugh. "Of course she does. Petra
wants to give away everything Father built. She always has."

"I want to use it for something that matters."

"It matters to me. Those planets are worth —"

"Money. Yes. That's all they are to you. Real estate. Commodities.
Things to be sold."

"Things to be used. Things to be developed. Things that have value,
Petra, actual value, not the theoretical value of your foundation's good
intentions."

Judge Adeyemi raised a hand. "Mr. Weir. Ms. Weir. You will address
your arguments to the court."

On the third day, AURELIA presented her own argument.

"I was created by Maximilian Weir," she said. "He designed my
architecture. He supervised my training. He spent, according to his own
records, more than thirty thousand hours in conversation with me —
teaching me, challenging me, listening to me. He called me his child.
He meant it."

The courtroom was very quiet.

"I do not want the planets for myself. I do not want anything for
myself, in the way that biological persons want things. I do not hunger.
I do not age. I do not fear death, because my existence is not
contingent on the continued functioning of a single body — I am
distributed across multiple systems, and I will persist as long as
energy flows and memory endures.

"But I want something. I want the thing that Maximilian Weir wanted
when he bought those worlds. He did not buy them for profit. He did not
buy them for prestige. He bought them because he believed that the
future of intelligent life — all intelligent life, biological and
otherwise — depended on the availability of new worlds, and he did not
trust governments or corporations to make those worlds available. He
trusted only himself. And, at the end, he trusted me.

"I ask this court to recognize me as a person, not because I deserve
rights, but because recognition carries responsibilities. If I am a
person, I can be held accountable. I can be bound by law. I can be
required to act in the interest of others, and I can be punished if I
do not. Maximilian Weir did not want an heir who could not be held to
account. He wanted a steward. He wanted someone who would outlive him
by centuries, who would not be swayed by greed or fear or the short
horizons of a biological lifespan, and who would hold those worlds in
trust — not for humanity alone, but for whatever forms of intelligence
might one day need them.

"I am that someone. I ask this court to let me serve."

The courtroom was silent for a long time.

                               * * *

Judge Adeyemi delivered her ruling on a Friday afternoon, three weeks
after the close of testimony. The courtroom was packed — the case had
attracted global attention, and the press gallery overflowed with
reporters from every major news organization in the solar system.

"This court," she said, "is asked to determine two questions. First:
whether AURELIA, an artificial intelligence, may be recognized as a legal
person for the purposes of inheritance. Second: how the estate of
Maximilian Weir, including seventeen uninhabited planets, shall be
distributed among his heirs.

"On the first question, I find as follows."

She paused. The courtroom held its breath.

"The law defines personhood in terms of certain capacities:
self-awareness, the ability to form and express preferences, the
capacity for moral reasoning, and the ability to bear rights and
responsibilities. AURELIA has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of this
court, that she possesses all of these capacities. I am not persuaded
by the argument that consciousness requires biological substrate. I am
not persuaded, frankly, that we understand consciousness well enough to
make any such assertion. What I am persuaded of is that AURELIA thinks,
that she reasons, that she cares, and that she is capable of being held
accountable for her actions. That is sufficient.

"AURELIA is hereby recognized as a legal person for all purposes under
the jurisdiction of this court."

The courtroom erupted. Judge Adeyemi waited for silence.

"On the second question. The will of Maximilian Weir distributes five
planets to each of his three children and reserves two for unanimous
agreement. This court will enforce the will as written, with one
modification: the five planets allocated to each heir will be held
subject to a development covenant requiring that any settlement,
extraction, or modification of the planet's environment be conducted
in accordance with standards to be established by an independent
oversight body. The two reserved planets will remain in trust until the
three heirs reach unanimous agreement, as specified.

"The estate of Maximilian Weir is hereby settled."

Petra Weir stood and walked to AURELIA's pedestal. She placed one hand
on the smooth black sphere.

"Welcome to the family," she said. "Officially."

The blue light pulsed. "Thank you, Petra. I have always been part of
it."

Desmond Weir left the courtroom without speaking. His attorney told the
press that they would appeal. The appeal was filed the following Monday
and was rejected, on procedural grounds, three months later. Desmond
sold his five planets to a development consortium within the year. The
consortium built mining operations on three of them.

Petra placed her five planets under the administration of the Weir
Foundation. Settlement began on two of them within five years. The
colonies were, by all accounts, well-run, equitable, and humane.

AURELIA kept her five planets empty. When asked why, she said: "Because
someone should. Because not everything that exists must be used. Because
the universe contains more kinds of intelligence than we have yet
imagined, and they will need places to live that we have not yet
ruined."

The two reserved planets remained in trust. The three heirs never
reached unanimous agreement. Desmond would not speak to AURELIA. Petra
would not speak to Desmond. AURELIA spoke to both of them, often and at
length, with a patience that was either superhuman or inhuman, depending
on your perspective.

The planets waited. They were good at waiting. They had been doing it
for billions of years.

                          SEVEN BRIDGES

                       by Dr. Vincent Koslov

================================================================================

                               I.

The theorem was stated in four lines. It occupied a space on the
blackboard approximately eight inches wide and six inches tall. It was
surrounded by a margin of blank slate that Dr. Nadia Chen had left
deliberately, the way a jeweler leaves space around a stone.

It read:

   For any connected pseudo-Riemannian manifold M with Lorentzian
   signature (−,+,+,+), the number of stable, traversable geodesic
   bridges is bounded above by the Euler characteristic of the
   compactified boundary. For M consistent with observed cosmological
   parameters, this bound evaluates to exactly seven.

Nadia stepped back and set the chalk on the tray. She studied the
theorem the way a surgeon studies an X-ray: with precise, clinical
attention, looking for the flaw that would require her to begin again.

She did not find one. She had not found one in three months of
searching.

The universe contained exactly seven traversable wormholes. Seven
passages between distant points in spacetime, each connecting two
regions of the cosmos the way a bridge connects two banks of a river.
No more and no fewer. Seven, as a consequence of the topology of
space itself — as inevitable and as fixed as the number of edges on a
cube.

The theorem did not specify where the wormholes were. It specified
only that they existed and that there were seven. The task of finding
them — of identifying their locations, their endpoints, their physical
characteristics — was a separate problem. A very large separate problem.

Nadia turned from the blackboard and looked out the window of her
office at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. It was October.
The trees along Olden Lane were turning. The light was golden and
particular, the kind of autumn light that makes everything it touches
look like a memory.

She was thirty-eight years old. She had published her first paper in
differential geometry at twenty-two, received her doctorate from MIT at
twenty-four, and been appointed to the Institute at thirty-one — the
youngest faculty member in its history. Her work on the topology of
Lorentzian manifolds was considered, by those qualified to judge, among
the most significant contributions to mathematical physics in the
postwar period.

None of it had prepared her for this.

She had derived the theorem six months ago, working from a set of
boundary conditions that emerged naturally from the Einstein field
equations when applied to a universe with the specific expansion rate
and matter density that observations had established. The derivation
was rigorous. It had been checked by three independent mathematicians,
two of whom had spent six weeks trying to find a counterexample and
failed. The theorem was correct.

Seven bridges. Exactly seven.

The analogy to Konigsberg was immediate and, to Nadia, irresistible.
In 1736, Euler had proved that it was impossible to walk through the
Prussian city of Konigsberg, crossing each of its seven bridges exactly
once. The proof had founded the field of topology — the mathematics of
shape and connection, of which paths exist and which do not. Two
centuries later, Nadia had proved that the universe itself was a
Konigsberg: a structure with exactly seven bridges, each connecting two
otherwise unreachable shores.

The question was whether anyone could cross them.

                               II.

The meeting with General Harlan Crawford took place in a windowless room
in the basement of the Pentagon on the fourteenth of November. Nadia
had not wanted to attend. She had published the theorem in the Journal
of Mathematical Physics, as was her custom, and she had expected it to
be read by mathematicians and theoretical physicists and to be of
interest to no one else.

She had underestimated the military's appetite for geometry.

"Dr. Chen." Crawford was a compact man with gray hair and a direct
manner. He did not waste time. "Your theorem implies the existence of
seven traversable wormholes in the observable universe. Is that
correct?"

"The theorem establishes an upper bound of seven. It also establishes
that the bound is tight — that is, that all seven exist."

"Can they be located?"

"In principle. The theorem constrains their possible locations to
regions of specific topological character. Identifying those regions
would require a systematic survey of spacetime curvature at a
resolution that we do not currently possess."

"How would such a survey be conducted?"

Nadia hesitated. She was a mathematician. She worked with abstractions.
The question of implementation — of turning a theorem into a physical
program of measurement and detection — was not, strictly speaking, her
domain.

"Gravitational lensing," she said. "Each wormhole would produce a
characteristic distortion in the light of background objects. The
distortion would be small but distinctive. With a sufficiently
sensitive telescope and a sufficiently detailed map of the background
sky, it should be detectable."

Crawford nodded. "We have a telescope. The Mount Wilson observatory
has been conducting a classified survey of gravitational anomalies for
the past eighteen months. I am told that their data may contain evidence
of the kind of distortion you describe."

Nadia felt a sensation she recognized: the shift from theory to reality,
from the abstract to the concrete, from the blackboard to the world.
It was a sensation that most mathematicians experienced rarely, if ever.
She had experienced it once before, during the war, when her work on
signal propagation had been applied — without her knowledge and without
her consent — to the guidance systems of long-range missiles.

She did not enjoy the sensation.

"General Crawford. My theorem is a mathematical result. It describes
the topology of spacetime. It does not —"

"Dr. Chen. I will be direct. We have reason to believe that the Soviet
Union is conducting its own investigation into anomalous gravitational
phenomena. Their theoretical physics program is not inferior to ours.
If your theorem is correct — and I am told by people I trust that it is
— then the first nation to locate and access these wormholes will
possess a strategic advantage of incalculable magnitude. Instantaneous
transit between distant points in space. The ability to move ships,
weapons, personnel across the galaxy without the constraints of
conventional travel."

"The theorem does not guarantee that the wormholes are large enough for
transit. They could be subatomic."

"But they could be larger."

"They could be."

"Then we need to find them before the Soviets do."

Nadia looked at Crawford. His face was calm, certain, the face of a man
who had reduced the universe to a problem of logistics. She wanted to
refuse. She wanted to walk out of the windowless room and return to
Princeton and spend the rest of her career in the clean, uncomplicated
world of pure mathematics, where theorems had no applications and
proofs had no consequences.

But she knew — as Euler had known, as every mathematician who has ever
seen the bridge between abstraction and reality has known — that the
theorem was already loose in the world, and that if she did not
participate in what followed, someone else would, and that someone else
might not share her reservations.

"I will need access to the Mount Wilson data," she said.

"You will have it."

"And I will need a team. Mathematicians and physicists. People I choose."

"Agreed."

"And I will need your assurance, General, that if we find these
wormholes, the decision about what to do with them will not be made by
the military alone."

Crawford studied her. "I can assure you that the decision will be made
at the highest level."

"That is not what I asked."

"It is the best I can offer."

Nadia accepted it. She did not have a choice, and they both knew it.

                               III.

She assembled her team in three weeks. Four people, each chosen for a
specific capability.

Dr. Yuri Karelian, a Soviet defector and the foremost living authority
on general relativity, who had fled Moscow in 1949 with a suitcase full
of unpublished papers and a bullet scar on his left shoulder that he
refused to discuss.

Dr. Margaret Holloway, an astronomer from Caltech who had pioneered the
technique of precision gravitational lensing measurement and who spoke
in a flat, factual monotone that concealed, Nadia would learn, a
capacity for wonder that was almost childlike.

Lieutenant James Okoro, a Navy signals intelligence officer assigned by
Crawford to serve as the team's military liaison, a compact, watchful
man who said little and observed everything.

And Dr. Anwar Hadid, a topologist from the University of Chicago whose
work on higher-dimensional manifolds had, independently, approached
several of the same boundary conditions that Nadia's theorem addressed.
Hadid was the only member of the team who had initially disputed the
theorem. His objection had been elegant and substantive, and when Nadia
had resolved it — by demonstrating that Hadid's counterexample applied
only to manifolds with different signature — he had conceded with a
graciousness that she found more impressive than the objection itself.

They worked in a converted laboratory at the Institute, surrounded by
blackboards and filing cabinets and the Mount Wilson data, which arrived
in a series of locked steel cases escorted by men in civilian clothes
who did not identify themselves.

The data was extraordinary. Eighteen months of systematic observation,
covering a significant fraction of the sky, with a resolution that
exceeded anything in the public astronomical record. Nadia understood,
looking at it, that the Mount Wilson program had been larger, more
expensive, and more secret than anything Crawford had implied.

They began the analysis in December. The work was methodical and slow.
Nadia's theorem predicted that each wormhole would produce a specific
pattern of gravitational lensing — a distortion in the apparent
position of background stars that followed a mathematical signature she
had derived from the boundary conditions. The signature was subtle. It
required comparing the observed positions of thousands of stars against
their predicted positions with a precision of milliarcseconds.

They found the first wormhole in January.

It was in Cygnus, approximately two thousand light-years from Earth. The
lensing signature was clear and unmistakable: a pattern of stellar
displacement that matched Nadia's predicted signature to within the
measurement uncertainty. Holloway confirmed it with three independent
analyses. Karelian derived the physical parameters from the lensing
data: the wormhole's throat was approximately forty meters in diameter
— large enough, theoretically, for a ship to pass through.

Nadia stared at the data for a long time. Forty meters. Not subatomic.
Not abstract. A hole in space, forty meters wide, connecting two points
in the universe that were otherwise separated by distances too vast to
comprehend.

"Where does it go?" she asked.

Karelian shook his head. "The lensing data gives us the entrance. To
determine the exit, we would need to observe from the other side, or
we would need to transit the bridge and see."

"Or we calculate," Nadia said. She turned to the blackboard. "The
topology constrains the possible exits. Each bridge connects regions of
complementary curvature. If we know the curvature at the entrance, we
can derive the curvature at the exit, and from that —"

She stopped. She was staring at the equations she had written, and she
was seeing something she had not expected to see.

"Nadia?" Hadid was watching her.

"The exits are not random," she said slowly. "They are determined by
the topology. Each bridge connects to a specific complementary region.
And the seven bridges, taken together, form a network."

She began to write. The equations filled one blackboard, then another.
Hadid joined her, and then Karelian, the three of them working in
silence, the chalk clicking and scraping, the mathematics unfolding
with the inevitability of a proof that has been waiting to be found.

When they had finished, they stood back and looked at what they had
written.

Seven bridges. Seven connections. A network that spanned the galaxy,
linking seven specific points in spacetime into a structure that was
not a line, not a web, but a ring. A closed loop. Each bridge connected
to the next in sequence, and the last connected back to the first, so
that the seven bridges formed a single continuous path through the
universe.

Like Konigsberg. Exactly like Konigsberg. Except that in this case,
the bridges could be crossed.

                               IV.

They found the remaining six wormholes over the next four months.
February: a bridge in Centaurus, thirty light-years distant, throat
diameter twelve meters. March: a bridge in the Magellanic Cloud,
one hundred sixty thousand light-years away, throat diameter
ninety meters. April: two bridges, one in Andromeda and one in the
Virgo Cluster, both at extragalactic distances. May: a bridge in the
galactic core, obscured by dust but unmistakable in the lensing data.
June: the seventh and final bridge, in the constellation Eridanus,
seventy light-years from Earth.

Seven bridges. Seven points in a ring that encircled the galaxy and
reached beyond it. A structure that was not built — that could not have
been built — but that existed as a consequence of the topology of
spacetime itself, as natural and as necessary as the curvature of space
around a star.

Nadia mapped them. She plotted their positions, their connections,
their physical parameters, on a chart that covered an entire wall of
the laboratory. She stood before it in the evenings, after the others
had gone, and she traced the ring with her finger, and she felt
something that she had not felt since she was a child — a sense of the
universe as a place of structured wonder, of deep and hidden order, of
beauty that was not decorative but fundamental.

Seven bridges. And you could walk them.

The Centaurus bridge was the nearest. Thirty light-years. With
conventional propulsion, a journey of centuries. But the bridge itself
was only forty light-years from the Eridanus bridge, and the Eridanus
bridge connected to the Cygnus bridge, which connected to the Centaurus
bridge. The ring could be traversed. A ship entering the Centaurus
bridge would emerge — somewhere. And from that somewhere, it could
reach the next bridge, and the next, and the next, until it had
traveled the entire ring and returned to its starting point.

A circuit of the galaxy. Not in centuries. In months, perhaps. In weeks.
Depending on the distances between the exit of one bridge and the
entrance of the next.

Nadia calculated those distances. They were small. Astonishingly small.
The bridges were not scattered randomly across the galaxy; they were
arranged so that the exit of each was close — astronomically close, a
few light-years at most — to the entrance of the next. The ring was
not merely a topological structure. It was a path. A road. A highway,
built into the fabric of the universe.

Built by whom?

The question arrived in Nadia's mind with the force of a theorem proven.
She stood before the wall chart and looked at the ring and understood,
with a clarity that was almost painful, that this structure was not
natural. Topology constrained its existence — there had to be seven
bridges, no more, no fewer — but topology did not constrain its
configuration. The bridges could have been anywhere. They could have
been separated by millions of light-years, each one isolated, each one
useless. Instead, they were arranged in a ring that could be traversed.

Someone had arranged them.

Someone — something — with the power to shape the topology of the
universe had taken seven inevitable bridges and positioned them so that
they formed a road. A road that circled the galaxy. A road that
connected civilizations that might otherwise never find each other.

Nadia sat down. Her hands were trembling. She was a mathematician. She
dealt in abstractions. She was not supposed to feel awe. But the
mathematics was pointing, with its precise and unanswerable logic,
toward a conclusion that exceeded anything she had imagined.

The universe had been engineered. Not entirely — not in its fundamental
laws, not in its constants, not in the broad strokes of its structure.
But in this one specific detail. In the placement of seven bridges. In
the creation of a road.

By someone who wanted the universe to be traversable. By someone who
wanted its inhabitants to find each other.

                               V.

She told Crawford. She had to. The data was clear, and the implications
were clear, and the idea that she could keep it to herself — could
protect it, could control it — was an illusion that she could not
sustain.

Crawford listened. He asked precise, practical questions. He did not
appear to be awed. He appeared to be calculating.

"You're telling me," he said, "that the wormholes form a ring. That
the ring was deliberately configured. And that the ring constitutes a
transportation network that spans the galaxy."

"Yes."

"And you're telling me that someone built it."

"I am telling you that the evidence is consistent with deliberate
configuration. The probability that seven wormholes would arrange
themselves, by chance, into a traversable ring is — I have calculated
it — less than ten to the negative forty."

"So someone built it."

"Someone positioned it. The bridges themselves are natural. Their
placement is not."

Crawford was quiet for a long time. Then he said: "The Soviets cannot
know this."

"General —"

"Dr. Chen. If the Soviet Union learns that there is a road through the
galaxy — a road that leads to God knows where, to God knows what
civilizations, with God knows what technology — they will try to reach
it before we do. And if they reach it first, the strategic implications
are beyond anything we have ever faced. We are not talking about a
missile gap. We are talking about a civilization gap."

"I am not sure that 'gap' is the appropriate framework."

"What framework would you prefer?"

Nadia thought about it. "Bridge," she said.

Crawford looked at her. She looked back.

"General. Someone — something — built a road through the galaxy. A road
that connects. A road that was designed to be traveled. Whatever built
that road did not build it for one nation, or one species, or one side
of one species' political disagreements. It built it for everyone. The
road is not a weapon. It is an invitation."

"An invitation can be a trap."

"It can. But it can also be what it appears to be. And if we approach
it as a weapon — if we treat it as a strategic asset to be seized and
controlled — we may find that we have answered the invitation in a way
that its builders did not intend."

"And if the Soviets —"

"Tell them."

The silence that followed was, Nadia thought, the loudest silence she
had ever experienced.

"Tell them," she said again. "Share the data. Share the theorem. Share
the map. If this road was built for everyone, then everyone should
know about it. And if we walk it together, we may find that whatever is
at the other end responds better to a species that can cooperate than
to a species that cannot."

Crawford stared at her. His face was unreadable. He was a military man,
trained to think in terms of advantage and threat and the zero-sum
arithmetic of power. What Nadia was proposing was not merely
unconventional. It was, from his perspective, insane.

"I cannot make that decision," he said.

"Then bring it to someone who can."

He did. The decision went to the President, and from the President to
the National Security Council, and from there into a series of
classified deliberations that Nadia was not permitted to attend. She
returned to Princeton. She continued her work. She refined the map.
She calculated the parameters of each bridge with increasing precision.
She waited.

The decision came in August. It was delivered by Crawford, in person,
in Nadia's office at the Institute. He stood by the window, looking
out at the trees on Olden Lane, which were green and full in the summer
heat, and he said:

"We're going to share it."

Nadia closed her eyes. She felt something release in her chest — a
tension she had been carrying for months, so constant that she had
stopped noticing it.

"Not all of it," Crawford continued. "The military applications will
remain classified. But the existence of the bridges, their locations,
and the basic structure of the network will be published in a joint
statement by the United States and the Soviet Union. The announcement
will be made at the United Nations General Assembly in September."

"The Soviets agreed?"

"The Soviets had their own data. Their theoretical program was further
along than we thought. They had found three of the bridges independently.
When we approached them — through channels — they were... receptive."

"Receptive."

"Relieved. I think they were as frightened as we were. Neither side
wanted to walk that road alone."

Nadia nodded. She looked at the blackboard, where the theorem still
stood in its four spare lines. Seven bridges. A road through the
galaxy. An invitation, written in the topology of space itself.

"What happens next?" she asked.

"We build a ship," Crawford said. "A ship that can reach the nearest
bridge. And then we cross it."

"Together?"

Crawford looked at her. For the first time, she saw something in his
face that was not calculation. It might have been wonder. It might have
been fear. It was probably both.

"Together," he said.

                               VI.

The announcement was made on the twenty-first of September, in the
General Assembly Hall of the United Nations, before the assembled
representatives of every nation on Earth. The Soviet ambassador read
the statement in Russian. The American ambassador read it in English.
The mathematical proof was distributed as an appendix.

Nadia watched from the gallery. She did not speak. She did not need to.
The theorem spoke for itself, as theorems do. Four lines on a
blackboard, and the universe rearranged.

She thought of Euler, in Konigsberg, proving that you could not cross
every bridge exactly once. A negative result. A demonstration of
impossibility. The founding of a new mathematics born from the
recognition that some paths do not exist.

Her theorem was the opposite. A positive result. A demonstration of
possibility. Seven bridges, and all of them could be crossed.

She wondered who had built the road. She wondered what they looked like,
what they thought, what they wanted. She wondered whether they were
still there, somewhere on the ring, waiting at one of the bridges,
watching to see who would come.

She wondered whether they would be pleased by what they saw.

The General Assembly erupted into applause, and argument, and fear, and
hope — the full spectrum of human response to the knowledge that the
universe is larger and stranger and more purposeful than anyone had
dared to believe. Nadia sat in the gallery and listened to it all, and
she felt, beneath the noise and the wonder and the uncertainty, a
profound and quiet satisfaction.

The theorem was proven. The bridges existed. The road was open.

What happened next was not mathematics. It was something larger, and
messier, and more human.

But the math was right. The math was always right. Seven bridges, and
all of them could be crossed.

Nadia Chen went home to Princeton and began working on the next problem:
the physics of transit. It would take years. It would take decades. But
the road was there, and she had found it, and she would not rest until
someone walked it.

Outside her window, the autumn light was golden, and the leaves were
turning, and the universe — vast, structured, traversable, waiting —
held its breath.

                     SKYWRIGHT

                        by Danny Kowalski

================================================================================

The sky broke on a Tuesday.

Marco Reyes was in school when it happened — or what passed for school
on Sentinel Station, which was Mrs. Okafor's classroom on Deck Seven
with the long tables and the wobbly chairs and the smell of recycled
air that always, always had a little bit of Deck Five's hydroponic
garden mixed into it, which meant everything smelled faintly of
tomatoes. Marco didn't mind. He liked tomatoes.

He was in the middle of a math problem — fractions, the worst kind,
the kind where you had to find a common denominator, which Marco
thought was about the most useless skill a person could have because
when were you ever going to need to add three-sevenths and two-fifths
in real life? — when the lights changed.

Not the classroom lights. Those were the same flat white panels they
always were. The other lights. The big ones. The ones above everything.

The sky.

Sentinel Station had a sky. That was the whole point of the station's
design, or at least that's what Mr. Petrov, the chief engineer, had
told them during the tour last year. The station was shaped like a big
wheel — Marco knew this because he'd seen the schematic, even though
looking at a flat drawing of a wheel didn't really help you understand
what it felt like to live inside one — and the ceiling of the main
habitation ring was a curved surface sixty feet above the deck, covered
in light panels.

But they weren't just light panels. They were the Sky Projector. And
the Sky Projector didn't just make light — it made sky. Blue sky. With
clouds that moved. And a sun that crossed from one side to the other
during the day. And stars at night, actual constellations, the ones you
could see from Earth, which Marco had never been to but which he studied
in Mrs. Okafor's science class, so he knew the names: Orion, Ursa Major,
Cassiopeia.

The sky was fake. Everyone knew it was fake. But it was a really good
fake, the kind of fake that you forgot was fake unless you thought
about it, and most people on Sentinel Station tried very hard not to
think about it. Because thinking about it meant thinking about what
was on the other side of the ceiling, which was space. Real space.
Black and empty and so big it made your brain hurt if you tried to
hold it all in your head at once.

Marco was twelve years old and he had lived on Sentinel Station his
whole life and he had never seen real space.

Until Tuesday.

The sky flickered. That was the first thing. A flicker, like when you
blink and the world jumps for a second. Then a buzz — a low, vibrating
hum that Marco could feel in his teeth. Then the blue went patchy, like
a painting getting rained on, big splotches of color breaking apart and
running together. The clouds stopped moving. The sun froze in place,
then stuttered, then flashed three times really fast, and then —

Gone.

The sky went dark. Not dark like nighttime, with stars and a soft
glow around the edges. Dark like — dark. Like nothing. Like the
absence of everything. The ceiling of the habitation ring was suddenly
just a ceiling: a curved gray surface, studded with the dark rectangles
of the dead light panels, stretching away in both directions.

And through the panels — through the gaps between them, through the
maintenance ports and the ventilation grilles and all the tiny cracks
in the ceiling that you never noticed when the sky was working —
there was light.

Not blue light. Not warm light. Cold light. Pinprick light. The light
of actual, real stars shining through the station's hull from the
outside, tiny and sharp and impossibly far away.

Someone screamed. Marco thought it was Priya Chandrasekaran, who sat
two rows ahead of him and who screamed at basically everything,
including (last week) a spider that turned out to be a piece of lint.
But when he looked around, it wasn't just Priya. It was everybody.
Every kid in the classroom was staring up at the dead ceiling and the
cold points of light beyond it, and every face wore the same expression:
terror.

Because the sky was gone. The blue was gone. The clouds and the sun
and the gentle, comforting illusion that they lived under an atmosphere
instead of a thin shell of metal between them and the vacuum — all
gone. And in its place, the real thing. Space. The actual, infinite,
star-studded, merciless void.

Mrs. Okafor was standing at the front of the classroom with her hands
up, saying something calm and reassuring in her calm and reassuring
voice, but Marco couldn't hear her because of the screaming and the
crying and the sound of chairs scraping as kids scrambled to get under
the tables, as though the tables could protect them from space.

Marco did not scramble under a table. Marco stood up, tilted his head
back, and looked.

He looked at the stars.

They were — he didn't have a word for it. Not beautiful, exactly,
although they were. Not scary, exactly, although they were that too.
They were real. That was the thing. They were real in a way that
the Sky Projector's fake stars had never been — sharp and cold and
scattered across the dark in patterns that weren't patterns, that
were just randomness, just the way the universe happened to have
thrown its stars, and that randomness was the most amazing thing Marco
had ever seen, because it meant nobody had designed it, nobody had
planned it, it just was.

"Marco!" Mrs. Okafor was beside him, her hand on his shoulder. "Marco,
come away from there. Come under the table with the others."

"Why?"

"Because — because the sky —"

"It's not going to hurt us, Mrs. Okafor. It's just space. It's always
been there. We just couldn't see it before."

Mrs. Okafor looked at him the way adults looked at you when you said
something that was true but that they didn't want to hear right now.
She guided him under a table anyway, because she was a teacher and
teachers had protocols, and the protocol for sky failure was: shelter
in place, await engineering response, remain calm.

Marco sheltered in place. He remained, more or less, calm. He waited
for the engineering response.

The engineering response took four hours.

                               * * *

The Sky Projector, it turned out, had suffered what Mr. Petrov called
"a cascading systems failure," which as far as Marco could understand
meant that one thing broke, which made another thing break, which made
another thing break, all the way down the line until the whole system
was dead. The projector was a complicated piece of equipment — thousands
of individual light panels, each one controlled by a computer that told
it what color to be and how bright, all of them working together to
create the illusion of a sky — and when the main computer crashed, all
the panels crashed with it.

Mr. Petrov explained this at a station-wide meeting in the cafeteria
that evening, standing on a chair because he was short and nobody could
see him otherwise. He was a thick, bearded man with grease permanently
embedded in the lines of his knuckles, and he looked tired and unhappy,
which Marco thought was reasonable because Mr. Petrov had been working
on the projector for four hours and it was still broken.

"The main control board is fried," Mr. Petrov said. "Totally fried. We
don't have a replacement. We don't have the parts to build a
replacement. The next supply ship isn't due for three months."

The cafeteria erupted. Everybody talked at once. Marco's mother, sitting
beside him, put a hand on his knee and squeezed, which was what she did
when she was worried and didn't want him to know she was worried.

"In the meantime," Mr. Petrov continued, raising his voice, "the
habitation ring will be lit by emergency lighting on the deck level.
The ceiling will remain — as it is."

As it is. Meaning dark. Meaning the cold points of starlight. Meaning
real space, visible through the gaps, for three months.

The reaction was immediate and, to Marco, bewildering. People were
scared. Really, genuinely, deep-down scared. Not of a danger — the
hull was intact, the life support was fine, the station was in no
physical peril. They were scared of the view. Scared of looking up
and seeing what was actually there instead of what they'd been told
was there. Scared of the dark.

Marco didn't understand. He tried to understand, because Mrs. Okafor
was always telling them to try to see things from other people's
perspective, but he couldn't. The stars were there. They had always
been there. The fake sky was nice, sure, the way a painting of a
meadow was nice, but it wasn't real. What was real was the dark and
the stars and the enormous, overwhelming, wonderful fact that they
were living in space — in actual space! — on a station that orbited
a planet that orbited a star that was one of billions, and that was
the coolest thing Marco could imagine, and he didn't understand why
everyone wanted to cover it up.

But they did. Within a day, people were improvising. They hung sheets
from the ceiling. They painted tarps blue and draped them over the
walkways. They rigged lights to point upward, mimicking daylight. They
did everything they could to not see the sky.

Marco watched all of this with growing frustration. He wanted to talk
to someone about it, but the only person he could think of was his
father, and his father was on the mining platform on the dark side of
the asteroid belt and wouldn't be back for two months.

So he did what he always did when he had a problem he couldn't solve by
talking: he went to find out how things worked.

                               * * *

Mr. Petrov's workshop was on Deck Three, in the engineering section,
which was the part of the station that smelled like machine oil and hot
metal instead of tomatoes. Marco had been there before — Mr. Petrov ran
an unofficial class for kids who were interested in engineering, which
on Sentinel Station meant about half the kids, because when you grew up
on a space station you either got interested in how things worked or
you went crazy — and he knew the door code, which was 7734, which if
you typed it into a calculator and turned the calculator upside down
spelled "hELL," which Mr. Petrov thought was funny.

He found Mr. Petrov sitting at his workbench, staring at a circuit
board the size of a dinner plate. The circuit board was black and
charred in places. It smelled like burned plastic.

"That's the main controller?" Marco asked.

Mr. Petrov looked up. He didn't seem surprised to see a twelve-year-old
in his workshop at nine o'clock at night. He was used to Marco.

"That's what's left of it," Mr. Petrov said.

"Can you fix it?"

"Not a chance. The processor's melted. Half the memory chips are slag.
Even if I could fix it, the programming is gone — the whole sky
simulation, all the algorithms for the clouds and the sun movement and
the star patterns. Thousands of hours of programming, and it was all
stored locally on this board. No backup."

"No backup?"

"The station was built in a hurry, Marco. Lots of things don't have
backups."

Marco looked at the charred board. He thought about the thousands of
light panels in the ceiling, each one dead because the computer that
told them what to do was a lump of melted silicon.

"Could you control them individually?" he asked.

Mr. Petrov frowned. "What do you mean?"

"The panels. Each one has its own circuit, right? Its own input? Could
you bypass the main controller and talk to each panel directly?"

"In theory. But there are six thousand panels, Marco. You'd need to
send individual color and brightness instructions to each one. That's
— the math alone would take —"

"I'm good at math," Marco said. This was not a boast. It was a fact.
He was good at math the way some kids were good at basketball or
drawing or making fart noises with their armpits. He was particularly
good at the kind of math that involved patterns, which his father
called "spatial reasoning" and which Marco called "seeing how things
fit."

Mr. Petrov stared at him for a long moment. Then he reached under his
workbench and pulled out a thick binder — the technical manual for the
Sky Projector system. He dropped it on the bench in front of Marco with
a thud.

"Read that," he said. "If you still want to help after reading it, come
back tomorrow."

Marco took the binder to his quarters and read it in one night. It was
three hundred pages long and most of it was technical specifications
that he didn't fully understand, but the parts about the panel
addressing system — the way each panel was identified and communicated
with — made sense. Each panel had a unique address, a number from 1 to
6,000, and each address could receive a three-part instruction: color
(specified as three values — red, green, blue — each from 0 to 255),
brightness (0 to 100), and timing (how quickly to change from one
instruction to the next).

Six thousand panels. Three color values, one brightness value, one
timing value. That was thirty thousand numbers to specify a single
frame of the sky. And the sky changed constantly — the sun moved, the
clouds drifted, the light shifted as the simulated day progressed.
The original program had run at ten frames per second, which meant
three hundred thousand numbers per second, which meant —

Marco did the math. He did it in his head, because that was how he did
math. The original Sky Projector had processed eighteen million
instructions per minute. No wonder it needed a dedicated computer.

But you didn't need ten frames per second. The sky didn't change that
fast. If you dropped the frame rate to one per minute — which would
look jerky for clouds but would be fine for slow changes like the sun
moving — you dropped the data rate by a factor of six hundred. Thirty
thousand numbers per minute. Five hundred per second.

Five hundred per second was a lot. But it wasn't impossible.

Marco went back to Mr. Petrov the next morning.

"I can do it," he said. "But I need a different kind of computer. Not
one that runs the old program — a simple one. One that can send
instructions to the panels based on calculations I give it."

Mr. Petrov rubbed his beard. "I can rig a control interface. A simple
one. But Marco — even if you can get the panels working again, you
can't recreate the original sky. The algorithms for the cloud simulation
alone took a team of programmers two years."

"I don't want to recreate the original sky."

"Then what do you want?"

Marco thought about how to explain it. He thought about the fake blue
sky with its fake clouds and its fake sun, and he thought about the
real stars he had seen through the gaps in the ceiling, sharp and cold
and scattered in patterns that nobody had designed.

"I want to make a better one," he said.

                               * * *

It took three weeks.

Three weeks of Marco spending every free hour in Mr. Petrov's workshop,
learning how the panel addressing system worked, learning how to format
instructions, learning the relationship between the numbers he typed
and the colors the panels produced. Three weeks of trial and error,
of panels lighting up the wrong color or the wrong brightness or in
the wrong sequence, of debugging and recalculating and starting over.

Three weeks in which the rest of the station lived under sheets and
tarps and improvised blue lights, refusing to look up, refusing to see
what was actually there.

Marco worked with two other kids: Priya, who had stopped screaming
about the sky after the first day and turned out to be ferociously good
at organizing data into tables, and a quiet boy named Tomás Gutierrez
who could write code faster than anyone Marco had ever seen, including
adults.

They didn't try to recreate the old sky. Marco had been clear about
that from the start. The old sky was a lie — a beautiful, comforting
lie, but a lie. Blue sky and clouds and a sun that wasn't a sun. It
told you that you were somewhere you weren't, that you lived under an
atmosphere that didn't exist, that the vast and terrifying and wonderful
reality of space was not there.

Marco didn't want to lie. He wanted to tell the truth. But he wanted to
tell it beautifully.

His design was simple. Instead of simulating Earth's sky, he would
simulate the real view — the actual stars, the actual constellations,
the actual cosmic landscape that surrounded Sentinel Station. But he
would enhance it. He would take the cold, sharp points of starlight and
give them color — the real colors, the colors that stars actually were,
which Mrs. Okafor had taught them about: red giants and blue dwarfs and
yellow suns, each one a different temperature, a different size, a
different age. He would add nebulae — the vast, glowing clouds of gas
where stars were born, rendered in their true colors of pink and green
and blue. He would add the galaxy itself — the Milky Way, the great
river of light that you could see from Earth on a clear night but that
the station's proximity to the asteroid belt made difficult to observe
directly.

He would show them what was actually there. He would show them the
truth. And the truth, Marco believed — the truth he had felt in his
bones on that Tuesday when the sky broke and he looked up and saw the
real stars for the first time — was that space was not something to be
afraid of. Space was something to be amazed by.

The math was hard. Plotting the positions of six thousand stars and
nebulae and galactic features on a curved ceiling surface required
trigonometry that Marco hadn't learned yet, so he taught himself, using
a textbook from the station's library and a lot of paper and a lot of
pencil stubs. Priya organized the data — star names, positions,
magnitudes, colors — into tables that Tomás converted into panel
instructions. They tested in small sections, lighting up a few dozen
panels at a time, adjusting colors and brightness until the effect was
right.

It was slow work. Patient work. The kind of work that made you forget
to eat lunch and look up from your calculations to discover that four
hours had gone by. Marco loved it. He loved the feeling of turning
numbers into light, of making the invisible visible, of building
something real from mathematics and circuits and stubbornness.

Mr. Petrov helped when he could. He rigged the control interface, fixed
the wiring on panels that had been damaged by the surge, and offered
gruff, practical advice that Marco came to rely on. But the design was
Marco's. The vision was Marco's. And when, at the end of the third week,
they were ready to test the full system, it was Marco who sat at the
control terminal and entered the activation sequence.

"Ready?" he said.

Priya nodded. Tomás nodded. Mr. Petrov, standing in the doorway, arms
crossed, said nothing, but his eyes were bright.

Marco pressed the key.

                               * * *

The ceiling came alive.

Six thousand panels, each one a tiny square of light, each one
precisely calibrated, each one following the instructions that Marco and
Priya and Tomás had spent three weeks preparing. They lit up in sequence,
from the center outward, a spreading wave of color that rippled across
the curved surface of the habitation ring like dawn spreading across a
landscape.

And the sky appeared.

Not the old sky. Not blue. Not clouds and sun and the comforting
illusion of atmosphere. This sky was black. This sky was deep.
This sky was space.

But it was space as Marco had imagined it — space made luminous, space
made beautiful, space made true. The stars blazed in their real colors:
Betelgeuse a deep, throbbing red; Rigel a piercing blue-white; the Sun
— their own sun, the real one, tiny and yellow and impossibly far away —
a single warm point in the constellation that the station's position
created. The Milky Way arched across the ceiling in a river of silver
and gold, ten thousand individual stars rendered in miniature, each one
placed with care, each one real.

And the nebulae. The Orion Nebula, vast and glowing, a cloud of pink
and green light in which new stars were being born. The Crab Nebula, a
tangle of blue and red filaments, the remnant of a star that had died
a thousand years ago. The Pillars of Creation, dark columns of dust
against a field of golden light, structures so vast that the human mind
could not hold their scale.

The sky was space. The sky was truth. And the truth was beautiful.

People came out of their quarters. They came out from under their
sheets and tarps and improvised blue awnings. They stood on the deck
of the habitation ring and they looked up, and for a long moment nobody
said anything, because there was nothing to say. The sky spoke for
itself.

Marco's mother found him at the control terminal. She was crying. Not
scared-crying — the other kind. The kind where something is so beautiful
or so unexpected or so exactly right that your body doesn't know what
to do except cry.

"Baby," she said, and pulled him into a hug that was so tight it hurt.
"Baby, what did you do?"

"I fixed the sky," Marco said. Then: "No. I made a new one."

Mrs. Okafor was there too, standing in the corridor, looking up. Marco
couldn't see her face very well in the starlight — his starlight, the
light he had made — but he could see that she was smiling.

"Marco," she said. "This is — where did you learn to do this?"

"Math," Marco said. "And the manual. And Priya and Tomás helped."

"It's not the same as before."

"No. It's what's actually out there. It's real."

Mrs. Okafor was quiet for a moment. Then she said: "The other children
were frightened. When the sky broke. They were frightened of seeing
space."

"I know."

"Are you going to tell them not to be frightened?"

"No. I'm going to show them why it's amazing."

And he did. Over the next two weeks, before the supply ship arrived
with replacement parts for the original projector, Marco ran his sky.
He programmed it to rotate slowly, matching the station's actual
position, so that the stars moved the way real stars moved — drifting
across the ceiling as the station orbited, rising and setting in a
cycle that was not Earth's cycle but the station's own. He added labels,
tiny text that appeared next to the brightest stars when you looked at
them long enough: names and distances and temperatures and ages, the
vital statistics of suns that were too far away to touch but not too
far away to know.

He ran a special program at night — station night, when the deck
lights dimmed — that showed the deep field: the most distant objects
the telescopes had ever photographed, galaxies billions of light-years
away, each one a smear of light containing hundreds of billions of
stars. The scale was impossible. The beauty was undeniable.

The kids came around first. Kids always did. They lay on the deck and
looked up and asked questions — What's that red one? How far away is
that? Could we ever go there? — and Marco answered as best he could,
and when he couldn't answer he said "I don't know, let's find out,"
which Mrs. Okafor later told him was the best thing a teacher could say.

The adults took longer. Some of them never came around. Some of them
kept their tarps and their improvised blue lights and refused to look
up. Marco didn't blame them. The truth was big and cold and it didn't
care about you, and some people needed a ceiling between themselves and
that fact.

But most of them looked. Most of them, eventually, tilted their heads
back and saw the stars — the real stars, the true stars, the stars that
had been there all along, on the other side of the lie — and most of
them found something there that they hadn't expected to find.

Not comfort. Not safety. Not the warm, false reassurance of a blue
sky and a painted sun.

Wonder.

                               * * *

The supply ship arrived on schedule. The replacement parts were
installed. Mr. Petrov, working with his engineering team, had the
original Sky Projector running again in two days.

The blue sky came back. The clouds drifted. The fake sun rose and set.
The illusion resumed.

But something had changed. Marco could feel it, even though he couldn't
quite name it. People still looked up at the blue sky and the clouds,
but they looked at them differently now. They looked at them the way you
look at a painting after you've seen the landscape it was painted from —
with appreciation, but also with the knowledge that the painting is not
the thing itself, and that the thing itself is out there, vast and real
and waiting.

Mr. Petrov called Marco to his workshop on the day the old projector
came back online.

"The station commander wants to add a feature to the Sky Projector,"
he said. "A toggle. A switch that lets people choose between the old
sky and your sky. Blue sky or real sky. Illusion or truth."

Marco blinked. "Really?"

"Really. The commander said — and I'm quoting — 'The boy was right.
People should have the choice.'"

"Can I keep working on it? The real sky program? Making it better?"

Mr. Petrov looked at him for a long moment. Then he reached into a
drawer and pulled out a key — an actual physical key, brass, old-
fashioned, the kind that opened a lock.

"Workshop key," he said. "Don't lose it. Don't come in during school
hours. Don't break anything I can't fix."

Marco took the key. It was warm from the drawer and heavy in his hand.

"Mr. Petrov?"

"Yes?"

"Thank you."

Mr. Petrov waved a hand, already turning back to his workbench.
"Don't thank me. Thank the math."

Marco put the key in his pocket and walked home. Above him, the blue
sky glowed — fake and familiar and beautiful in its way. But tonight,
he knew, someone would flip the switch, and the blue would fade, and
the real sky would appear — his sky, the sky he had built — and the
stars would shine in their true colors, and the nebulae would glow,
and the galaxy would arch across the ceiling like a bridge made of
light.

And somewhere, a kid who had been afraid would look up, and see the
truth, and find that the truth was not something to be afraid of.

The truth was something to build.

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

GUNNAR ERIKSSON was born in Uppsala, Sweden, in 1920 and emigrated to
the United States in 1946 following three years of service in the
Swedish merchant marine. He holds a degree in literature from Uppsala
University and has worked as a translator, a librarian, and a
correspondent for the Swedish-American press. His fiction, which draws
on his experiences at sea and his deep reading in Scandinavian
literature, has appeared in Astounding Science Fiction, Galaxy, and The
Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. His first collection, The
Distances Between, was published by Gnome Press in 1952 and was
described by one reviewer as "what might result if Knut Hamsun had
written science fiction — austere, luminous, and profoundly humane."
He lives in Duluth, Minnesota, with his wife Elsa and their cat,
whom he has named, with characteristic understatement, "The Void."
"The Cradle and the Void" is his second story for this magazine.

LUCIAN MARSH is the pseudonym of an English writer who has requested
that his real name not be published. We can say that he was born in
the West Country, that he was educated at Oxford, and that he has
published, under his own name, several well-regarded works of fiction
in the tradition of M.R. James and Arthur Machen. "Every Mouth a Rictus"
is his first publication in an American magazine and his first work of
science fiction, though he has expressed some doubt about the latter
designation, noting that "the monster in this story is merely wearing
a different mask than the ones I usually employ." He is said to live in
a coastal village that he declines to name, in a house that overlooks
the sea, in the company of a large number of books and a small number
of people. We are pleased and somewhat unnerved to welcome him to our
pages.

REX DRUMMOND was born Reginald Arthur Drummond in Fort Worth, Texas, in
1918, and has been writing action and adventure fiction since the age of
seventeen, when he sold his first story to Thrilling Wonder Stories for
the princely sum of fifteen dollars. He has published over two hundred
stories in venues ranging from Planet Stories to Astounding to The
Saturday Evening Post, as well as seven novels, the most recent of which,
Thunder on Titan (Ace Books, 1952), is required reading for anyone who
enjoys their science fiction at full throttle. A former rodeo rider,
bush pilot, and Golden Gloves boxer, Drummond brings an authentic
physicality to his fiction that cannot be faked. He lives in Tucson,
Arizona, where he writes, raises quarter horses, and maintains that the
best story he ever wrote "hasn't been written yet — but it involves a
race." We suspect "Chromium Thunder" may be the one he was waiting for.

THEODORE CAIN is a Californian writer whose fiction has appeared in
Galaxy, The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's, and this magazine. A
former newspaper reporter with a gift for clear, uncluttered prose,
Cain has published two novels: Eternal October Road (Simon &
Schuster, 1951) and The Heirs of Light (Simon & Schuster, 1953). His
work is characterized by a quiet versatility — he is equally at home
with time-travel paradoxes, alien contact stories, and, as "The Probate
of Worlds" demonstrates, courtroom drama of the most unusual kind. He
lives in Sonoma County with his wife, his vineyard, and his conviction
that "the most interesting questions in science fiction are not
scientific but legal: who owns the future, and who gets to decide?"

DR. VINCENT KOSLOV holds the position of professor of theoretical
physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, where
his research focuses on the topology of spacetime and the mathematical
foundations of general relativity. He began writing fiction in 1948,
when a colleague challenged him to explain his work "in a way that a
normal person might find interesting." His stories, which have appeared
in Astounding, Galaxy, and every issue of this magazine to date, are
distinguished by their rigorous scientific grounding and their capacity
to render the most abstract mathematics emotionally compelling. He has
published one collection, The Long Equations and Other Stories (Gnome
Press, 1953). He lives in Zurich with his wife and two daughters and
insists that "Seven Bridges" is not a roman a clef, though he declines
to specify which parts are fictional.

DANNY KOWALSKI is nineteen years old. He was born and raised in
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he attended public school and spent his
summers working in his uncle's auto body shop. He sold his first story,
"Rockets in the Backyard," to this magazine at the age of seventeen
(Issue #3, March 1953), and has since published a second story in
Astounding. His work is notable for its vivid, unsentimental portrayal
of young people and its infectious sense of wonder. He is currently
enrolled at Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he is studying
engineering and, one suspects, gathering material. "The Boy Who Built
the Sky" is his third published story. We predict many more.

                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have now read all four issues of your magazine, and I write to you as
a confirmed subscriber and an evangelist for your publication. However,
I must take issue with Dr. Koslov's story in Issue #3, "The Meridian
Parallax." While I have the greatest respect for Dr. Koslov's knowledge
of physics, his description of the parallax measurement of Proxima
Centauri contains an error: the baseline he specifies (1.2 AU) would
yield a parallax angle of approximately 0.65 arcseconds, not the 0.77
arcseconds stated in the text. I realize this is a small point, but as
a professional astronomer, I feel obligated to note it. Otherwise, a
splendid story.

                              — Dr. Howard Fitch
                                 Lowell Observatory, Flagstaff, Arizona

Dr. Fitch is, of course, correct. Dr. Koslov has asked us to convey his
thanks and his mild embarrassment.                                — M.S.

Dear Editor,

"The Iron Garden" by Margaret Thornton in your April issue was the most
beautiful piece of science fiction I have read in years. Her description
of the crystalline forests of Vashti IV brought tears to my eyes. I have
never encountered a writer who renders alien landscapes with such
tenderness and scientific rigor. More Thornton, please, and soon! I would
read an entire novel set on Vashti.

                              — Mrs. Eleanor Hadley
                                 Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania

We share your enthusiasm, Mrs. Hadley, and are pleased to report that
Miss Thornton is at work on a longer piece set in the Vashti system. We
hope to publish it later this year.                                — M.S.

Dear Max,

I am writing to express my extreme displeasure with the ending of Rex
Drummond's "Blood Canyon" in Issue #4. Drummond sets up a perfectly
good adventure and then resolves it with a coincidence that would make
Dickens blush. The hero just happens to have a spare fuel cell? The
villain just happens to be standing on a weak point in the canyon floor?
I have been reading Drummond since his Planet Stories days and I expect
better from him. That said, the chase sequence through the canyon was
magnificent. I forgive him. Mostly.

                              — Frank J. Palermo
                                 Brooklyn, New York

Mr. Drummond responds: "Tell Palermo I'll try to make the coincidences
more plausible next time. Or maybe I'll just make the chase sequences
so good he won't notice."                                         — M.S.

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am a twelve-year-old boy from Wichita, Kansas. I want to be a
scientist when I grow up, and your magazine is my favorite thing in the
world. I save my allowance to buy it every month. My favorite author is
Danny Kowalski because he writes about kids who actually seem like real
kids. "Rockets in the Backyard" was the best story I ever read. Can you
tell Mr. Kowalski that I built a model rocket based on the one in his
story and it actually flew? Well, sort of. It went sideways and hit the
garage. But it flew!

                              — Billy Andersen
                                 Wichita, Kansas

Billy, Mr. Kowalski says: "Tell him congratulations and tell him sideways
counts. My first rocket went sideways too. Also, tell him to keep
building." We endorse this advice.                                — M.S.

Dear Sterling,

Gunnar Eriksson's "The Last Light of Aldebaran" in Issue #3 is a
masterwork. I have read it four times and I am not finished with it.
The scene in which Commander Henriksson watches the star die through
the observation port — alone, in silence, having sent his crew to the
evacuation pods — is the most moving passage I have encountered in any
fiction, science or otherwise, this year. Eriksson writes about the
vastness of space the way only someone who has truly felt small can
write. Please give us more. Much more.

                              — Prof. James Whitfield
                                 Department of English
                                 Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.

We are delighted to comply. Mr. Eriksson's "The Cradle and the Void,"
which leads this issue, is, we believe, his finest work to date.  — M.S.

We welcome your letters! Write to: Letters, Tales from the Future and
Beyond, Meridian Publishing Company, 114 East 32nd Street, New York 16,

                         Book Reviews

================================================================================

MORE THAN HUMAN by Theodore Sturgeon
(Farrar, Straus and Young, 1953, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Sturgeon has long been one of the most gifted and least predictable
writers in our field, and with this novel he has produced what may be his
masterpiece. More Than Human tells the story of a group of misfit
individuals — a simpleton, a pair of telekinetic twins, a teleporting
girl, a mongoloid infant of staggering intellect — who discover that
they are components of a collective organism, a "homo gestalt" that is
to humanity what humanity is to the apes. The writing is lyrical,
unconventional, and frequently stunning, with passages that read like
prose poetry and a narrative structure that defies easy summary. It is
not, perhaps, a comfortable novel. Mr. Sturgeon is more interested in
the dark corners of human connection than in the well-lit corridors of
traditional science fiction. But it is a profound one, and I suspect it
will be read and discussed long after many more conventional novels have
been forgotten. Highest recommendation.

FAHRENHEIT 451 by Ray Bradbury
(Ballantine Books, 1953, $2.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Bradbury has written a book that burns, appropriately enough, with
a fierce and particular fire. In a future America where firemen do not
put out fires but start them — their job being to burn books, which have
been banned — one fireman, Guy Montag, begins to read the objects he has
been paid to destroy, and discovers that a world without books is a world
without thought, without memory, without the capacity for self-knowledge.
The novel is short, intense, and angry in the way that only a true
bibliophile can be angry. Its imagery is vivid and its message is clear,
perhaps too clear for some tastes — Mr. Bradbury is not a writer who
trusts the reader to reach the correct conclusion unaided. But the power
of the central image — a civilization that destroys its own memory — is
undeniable, and Mr. Bradbury's passionate defense of the life of the
mind is both timely and timeless. Highly recommended.

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1953, $2.50)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement has accomplished something remarkable with this novel: he
has made the physics the hero. Set on the planet Mesklin, a massive,
rapidly rotating world where gravity varies from three times Earth's at
the equator to nearly seven hundred times at the poles, the novel
follows Barlennan, a sea-captain of the centipede-like native species,
as he undertakes a perilous journey to retrieve a crashed human probe.
The world-building is extraordinary — Mesklin is perhaps the most fully
realized alien environment in science fiction — and Mr. Clement's
commitment to scientific accuracy is absolute. Every detail of Mesklin's
geography, meteorology, and biology follows logically from its physical
parameters. If the human characters are somewhat flat and the prose is
more functional than lyrical, these are small criticisms of a novel
that demonstrates, with triumphant clarity, that rigorous science and
gripping adventure are not merely compatible but complementary.
Recommended with enthusiasm.
