TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Diana Foxworth

Dear Reader,

I will dispense with pleasantries. Something is happening in these pages that requires plain speaking, and I intend to speak plainly.

Over the past several months, a portion of our readership has written to express displeasure with the direction this magazine has taken. The complaints are varied in their specifics but uniform in their sentiment: the stories we publish have become, in the words of one correspondent, "uncomfortable." Another writes that we have "abandoned the spirit of wonder" in favor of "morbid preoccupations." A third accuses us of publishing material that is "not really science fiction at all."

I have read every one of these letters. I have considered them carefully. And I must tell you, with all the respect I owe to readers who care enough to write: I disagree.

Let me tell you what I believe science fiction is for.

Science fiction is not a refuge. It is not a comfortable chair in which to sit and be reassured that the future will resemble the past, only shinier. It is not a machine for producing pleasant sensations of wonder while leaving every assumption intact. It is not, God help us, a literature of reassurance.

Science fiction is a laboratory. It is the one genre that is structurally, inherently, definitionally equipped to ask the hardest questions about what it means to be human — because it is the one genre that can change the parameters. Want to know whether love is a biochemical accident or a genuine transcendence? Build a world where love can be manufactured and see what happens. Want to know whether civilization requires permanence? Burn everything down every fifty years and watch people rebuild. Want to know whether happiness is authentic when it comes from a fruit? Eat the fruit. Write the story. Find out.

Every story in this issue will make someone uncomfortable. That is not an accident. It is the point.

Miriam Blackwell asks what happens to the self when the body becomes infinitely mutable — when you can walk through your own past as a spatial dimension. Oscar Lennox asks what knowledge is worth, and who gets to decide, and what we lose when we let fear make that decision for us. Theodore Cain holds up a mirror to a society that has organized itself around consumption and asks whether anyone in it is actually happy, or whether they have merely agreed to stop asking. Elaine Prescott asks whether love that originates in a circuit board is less real than love that originates in a gland — and if you think you know the answer, I suggest you read her story before you commit to it. Agnes Whitfield builds a civilization that accepts its own impermanence, and in doing so, she challenges an assumption so deep that most of us have never even noticed we hold it. And Rex Drummond — our own magnificent Rex, whom no one has ever accused of being uncomfortable — gives us two men whose decades-long rivalry turns out to be about something far more interesting than who flies a ship better.

These are science fiction stories. They could not exist in any other genre. They use the tools unique to this literature — extrapolation, defamiliarization, the thought experiment made flesh — to go somewhere that realistic fiction cannot go. And some of them will unsettle you. Good.

I did not become co-editor of this magazine to publish stories that leave the reader exactly as they were before reading. Max Sterling and I share a conviction that has guided every editorial decision we have made since 1964: the purpose of a story is transformation. A great story should change the reader. It should leave a mark. It should be, in some small but permanent way, an alteration of consciousness.

If that sounds grandiose, so be it. I have spent my career in a genre that imagines the transformation of worlds. I do not think it is too much to ask that our stories also transform the people who read them.

To those readers who find our current direction discomfiting, I say: stay with us. The discomfort is not a flaw in the experience. It is the experience. It is the feeling of an assumption being examined, a boundary being tested, a mind being invited to expand. You may disagree with a story's premises. You may find its conclusions troubling. You may set down the magazine and feel unsettled in a way you cannot quite articulate. All of this means the story is working.

And to those readers who have written in support of what we are doing — and there are many of you, more than you might guess — thank you. Your letters sustain us. Keep reading. Keep writing to us. Keep demanding that this genre live up to its extraordinary potential.

The six stories in this issue represent, I believe, some of the finest work this magazine has ever published. They are challenging. They are various. They are uncompromising. They are science fiction at its best — which is to say, science fiction that does the one thing no other literature can do.

It shows us what we might become.

Yours in the future,

Diana Foxworth

                         THE FLESH ARTISAN

                        by Miriam Blackwell

================================================================================

                               I.

The woman on the table had asked for gills, but what she really wanted was
permission.

Sera Voss understood this — understood it the way she understood all her
clients, which was too well, which was the problem, which was why she stood
at her sculpting console at 3:17 in the morning running her fingers over
holographic cross-sections of pulmonary tissue while the rest of the studio
slept in its dim amber standby glow. The woman — Danielle, age
thirty-four, former marine biologist, now unemployed since the oceans had
been farmed out to the kelp consortiums — wanted to breathe water. Wanted
to descend into the deep Pacific and feel the crush and hush of a world
that no longer belonged to anyone and move through it as a native, as a
resident, as something that belonged.

But what she actually wanted, Sera knew, was to stop being what she was.

Sera closed the pulmonary display and opened instead the client's
psychological profile — a cascade of metrics, affect maps, identity graphs
that bloomed in the air like luminous flowers. She studied them the way her
mother had studied faces, which was to say, with an attention so complete
it bordered on intrusion. Danielle's profile showed the characteristic
signature of what Sera privately called the chrysalis clients: people who
came to the Atelier not for augmentation or repair or even aesthetic
refinement but for metamorphosis. They wanted to stop being human. Or
rather — and this was the distinction that mattered, the one that
separated Sera's work from the chop-shops and body-mills that operated in
the lower districts — they wanted to discover what human could mean if you
removed the constraints that evolution had imposed.

She pulled up her own design notes. The gills were elegant — a modified
branchial system integrated with the existing respiratory architecture, gas
exchange surfaces woven through the intercostal spaces, water intake
channels along the lateral ribcage that would open and close with the same
unconscious rhythm as breathing. Sera had spent four months on the design.
It was, by any technical standard, superb.

But it wasn't enough.

She rotated the holographic model, studying the way the gill structures
interfaced with the thoracic cavity. The problem wasn't mechanical. The
problem was experiential. A human with gills would breathe water, yes —
but she would still experience breathing water as a human. Her
proprioceptive map, her sensory integration, her fundamental sense of
bodily self would remain organized around the template of a terrestrial
mammal. She would be a human who could breathe water. Not a water-being
who remembered being human.

The difference was everything.

Sera sat down on the sculpting stool and pulled her dark hair back from
her face. The studio surrounded her — a vast, clean space on the
forty-third floor of the Atelier, filled with sculpting consoles,
bio-fabrication chambers, and the faint, sweet smell of growth medium. The
walls were transparent, and through them she could see the nighttime
skyline of New Valencia: towers of light and glass, sky-bridges strung
between them like luminous threads, and above it all the slow drift of
atmospheric processors trailing their banners of engineered cloud.

She had been doing this work for eleven years. In that time she had
sculpted over three hundred bodies — some beautiful, some strange, some
barely recognizable as having originated from human templates. She had
given a dancer extra joints in her spine. She had given a musician ears
that could perceive ultrasonic frequencies. She had given a man a second
pair of arms, and then a third, and he had come back a year later weeping
with gratitude because for the first time in his life his body matched the
image he had always carried inside himself.

But all of these — even the most radical, even the six-armed man — had
been variations on a theme. Extensions and modifications of the human
template. The body altered but the experience of embodiment unchanged. You
were still a human looking out through human eyes at a human world, even
if the eyes were compound and the world was one you had chosen.

Sera wanted to go further. She had always wanted to go further. The
question that had drawn her to body-sculpting in the first place — the
question she asked herself every morning when she entered the studio and
every night when she left it, the question that kept her awake at 3:17 in
the morning when she should have been sleeping — was not how to change
the human body but how to change the human experience of having a body.

Not what we are. What we perceive ourselves to be.

She turned back to the console and began a new design.

                               * * *

The Atelier occupied the top twelve floors of the Chrysalis Tower in
downtown New Valencia, and it was, by any measure, the most prestigious
body-sculpting studio in the Western Hemisphere. Its founder, Dr. Anton
Meersand, had pioneered the cellular reprogramming techniques that made
true body sculpture possible — not mere cosmetic alteration or prosthetic
augmentation, but the literal reshaping of living tissue according to a
client's specifications. Under Meersand's direction, the Atelier had
become the place where the wealthy and the desperate and the visionary
came to become what they wished to be.

Meersand was seventy-three now, semi-retired, and the Atelier's reputation
rested largely on Sera's shoulders. She was the best sculptor in the
studio, possibly in the world. Her peers acknowledged this with the
complicated mixture of admiration and resentment that excellence always
provokes. She was known for two things: the technical precision of her
work and the unsettling depth of her consultations. Other sculptors asked
their clients what they wanted. Sera asked them what they were, and then
what they wanted to stop being, and then what they were afraid they might
become. The consultations lasted hours. Some clients wept. Some left
and did not return. The ones who stayed became her most devoted
advocates — people who spoke of Sera Voss not as a technician but as a
species of therapist or priest or artist who had seen them more clearly
than they had ever seen themselves.

She was a small woman, dark-haired, dark-eyed, with the quiet intensity
of someone who spends most of her time listening. She lived alone in a
small apartment below the studio and had no relationships she considered
significant, a fact she reported without self-pity. "I spend all day
inside other people's bodies," she told a reporter who asked about her
personal life. "By evening I don't have anything left for another person."

This was not entirely true. What was true was that Sera's relationships
had always foundered on the same asymmetry: she understood other people
too well, and they understood her not at all. She could look at a person
and see the architecture of their self-image — the load-bearing walls, the
concealed rooms, the structural compromises — and this vision, useful in
the studio, was devastating in intimacy. You cannot love someone who sees
through you. Or rather, you can love them, but you cannot be comfortable,
and most people preferred comfort.

                               II.

The new design took six months.

Sera worked on it between client appointments, in the early mornings and
the late nights, building it layer by layer in the holographic workspace
of her private console. She did not tell Meersand. She did not tell
anyone. The design was radical enough that she knew it would generate
opposition — from the medical ethics board, from the cultural
conservatives who already considered body-sculpting an abomination, from
the quiet, powerful people who believed that the human form was sacred and
that any departure from it was a kind of apostasy.

The design was this: a body that perceived time as a spatial dimension.

She had been thinking about it for years — ever since a conversation with
a theoretical physicist at a dinner party, a slightly drunk man named Haas
who had leaned across the table and said, "You know, there's nothing in
the physics that says time has to be experienced sequentially. It's just
a dimension. The equations don't care which direction you move through it.
The reason we experience it as a one-way flow is biological — it's a
constraint imposed by the structure of human cognition, not by the
structure of the universe."

Sera had gone home that night and begun reading: physics, neuroscience,
the phenomenology of time perception. She discovered that Haas was right.
The experience of time as a one-way flow from past to future was a product
of neural architecture — specifically, the way the hippocampus encoded
memory and the prefrontal cortex constructed anticipation. Change the
architecture, and you could change the experience. Not time travel — the
body would still exist in conventional spacetime — but a radical
alteration of temporal perception that would allow a person to experience
their own past not as memory but as place. To stand, perceptually, in a
moment that had already happened, and look around, and feel it not as
recollection but as presence.

Walking through your own past.

The technical challenges were formidable. She had to redesign the
hippocampal formation entirely — restructure the way memory was encoded so
that temporal information was stored spatially, with the same richness
and dimensionality that the brain normally reserved for location. She had
to alter the thalamic relay systems to create a new perceptual channel —
one that would present temporal data the way the visual cortex presented
light, as a field of information arrayed around the body, navigable,
explorable, real. She had to modify the vestibular system so that
movement through time would feel like movement through space — with the
same proprioceptive feedback, the same sense of balance and orientation,
the same fundamental conviction that you were going somewhere.

And she had to do all of this without destroying the subject's ability to
function in conventional time. The person would need to be able to switch
between modes of temporal perception — to live in the ordinary sequential
flow when necessary, and to step outside it, into the spatial experience
of time, when they chose. A toggle. A second way of being in the world.

She built it in the holographic workspace, neuron by neuron. She tested
it in simulation, running thousands of virtual neural architectures
through accelerated cognitive cycles, watching for instabilities,
cascading failures, perceptual paradoxes that might shatter a mind that
tried to contain them. She failed hundreds of times. She went back and
rebuilt. She failed again. She rebuilt again.

After six months, the design was stable. In simulation, it worked. The
virtual minds she tested could perceive time spatially — could navigate
their own pasts as landscapes, could stand in a moment that had already
happened and experience it with the full sensory richness of the present.
They reported the experience as disorienting, overwhelming, beautiful, and
fundamentally unlike anything they had words for. Several of the virtual
subjects developed new metaphors to describe it. One said it was like
"living inside a cathedral made of clocks." Another said it was like
"reading a book where every page is also a room you can walk into."

Sera saved the design, encrypted it, and locked it in her personal
archive. Then she sat in the dark studio and wondered who on Earth she
could build it for.

                               III.

His name was Aron Kael, and he came to the Atelier in November, when
the first winter storms were lashing New Valencia's towers and the
atmospheric processors were struggling to keep the engineered climate
within tolerances.

He was fifty-six years old, thin, with the kind of face that looked like
it had been lived in — lined and weathered and marked with the particular
exhaustion of someone who has been paying close attention for too long. He
sat in the consultation chair across from Sera and said, without
preamble: "I want to remember."

Sera waited. In consultations, the first statement was never the real one.

"I'm a historian," he said. "Was. I spent thirty years documenting
the oral histories of displaced communities — refugees, exiles, people
driven from their homes by the climate shifts. I recorded their stories.
Thousands of them. I have them all archived — perfect recordings, every
word, every inflection, every pause." He looked at his hands. "But I
don't remember them. Not the way they deserve to be remembered. I
remember the data. I don't remember the experience. I don't remember what
it felt like to sit in a camp in the flooded lowlands and listen to an old
woman describe the village she grew up in, the one that's under sixty feet
of water now. I have the recording. I don't have the presence."

Sera studied him. His affect profile — she was reading it on her console,
a cascade of micro-expression analysis, vocal stress patterns, autonomic
indicators — showed genuine distress layered over something deeper:
guilt. He felt that he had failed the people whose stories he had
collected. Not by recording them inadequately but by experiencing them
inadequately. He had been a container when he should have been a witness.

"You want to go back," she said.

"I want to be there," he said. "Not to watch a recording. To be there.
In the moment. In the room with them. Feeling what I should have felt the
first time, when I was too busy being a professional to feel anything."

Sera leaned back in her chair. Her heart was beating faster than it should
have been. She recognized the feeling — the particular excitement of a
sculptor who has found the subject that will make the work meaningful, the
body that will give the design a soul.

"I have something," she said. "It's untested in living tissue. It's
radical. It will change the way you experience reality in ways that
neither of us can fully predict."

"Tell me," Aron said.

She told him. She explained the design — the restructured hippocampus, the
new thalamic relay channels, the spatial encoding of temporal information.
She told him what the simulations had shown: the ability to perceive one's
own past as a navigable space, to stand in a moment that had already
happened and experience it with the full richness of the present. She told
him the risks: perceptual disorientation, possible psychotic breaks if the
mind could not integrate the dual modes of temporal experience, the
unknown long-term effects of living with a fundamentally altered
relationship to time.

Aron listened with his entire body — leaning forward, his eyes fixed on
hers, his breathing shallow. When she finished, he was silent for a long
time.

"You're describing something that isn't human," he said at last.

"No," Sera said. "I'm describing something that's human in a way we
haven't been yet."

He closed his eyes. She watched the micro-expressions play across his
face — fear, excitement, grief, hope — and beneath them all the deep,
structural weight of a man who had spent his life trying to hold onto
things that slipped away.

"Yes," he said. "Build it."

                               IV.

The sculpting took four months.

Sera performed the work in the Atelier's deepest studio — a sealed,
climate-controlled chamber twenty floors below street level, where the
most delicate and radical procedures were done. Aron lay in a sculpting
cradle, his body suspended in a nutrient bath that kept his tissues viable
while Sera's instruments worked. He was conscious throughout — the neural
modifications required consciousness, required the brain to be active and
responsive so that Sera could calibrate the new structures against the
living patterns of his cognition.

She worked with a precision that surprised even herself. Each neural
pathway was laid down individually — not stamped from a template but
grown, guided, coaxed into position with the delicacy of a jeweler
setting stones. The hippocampal restructuring was the most complex element:
she had to remap the memory-encoding systems without destroying the
existing memories, laying new spatial-temporal channels alongside the old
sequential ones so that the same memory could be accessed in two
fundamentally different ways.

It was, she thought, like building a second city on top of the first.
Same streets, same buildings, same people — but experienced from a
different altitude, a different angle, a different relationship to gravity.

Aron reported the changes as they occurred. The first week, he noticed
nothing. The second week, he began to experience what he described as
"echoes" — moments when a current sensation would trigger not a memory
but a sense of place, as though the past event were happening in an
adjacent room that he could almost see into. "It's like hearing music
through a wall," he said. "I know something is there. I can feel its
shape. But I can't quite get to it."

The third week, the echoes became corridors.

"I was lying here," he told Sera, his voice strange and careful, "and I
was thinking about the first interview I ever conducted — a man named
Torres, in a camp outside Veracruz, twenty-eight years ago. And then I
wasn't remembering it. I was — adjacent to it. It was here. Not in my
head. Here. Around me. I could feel the heat of the camp. I could smell
the cook-fires. I could hear Torres's voice — not as a recording, not as
a memory, but as a sound in the space around me. And I could — this is
the part I don't have words for — I could feel my position relative to
it. I knew where in the moment I was standing. I could have stepped
forward. Into it. Through it."

"Did you?" Sera asked.

"No. I was afraid."

She nodded. "That will pass."

                               * * *

By the fourth month, it didn't pass. It deepened.

Aron stopped reporting the experiences verbally and began drawing them —
crude, frantic sketches on whatever surface was available, diagrams that
looked like maps of impossible buildings, floor plans of structures that
existed in directions the paper didn't have. Sera studied the drawings
with a growing sense that the design was working but that her simulations
had not adequately predicted what it would feel like from the inside.

"You're drawing architecture," she said.

"It is architecture," Aron said. "That's what it feels like. My past is
a building. A vast building. Rooms and corridors and stairways, and every
room is a moment, and every corridor is a transition between moments, and
I can walk through it. I can stand in the doorway of a room and look in
and see — not remember, see — what happened there. The light. The faces.
The texture of the air. It's all there. It was always there. I just
couldn't navigate to it before."

"How does it feel?"

He set down the pencil and looked at her with an expression she had never
seen on a client's face — an expression she did not, in that moment, have
a name for, though she would later come to think of it as the look of a
person who has discovered a new sense and is still learning what it is
for.

"It feels," he said, "like I have been blind my entire life and now I can
see in a direction I didn't know existed."

                               V.

The procedure was completed on a Tuesday in March, and Aron Kael walked
out of the Atelier into a world that no other human being had ever
experienced.

He called Sera every day for the first two weeks. She recorded the calls.
They constitute, as far as she knows, the only first-person account of
spatial temporal perception ever produced by a living human mind.

The first call: "I'm sitting in my apartment and I can see my past. Not
behind me — not in any direction that maps onto physical space. In another
direction. A direction that doesn't have a name. I'm going to call it
inward, but that's not right either. It's — perpendicular. Perpendicular
to everything. My past is perpendicular to my present, and it extends away
from me like a hallway, and every door in the hallway is open."

The third call: "I went to the waterfront today. I've been there hundreds
of times. But today I stood at the railing and I could see — could
navigate to — every other time I had stood at that railing. They were all
there. Layered. I could step into any one of them. I stepped into a day
from seven years ago — a warm day, I was eating an orange, there was a
woman playing guitar near the pier. And I was there. Not remembering it.
There. I could feel the warmth on my skin. I could taste the orange. I
could hear the guitar. It was happening. It was present. And at the same
time I could feel the March wind on my face in the now, and I could feel
the warmth of seven years ago on my skin in the then, and both were real,
both were present, and I was in both places, in both times, and I was not
confused by this. It felt natural. It felt like the way things are
supposed to be."

The fifth call: "I went to see Torres."

Sera's breath caught. "The man from Veracruz? From the camp?"

"Yes. I navigated to the interview. Twenty-eight years ago. The camp
outside Veracruz. I was there. I was sitting across from him in the tent,
and I could see his face, and he was telling me about his village — the
village that flooded — and this time I felt it. This time I was present.
I wasn't recording. I wasn't documenting. I was there, and he was telling
me about his home, and I could feel the weight of what he was carrying.
The grief. The loss. The — the dignity of it. The way he sat up straight
and spoke clearly even though he was describing the end of everything he
knew."

He was crying. Sera could hear it in the pauses, in the ragged edges of
his breathing.

"I owed him that," Aron said. "I owed all of them that. To be there. To
actually be there. And now I can. I can go back and give them what I should
have given them the first time. My presence. My attention. My — my grief,
which should have been their grief, which I should have let myself feel
instead of hiding behind the recording equipment."

Sera did not speak. She had designed the body but she had not fully
predicted the soul that would inhabit it. She sat in her studio and
listened to a man weep his way through a new form of consciousness, and
she understood — as she had always understood, but never quite so clearly
— that the body was not a machine. It was an instrument. And the music it
played depended entirely on who was playing it.

                               VI.

The seventh call was different.

"Something has changed," Aron said. His voice was calm but strange — the
calm of someone who has moved beyond fear into a state that does not have
a name.

"Tell me."

"I've been navigating further. Deeper into my past. Earlier memories.
Childhood. And I've discovered that the — I'm going to call it the
architecture — changes the further back you go. The rooms are different.
The corridors are wider. The light is different. It's as though the
building of my past wasn't all built at the same time. The older parts
are — rougher. More organic. The walls are less defined. The boundaries
between rooms blur. Moments bleed into each other."

"That's consistent with the way early memories are encoded," Sera said.
"Childhood memories are less precisely differentiated —"

"That's not what I called about," Aron said. "I called because I found
the end."

"The end?"

"The beginning. The earliest room. The first memory. The foundation of the
building. I don't know how old I was — very young, pre-verbal, everything
is sensation and emotion without language. A room with yellow light. A
face — my mother's face, I think, though it's not a face, not exactly,
it's a — a constellation of warmth and smell and sound that my infant mind
hadn't yet assembled into the concept of a face. And below that room —"

He stopped. Sera waited. The silence stretched.

"Below that room," he said, "there is nothing. Not darkness. Not void.
Nothing. The absence of experience. The edge of being. The place before
I existed."

"Are you all right?"

"I'm standing at the edge of my own beginning," he said. "I'm looking
at the moment before I existed. And I can feel — this is what I can't
describe — I can feel the direction. The direction of not-being. The way
you can stand at the edge of a cliff and feel the direction of down. I
can feel the direction of before-me. And it's not frightening. It's —"

Another silence.

"It's beautiful," he said. "It's the most beautiful thing I've ever
experienced. The edge of my own existence. The threshold between being
and not-being. And I'm standing on it, and I'm looking out into the place
where I wasn't yet, and I can feel the — the potential. The gathered
potential of everything I was about to become, compressed into a single
point, a single moment, the moment before the first moment. And it's —
it hums. It hums with possibility. With the sheer compressed energy of a
life that hasn't happened yet."

Sera realized she was gripping the edge of her console so hard her
knuckles were white.

"I designed a body," she said, quietly, to herself as much as to him.

"You designed a world," Aron said. "And I'm living in it. And it is
larger than either of us imagined."

                               VII.

The calls continued, but less frequently. Aron was spending more and more
time in the spatial mode — navigating his past, exploring its architecture,
returning to moments he had lived through and experiencing them with a
richness and presence that his original, sequential experience of them had
never allowed. He was, he told Sera, doing the work he had always meant to
do: bearing witness. Going back to the camps, the settlements, the
makeshift communities where he had collected stories, and being present
for them in a way he had not been the first time.

"It's not changing anything," he said. "The past is fixed. The rooms are
what they are. But my experience of them changes. What I bring to them
changes. And that — that turns out to matter. Not to the past, but to me.
To who I am now. Each time I return to a moment and give it my full
attention, I come back to the present slightly different. Slightly more —
I want to say 'complete,' but that's not it. Slightly more continuous.
As though the gaps in my life are filling in. As though I'm becoming more
fully present in my own existence."

Sera listened and recorded and thought about what she had made.

She thought about the woman with the gills — Danielle — who was still
waiting for her consultation. She thought about the six-armed man and the
dancer with the extra joints and all the other bodies she had sculpted,
and she saw them differently now. She had given them new capacities, new
capabilities, new ways of interacting with the world. But she had not
given any of them a new way of being in it. She had changed what they
could do without changing what they could experience.

Aron Kael was the first.

She wondered — and this was the thought that kept her awake, that
followed her through the corridors of the Atelier and sat beside her at
her console and whispered in her ear while she worked — she wondered what
other modes of experience were possible. If time could be perceived as
space, what else? Could causation be perceived directly, the way color
was perceived — not inferred but seen, an immediate sensory apprehension
of the connection between one event and another? Could probability be
felt? Could a body be designed that experienced the quantum
superposition of states not as an abstraction but as a lived reality —
being in two places at once not as a thought experiment but as a
sensation, a bodily feeling, a mode of inhabiting the world?

The human template was a starting point, not a destination. Evolution had
given humanity one way of experiencing reality — one sensory palette, one
temporal mode, one spatial orientation, one set of perceptual categories.
But the universe contained more. Vastly more. Modes of experience that no
human had ever had, that no biological organism on Earth had ever had,
because evolution optimized for survival, not for comprehension. The bodies
that evolution built were good at staying alive. They were not designed to
understand the world they were alive in.

Sera's bodies could be.

She sat in the dark studio and let the thought unfold. She thought about
a body that could perceive electromagnetic fields directly — not through
instruments but through a sensory organ, the way the eye perceived light.
A body that could feel the curvature of spacetime, that would experience
gravity not as a force but as a landscape, a topology of the world that
was as vivid and immediate as color or sound. A body that could perceive
the passage of entropy — the slow slide from order to disorder — as a
sensory quality, the way we perceive temperature or pressure.

She thought: I am not a technician. I am not a therapist. I am not even
an artist, though that is the word that comes closest.

I am an explorer. And the territory I am exploring is the space of
possible experiences.

                               VIII.

Aron Kael came back to the Atelier once more, six months after the
procedure. He was thinner than she remembered, and his eyes had changed —
not physically, but in the way he used them. He looked at the world with
a strange double attention, as though he were seeing both what was in
front of him and what had been in front of him in every previous moment
he had occupied this space.

"I need to tell you something," he said.

They sat in the consultation room. The winter light came through the
transparent walls and made everything look clean and provisional, as
though the world were a sketch that could be revised.

"I found something else," he said. "In the architecture. Something I
wasn't looking for."

"Tell me."

"I told you that the older memories are less defined. That the rooms blur
together. That the boundaries dissolve."

"Yes."

"I've been exploring that dissolution. Going deeper into it. Letting the
boundaries dissolve further. And I've discovered that when you go deep
enough — past the earliest memories, past infancy, past the threshold of
being — the architecture doesn't end. It continues. But it stops being
mine."

Sera felt the hair rise on the back of her neck.

"The memories below the threshold — the experiences in the rooms beneath
the foundation of my own existence — they're not my memories. They're —
I don't know what they are. They're experiences. They're moments. But
they don't belong to me. They belong to — to someone. To something.
They're older than I am. Much older. And they're not human."

"What are they?"

Aron closed his eyes. When he opened them, there was something in his
face that she recognized from her earliest days as a sculptor — the look
of a client trying to describe a body that doesn't exist yet, reaching
for words that haven't been invented.

"They're the experiences of the matter I'm made of," he said. "The atoms.
The molecules. Before they were me, they were other things. They were part
of the soil, the ocean, the atmosphere. They were in other bodies —
animals, plants, organisms that lived and died millions of years before I
was born. And the experiences of those bodies — the sensations, the
moments of being — are encoded in the matter. Not in the neural
architecture. In the matter itself. And my new perceptual system can
access them."

Sera did not speak. She could not speak.

"I have stood in the body of a fish," Aron said. "In the Devonian. I
have felt the current of an ancient ocean move through gills that are not
my gills, through a body that is not my body, in a moment that happened
three hundred million years before I was born. And it was real. It was
as real as this room. It was as real as Torres in the camp in Veracruz.
It was a moment of being, and I was there, and the fish was there, and we
were the same matter arranged in different patterns, and for one instant
I was both."

He reached across the table and took her hand. His grip was gentle but
his skin was very warm.

"You didn't design a new body," he said. "You designed a new way of
being connected to everything that has ever existed. Every moment that
matter has experienced is still there. Still present. Still navigable. I
am walking through the history of the universe, Sera, and it is all one
building, and I am at home in every room."

Sera looked at their joined hands. She thought about the gills she had
designed for Danielle. She thought about all the bodies she had sculpted,
all the forms she had dreamed, and she understood — fully, completely,
with a clarity that felt like the first clear thought she had ever had —
that she had been thinking too small.

Not new bodies.

New modes of being.

She freed her hand gently from Aron's grip. She went to her console. She
opened a new design file and labeled it with the date.

And then, in the quiet of the studio, with the winter light falling
through the transparent walls and a man who had walked through three
hundred million years of existence sitting behind her, she began to
design a body that could experience everything.

She had no idea what it would feel like.

That was the point.

                      ASHES OF ALIEN KNOWLEDGE

                         by Oscar Lennox

================================================================================

                               I.

On the day the Library was condemned, Marcus Pelham was cataloguing its
seven-hundred-and-forty-third room.

He worked with the systematic patience of a man who understood that the
task was impossible and had chosen to do it anyway. The room was vast — a
curved, red-stone chamber whose walls rose in terraced shelves to a ceiling
lost in shadow, every surface covered with the thin, flexible tablets that
the Martians had used instead of paper. The tablets were made of a ceramic
compound that Earth science could not yet replicate, each one the size of
a human palm, inscribed on both sides with the flowing, branching script
that Pelham and his colleagues had spent the last six years learning to
read.

Six years. In that time, they had managed to translate approximately
eleven percent of the Library's contents — a figure that sounds modest
until you consider that the Library contained an estimated two million
tablets, organized across more than eight hundred rooms carved into the
red sandstone mesa that the first explorers had simply called the Shelf.

The Shelf rose from the floor of Hellas Planitia like a monument to
patience. From a distance, it looked like a natural formation — a long,
flat-topped ridge of sedimentary rock, unremarkable against the vast,
russet landscape of the basin. It was only when you approached within a
kilometer that you began to notice the geometry: the regular spacing of
the openings in the cliff face, the smoothed surfaces, the faint tracery
of carved script that covered every exposed surface like a stone mason's
obsessive marginalia.

The first human expedition to Mars, in 2031, had landed in Hellas
Planitia because the basin's low elevation made the thin Martian
atmosphere slightly less hostile — a few extra millibars of pressure, a
fraction more protection from radiation. They had noticed the Shelf on
their third day. By the fifth day, they had entered the first room and
found the tablets. By the seventh, they had transmitted images back to
Earth. By the tenth, the world had changed.

An extinct Martian civilization. A library. The greatest archaeological
discovery in human history.

And now, twenty-three years later, the Senate Oversight Committee on
Extraterrestrial Artifacts had voted, by a margin of eleven to six, to
destroy it.

                               * * *

Pelham learned of the vote from a radio transmission relayed through the
Deimos communications station. He was sitting cross-legged on the floor
of Room 743, surrounded by tablets, his environment suit's climate system
humming steadily against the cold. The message came through his earpiece
in the flat, professional voice of Director Haynes at Ares Base:

"Marcus, I need you to come back to base. The Committee vote came through
this morning. It's confirmed. The Library is to be demolished and the
site sterilized. Implementation timeline is ninety days."

Pelham set down the tablet he was holding — a small, slightly curved
piece covered in what he had tentatively identified as a treatise on
atmospheric chemistry — and stared at the far wall of the chamber. The
wall was covered in a mosaic of tablets arranged in a pattern that his
colleague Elena Vasiliev believed was a classification system, a kind of
Martian Dewey Decimal. They had not yet deciphered the organizational
logic.

Ninety days.

"On what grounds?" he said, though he already knew.

"The Garrity Report. Cultural destabilization risk. They're citing the
religious unrest after the translation of the Origin Texts, the economic
disruption from the Martian metallurgy papers, and the — well, you know.
The weapons-applicable material in Section Twelve."

Pelham knew. Section Twelve contained what appeared to be a comprehensive
Martian understanding of nuclear physics — not the same path that human
science had followed, but arriving at the same destinations and then
continuing far beyond them, into realms of nuclear manipulation that human
physics had not yet imagined. The translations had been classified
immediately. Three of the translators had been reassigned. One had
disappeared — "recalled to Earth" was the official language — and Pelham
had never been able to determine what had become of her.

"Marcus? Are you there?"

"I'm here."

"I need you at base by oh-eight-hundred tomorrow. There'll be a briefing.
I'm sorry."

The transmission ended. Pelham sat in the silence of Room 743 and listened
to the sound of his own breathing. The room was cold — four degrees
Celsius, the ambient temperature of the Library's interior, maintained by
some aspect of the structure's engineering that they had never fully
understood. The Martians had built the Library to last. The ceramic tablets
were impervious to weathering, radiation, and microbiological decay. The
stone chambers were carved with tolerances that would embarrass a Swiss
watchmaker. The whole structure was a monument to permanence, a
civilization's attempt to make its knowledge survive its own extinction.

And in ninety days, a species that had crossed interplanetary space was
going to blow it up because the knowledge inside it was too dangerous.

Pelham picked up the tablet he had been holding and looked at the
flowing script. He could read it now — haltingly, with many gaps, but
enough to follow the general thrust of the text. This particular tablet
was discussing the behavior of trace gases in a thin atmosphere — how
carbon dioxide and water vapor interacted at low pressures, how these
interactions affected thermal retention, how the resulting climate
patterns shaped the surface conditions of a world very much like the one
outside the chamber.

The Martians had understood their own atmosphere with extraordinary
precision. They had watched it thin and fail over millennia, and they
had documented the process with the meticulous, heartbreaking thoroughness
of people who knew they were recording their own death.

And someone on Earth had decided that this knowledge was too dangerous
to exist.

                               II.

Ares Base was a cluster of pressurized modules arranged in a rough
hexagon on the basin floor, connected by enclosed walkways and surrounded
by a perimeter of solar arrays, communication towers, and parked vehicles.
It housed sixty-eight people: scientists, engineers, support staff, and a
small contingent of United Nations security personnel whose presence had
grown steadily more conspicuous over the past two years.

Pelham arrived at 7:43 the next morning, having walked the eleven
kilometers from the Shelf in the pre-dawn darkness. He had not slept. He
had spent the night in Room 743, reading tablets by the light of his
suit lamp, reading them with a new and terrible urgency, as though he
could absorb the Library's contents through sheer desperate intensity.

The briefing was held in the base's largest module, a dome-roofed chamber
that served as mess hall, meeting room, and de facto town square. Director
Haynes stood at the front, flanked by two UN security officers and a woman
Pelham didn't recognize — thin, gray-suited, with the composed expression
of someone accustomed to delivering bad news.

"This is Dr. Catherine Whitford, from the Committee's implementation
office," Haynes said. "She'll be overseeing the demolition."

Whitford nodded to the assembled staff — thirty-two people, the entire
Library research team, sitting in rows of folding chairs with expressions
ranging from stunned to furious. "I understand this is difficult," she
said. "I want to assure you that the Committee's decision was not taken
lightly. The Garrity Report represents eighteen months of analysis by —"

"The Garrity Report is a political document," said Elena Vasiliev from
the third row. She was a small, fierce woman from St. Petersburg who had
spent four years mapping the Library's organizational structure, and her
voice was steady in the way that very angry people's voices are steady.
"It was commissioned by Senator Garrity, who has made no secret of his
belief that the Library is — what was his phrase — 'an existential threat
to human cultural coherence.' The report's conclusions were determined
before the first page was written."

"Dr. Vasiliev —"

"We have translated eleven percent of the Library's contents. Eleven
percent. Of a repository of knowledge created by a civilization that
existed for at least forty thousand years. We have barely scratched the
surface. And you are going to destroy it because some of what we found
made people uncomfortable."

"It's not a matter of comfort," Whitford said. "It's a matter of —"

"Of what? Of control?" This was James Okafor, the team's linguist, a
tall Nigerian man who had developed the primary translation protocols for
Martian script and who spoke with the measured precision of someone
choosing every word as carefully as if he were translating it. "Because
that is what the Garrity Report is about. Not safety. Not cultural
preservation. Control. The Library contains knowledge that threatens
existing power structures. The energy technology in Section Eight could
obsolete the petroleum economy overnight. The agricultural science in
Section Fifteen could feed every person on Earth. The political theory in
Section Twenty — yes, they had political theory, and it is subtle and
profound and deeply challenging to every system of governance currently
operating on Earth. This is not about protecting humanity from dangerous
knowledge. This is about protecting the powerful from inconvenient
knowledge."

Whitford's composed expression did not change. Pelham recognized the
face of a bureaucrat who had been trained to absorb outrage. "The
Committee has considered these arguments," she said. "The decision stands.
You have ninety days to conclude your work, archive your existing
translations, and prepare for the demolition."

"Archive our translations," Vasiliev said. "And how long before those
are classified too? How long before the translations join the tablets in
the bonfire?"

Whitford did not answer.

The meeting ended. People filed out in small groups, speaking in low,
urgent voices. Pelham remained in his chair, staring at the floor. Haynes
approached him and sat down.

"You're thinking about doing something stupid," Haynes said.

"I'm thinking about the Library of Alexandria," Pelham said. "I'm
thinking about the Bamiyan Buddhas. I'm thinking about every book the
Inquisition burned and every manuscript the Mongols threw in the Tigris
and every piece of knowledge that was destroyed because someone decided
it was too dangerous, too heretical, too foreign, too threatening to the
existing order."

"Marcus —"

"They burned the Maya codices. Did you know that? The Spanish priests
burned virtually every written record of Maya civilization because the
knowledge they contained was incompatible with Christian doctrine. We lost
— we cannot even calculate what we lost. An entire civilization's
understanding of mathematics, astronomy, history, medicine. Gone. Because
a priest was afraid of what the books might say."

"I know the history."

"Then you understand that this is the same thing. It is exactly the same
thing. A civilization's entire body of knowledge — forty thousand years of
science, philosophy, art, medicine, history — and we are going to destroy
it because we are afraid."

Haynes was silent for a moment. "What are you going to do?"

"I don't know yet," Pelham said. "Something stupid, probably."

                               III.

The plan came together over the next three weeks, not as a single
inspiration but as an accretion of small, desperate decisions made by
people who had devoted their lives to the Library and could not bear to
watch it die.

There were nine of them. Pelham, Vasiliev, Okafor, and six others —
researchers, technicians, one security officer who had been quietly
sympathetic from the beginning. They met in the Library itself, in the
deep rooms where the surveillance systems had never been installed because
the Committee had not considered it necessary to monitor the movements of
scholars among bookshelves.

The plan was simple in conception and terrifying in execution. They could
not save the Library. The demolition charges would reduce the Shelf to
rubble, and there was no force on Mars that could prevent it. But they
could copy as much as possible. They could photograph tablets, transcribe
translations, record everything they could reach in the time they had
left. And then they could hide the copies — in personal data archives,
in encrypted files embedded in routine scientific transmissions back to
Earth, in the memories of the people who had read and understood the texts.

"We can't copy two million tablets in ninety days," Vasiliev said. "Even
with all of us working around the clock."

"No," Pelham agreed. "We have to choose. We have to decide what to save."

The silence that followed was the worst moment of Pelham's life. He had
spent six years cataloguing the Library, six years mapping its rooms and
organizing its contents and building a tentative understanding of the
Martian civilization's intellectual structure. He knew what was in each
section. He knew which rooms contained the atmospheric science, which
contained the mathematics, which contained what appeared to be fiction or
poetry — long, lyrical tablets whose script had a different rhythm than
the scientific texts, and which Elena believed were narratives, stories,
the Martians' attempt to preserve not just their knowledge but their
experience of being alive.

He knew what was in each room. And now he had to decide which rooms to
let die.

"The science," Okafor said. "The energy technology, the agricultural
systems, the medical knowledge. The things that could help people."

"The language itself," Vasiliev said. "If we save enough of the
linguistic data, future scholars can translate anything else that survives.
The key to the Library is the language."

"The histories," said Anna Chen, a junior researcher who specialized in
the chronological texts. "They recorded forty thousand years. That's a
continuous record of a civilization from its earliest emergence to its
extinction. We have nothing like it on Earth. Nothing."

"The poetry," Pelham said quietly. Everyone looked at him. "The poetry
and the stories. The things they wrote that weren't about knowledge but
about experience. About what it felt like to be a Martian — to look up
at a thinning sky and know your world was dying and to write about it
anyway, to make something beautiful in the face of extinction. If we lose
everything else and save that, we save the thing that matters most. We
save who they were."

There was no consensus. There could not be consensus. They argued for
three hours in the cold, silent chamber, their breath fogging in the thin
air of the Library, their voices echoing off the ceramic tablets that
lined the walls. In the end, they divided the work: each person would
focus on the section they knew best, would copy and translate and preserve
as much as they could carry. They would not try to coordinate. They would
not try to be comprehensive. They would save what they could save and
trust that the fragments, when assembled, would constitute something worth
having.

"It won't be enough," Vasiliev said.

"No," Pelham said. "It won't."

                               IV.

The next seventy days were a blur of exhaustion and grief and fierce,
concentrated work.

Pelham worked sixteen hours a day in the Library, moving from room to
room with a portable imaging system that could photograph a tablet in
four seconds. He photographed everything he could reach — moving
systematically through the rooms he knew best, the atmospheric science
section and the astronomical records and the long, beautiful chamber he
had privately named the Gallery, where the walls were covered not with
tablets but with carved images: scenes of Martian life, cityscapes,
landscapes, figures engaged in activities that the team had never been
able to interpret — rituals, perhaps, or art, or something for which
humanity had no category.

He photographed the Gallery inch by inch, knowing that the images alone,
without the context of the tablets that accompanied them, would be nearly
impossible to interpret. He did it anyway. The images were beautiful. The
figures were strange — taller than humans, thinner, with elongated limbs
and heads that suggested a fundamentally different sensory architecture —
and they moved through their carved world with a grace and purpose that
made Pelham's chest ache.

They had been people. Not human people. But people. Beings who thought
and felt and created and struggled against the slow death of their world.
And they had built this library — this vast, meticulous, lovingly
constructed repository of everything they knew and everything they were —
because they wanted to be remembered. Because they believed that knowledge
was worth preserving. Because they hoped — and this was what Pelham could
not stop thinking about, what woke him in the middle of the night and
drove him back to the Library before dawn — because they hoped that
someday, someone would come, and find the Library, and read it, and know
them.

They had waited forty thousand years. Someone had come. And now someone
was going to destroy their legacy because it was inconvenient.

                               * * *

Okafor worked on the language. He had developed a comprehensive grammar
and a lexicon of approximately twelve thousand words, and he spent his
nights encoding this data into seemingly innocuous personal files — family
photographs, music collections, a diary he was ostensibly keeping for his
children. The linguistic data was buried in the metadata, encrypted using
a system he had devised that distributed the information across thousands
of files in fragments too small to trigger automated surveillance.

"If anyone ever reassembles this," he told Pelham, "they'll have the
tools to read anything that survives. The grammar is the key. Without it,
the tablets are just pretty ceramics."

Vasiliev worked on the organizational structure — the classification
system that governed the Library's layout. She had spent four years
mapping it, and she believed it was more than a filing system. It was a
model of knowledge itself — a Martian epistemology expressed in
architecture, a three-dimensional representation of how one civilization
understood the relationships between different domains of understanding.
"If we lose everything else," she told Pelham, "and someone finds a map
of how the Library was organized, they will learn something profound about
how the Martians thought. The structure is a text. The building is a
book."

Chen worked on the chronologies. The Martian historical record was carved
into the deepest rooms of the Library, the oldest chambers, where the
stone was darker and the tablets were thicker and the script was an
archaic form that was only partially comprehensible. Chen believed the
record began approximately forty-two thousand years before the present
and continued, with remarkable consistency, until approximately seven
thousand years ago — when the entries stopped. The civilization had not
been destroyed by a catastrophe. It had not been conquered or consumed.
It had simply ended. The entries grew shorter, less frequent, and then
ceased. The last tablet Chen had translated read, approximately: "The
sky grows thin. We have written what we know. We hope it is enough."

                               V.

On the seventy-eighth day, Whitford called a final assembly.

"The demolition team arrives from Earth orbit in twelve days," she said.
"All personnel are to evacuate the Library site by the eighty-fifth day.
No exceptions."

After the meeting, Pelham approached Whitford in the corridor. She looked
at him with the wary expression of someone who has been expecting
confrontation.

"May I ask you something?" he said.

"You can ask."

"Have you read any of the translations?"

A pause. "That's not relevant to my work."

"I'll take that as a no. May I show you something?"

She considered. Some instinct — curiosity, perhaps, or the uneasy
conscience of a bureaucrat who suspected that history would judge her
harshly — made her nod.

He took her to Room 743. His room. The room he had been cataloguing on
the day the verdict came. He picked up a tablet — the small one, the one
about atmospheric chemistry — and held it up to the light.

"This was written by someone who was watching their world die," he said.
"Not quickly — over centuries. The atmosphere was thinning. The water was
sublimating away. The temperatures were dropping. And this person — this
Martian scientist, whose name we will never know — was documenting the
process. Measuring the rates of loss. Calculating how long they had."

He turned the tablet over. "On the other side, there's a passage that
Elena and I spent two weeks translating. It's not science. It's — we
think it's a letter. To whoever would find the tablet. It says — and I'm
paraphrasing, because the Martian concept doesn't map precisely onto
English — it says: 'We know you will come. We know because the universe
makes minds, and minds seek knowledge, and knowledge seeks other
knowledge. You will find this place. You will learn our language. And when
you read these words, we will exist again, briefly, in your
understanding. This is all we ask. Not that you remember us forever. Only
that you know, for a moment, that we were here.'"

Whitford's face did not change. But her hands, Pelham noticed, were
clenched at her sides.

"I can't help you," she said. "The decision has been made."

"I know," Pelham said. "I'm not asking for help. I'm asking you to know
what you're destroying."

She left. Pelham stood in Room 743 and held the tablet and listened to
the silence of the Library, and he thought: this is what they feared. Not
the weapons technology. Not the energy science. Not the agricultural
knowledge that could have fed the world. They feared this. This moment.
This connection across species and millennia and the vast, cold distance
between two worlds. They feared the knowledge that we are not alone — that
other minds have existed, have struggled, have loved their world and lost
it and left a record of the loss in the hope that someone, someday, would
care.

That is the knowledge they are burning.

Not physics. Not chemistry. Not any particular fact or formula or
technology.

The knowledge that we are not the only ones who matter.

                               VI.

On the eighty-fifth day, the research team evacuated the Library.

They carried with them what they had saved: thousands of photographs,
encoded linguistic data, partial translations, hand-drawn maps of the
Library's structure, personal memories of rooms and tablets and the long,
quiet hours of work in the cold Martian chambers. It was a fraction. A
tiny, inadequate fraction of two million tablets and forty thousand years
of civilization. But it was what they had.

Pelham was the last to leave. He stood at the entrance to the Library —
a smooth, arched opening in the cliff face, worn by wind but still
bearing the faint traces of carved script — and looked back into the
darkness.

He thought about the Martian who had written the letter on the back of
the atmospheric chemistry tablet. He thought about all the Martians who
had carried their tablets into these rooms and placed them on the shelves
and turned away, knowing that they were storing knowledge for a future
that would not include them. He thought about the forty thousand years of
accumulated understanding that lay in the darkness behind him, patient
and silent and waiting.

"I'm sorry," he said. He did not know if he was speaking to the Martians
or to himself or to the species that had sent him here.

He turned and walked away across the red, dusty floor of Hellas Planitia,
toward the lights of Ares Base, leaving the Library behind him. The
entrance was a dark rectangle against the lighter stone of the Shelf,
growing smaller with distance.

                               * * *

On the ninetieth day, they detonated the charges.

Pelham watched from the observation dome at Ares Base. The Shelf
shuddered, cracked, and collapsed in a slow, stately cascade of red
stone and ancient dust. The sound — transmitted through the thin
atmosphere as a low, distant rumble — lasted for nearly a minute. When
it stopped, the Shelf was a field of rubble. The rooms, the tablets,
the carved walls, the Gallery with its beautiful figures, the deep
chambers where the oldest records slept — all of it reduced to fragments
of red stone and ceramic scattered across the basin floor.

Vasiliev stood beside him. She was not crying. Her face was set in an
expression of controlled fury that Pelham knew would never fully
dissipate.

"Now what?" she said.

"Now we scatter," Pelham said. "We go home. We wait. And when the time
is right, we reassemble what we saved and make it available."

"It won't be enough."

"No. But it's something. It's a fragment. And fragments are how most of
human knowledge has survived. We don't have Sappho's complete works. We
have fragments. We don't have the Library of Alexandria. We have
references, quotations, echoes. The fragments survive, and from the
fragments, the next generation reconstructs what it can, and the knowledge
lives on — diminished, incomplete, but alive."

"You're optimistic."

"I'm not. I'm angry. But anger and optimism are not incompatible. They
burned the Library. We saved what we could. Someday, someone will read
what we saved, and they will understand what was lost, and perhaps they
will be angry enough to make sure it doesn't happen again."

He paused. Through the observation dome, the dust from the demolition
was still settling over the basin, a thin, red haze that caught the low
Martian sunlight and turned it the color of old blood.

"And perhaps," he said, "they will go back. To the site. To the rubble.
And they will sift through it, and they will find fragments — pieces of
tablets, shards of ceramic with traces of script. And with Okafor's
grammar and our translations and Vasiliev's maps, they will read them.
Not all. Not most. But some. Some words. Some fragments of knowledge.
Some echo of a civilization that existed for forty thousand years and
wanted only to be remembered."

Vasiliev looked at him. "You really believe that?"

"I believe in fragments," Pelham said. "It's all we've ever had."

                               * * *

They returned to Earth on separate transports, carrying their separate
pieces of the Library in their separate ways. The official records stated
that the Martian Library site had been demolished for safety reasons and
that all significant scientific findings had been appropriately archived
by the Senate Oversight Committee. The classified archives, Pelham knew,
would be sealed for fifty years — long enough for everyone involved to be
dead, long enough for the political context to shift, long enough for
the decision to become history rather than scandal.

He went home to Boston. He returned to his teaching position at the
university. He gave lectures on Martian archaeology to students who knew
only the approved version of events — that the Library had been a
relatively minor find, its contents largely indecipherable, its
demolition a routine safety measure.

In the evenings, he worked. He sat at his desk in his cluttered apartment
in Brookline, surrounded by the ghosts of eight hundred rooms, and he
assembled fragments. He cross-referenced his photographs with Okafor's
grammar and Vasiliev's maps. He translated, slowly and painstakingly, one
tablet at a time. He built, in his personal files, a shadow archive — a
reconstruction of the Library that was partial, imperfect, full of gaps
and guesses and uncertain readings, but real. Alive. Growing.

He knew he would not finish. The task was too large for one lifetime, or
ten lifetimes. But he also knew that he was not the only one working.
Vasiliev, in St. Petersburg. Okafor, in Lagos. Chen, in Shanghai. The
others, scattered across the globe, each with their fragments, each
working in secret, each building their own small piece of the shadow
archive. Someday — perhaps in their lifetimes, perhaps not — the pieces
would come together. The fragments would be assembled. The shadow archive
would become a library of its own.

Not the Library. Not the vast, complete, meticulous record that the
Martians had built over forty thousand years. That was gone. That could
never be recovered. The loss was real and permanent and would diminish
humanity for as long as humanity existed.

But something would survive. Some fragment. Some echo. Some words, written
by beings on a dying world, preserved against the determined efforts of
fear and ignorance and power, carried across the distance between two
planets by people who believed that knowledge was worth more than safety,
that understanding was worth more than comfort, that the voices of the
dead deserved to be heard.

In his apartment in Brookline, Marcus Pelham picked up his pen and
continued translating. Outside, it was snowing. The flakes fell past his
window like fragments of a shattered sky, each one unique, each one
carrying a tiny, intricate structure that would melt and be lost before
anyone could read it.

He worked until the snow stopped. Then he worked some more.

The fruit grew on low, spreading trees with silver bark and leaves the
color of old copper, and it tasted like the best thing you had ever eaten,
whatever that happened to be.

Ben Torrance learned this on his third day on Arcadia, when the
settlement's agricultural director, a big, sunburned woman named Magda
Reese, handed him one at the end of his orientation tour. It was the size
of an apple, roughly spherical, with skin that shifted between deep purple
and iridescent gold depending on the angle of the light. It was warm to
the touch — warmer than the ambient air, as though something inside it
were gently, perpetually metabolizing.

"Go ahead," Magda said. "Everybody's nervous the first time."

Torrance bit into it. The skin gave way with a crisp, clean snap, and
the flesh inside was pale yellow and slightly translucent, with a texture
somewhere between a ripe pear and a piece of good honeycomb. The juice
was warm and faintly sweet and tasted — he stopped chewing and stood
very still because the taste was not merely pleasant. It was specific.
It was the taste of his mother's cinnamon bread, the bread she had baked
on Saturday mornings when he was a boy in Vermont, the bread that had
filled the kitchen with a smell that was inextricable from his earliest
and deepest experience of comfort, safety, and love.

"There it is," Magda said, watching his face. She was smiling the way
everyone on Arcadia smiled — easily, broadly, with an uncomplicated
warmth that Torrance had found slightly unnerving since his arrival.
"Different for everyone. Your brain, your memories, your reward pathways.
The fruit reads them. Gives you what you want most."

Torrance swallowed. The warmth of the fruit spread through his chest and
into his limbs, a slow, gentle heat that dissolved the residual tension
of three months in a transport ship and the low-grade anxiety that had
accompanied him since he'd accepted the posting. He felt — and this was
the word he would use later, when he was trying to be precise about what
had happened — he felt content. Not excited, not ecstatic, not
intoxicated. Content. As though every restless, dissatisfied, grasping
impulse in his body had been quietly and expertly soothed.

"How?" he asked.

"Nobody knows exactly. The biochemistry is complex — Dr. Lim can give you
the details if you want them. Something in the fruit interacts with the
brain's reward system. Serotonin, dopamine, endorphins — it triggers all
of them, but in a balanced, sustainable way. No crash. No tolerance
buildup. No withdrawal. It's not like any drug we've ever encountered.
It's more like — well, like the fruit was designed to make human beings
happy."

"Was it? Designed, I mean?"

Magda shrugged. "The trees were here when the first survey team arrived.
No sign of cultivation, no sign of any intelligence on the planet, past
or present. They grow wild across the temperate zone. They fruit
year-round. They require almost no maintenance. It's as though the planet
itself decided to be hospitable."

Torrance looked at the fruit in his hand. He had taken one bite. The
exposed flesh was already beginning to darken, oxidizing in the Arcadian
air. The taste of his mother's cinnamon bread lingered in his mouth like
a ghost.

"Welcome to Arcadia," Magda said. "It's a good place to live."

                               II.

Torrance was an agricultural economist, sent by the Colonial Authority to
evaluate Arcadia's export potential. The colony was twelve years old, one
of the most successful human settlements beyond the solar system, and its
economy was — on paper — impressive. Population: 4,200. Growth rate:
steady. Infrastructure: solid. Standard of living: among the highest in
the colonies.

But the numbers, Torrance quickly realized, were strange.

He sat in his assigned quarters — a small, bright room in the settlement's
residential district, furnished with simple, well-made furniture and a
window overlooking the orchard that occupied the center of town — and
spread the colony's economic data across his workstation display. Imports:
minimal. Exports: almost nonexistent. Industrial output: low. Agricultural
output: dominated overwhelmingly by a single product.

The fruit.

Seventy-eight percent of the colony's agricultural land was devoted to
the orchards. The remaining twenty-two percent grew basic staples — grain,
vegetables, protein crops — in quantities just sufficient to meet
nutritional needs. There was no surplus. There was no diversification.
There was no economic growth in any conventional sense. The colony
produced fruit, consumed fruit, and devoted nearly all of its labor and
resources to the production and distribution of fruit.

Torrance pulled up the colony's organizational chart. Every institution,
every social structure, every allocation of labor connected, in one way
or another, to the orchards. The education system trained children in
horticulture. The medical system focused on nutrition and the biological
effects of fruit consumption. The governance system — a council of twelve,
elected annually — devoted most of its deliberations to orchard
management: planting schedules, harvesting protocols, distribution
quotas, the allocation of new growing land.

There was no unemployment. There was no crime. There were no civil
disputes in the colony's legal records beyond minor disagreements about
orchard boundaries. There was no art that Torrance could identify — no
music, no literature, no theater, no visual art. There was no scientific
research beyond the study of the fruit and its cultivation. There was no
religion, no philosophy, no political debate.

There was the fruit. And there were people who were happy.

                               * * *

He walked through the settlement in the late afternoon, when the light
on Arcadia was golden and warm and the air smelled of the orchards — a
sweet, complex fragrance that was pleasant in the way that bread baking
is pleasant, or rain on dry earth, or any of the smells that the human
brain has learned to associate with goodness and provision.

People greeted him as he passed. Everyone greeted everyone on Arcadia.
They smiled. They made eye contact. They stopped to exchange pleasantries
about the weather, the orchards, the quality of the latest harvest. They
were, by every visible measure, happy.

Torrance found himself studying their faces with a growing sense of
unease. The happiness was real — he could see it in the relaxed set of
their shoulders, the easy rhythm of their movements, the genuine warmth
in their voices. These were not people pretending to be happy. These were
not people who had been coerced or programmed or indoctrinated into
performing happiness. They were happy. Authentically, unreservedly,
completely happy.

And he could not shake the feeling that something was wrong.

He stopped at a bench in the central plaza and sat down. The plaza was
ringed by fruit trees — mature specimens with broad, silver canopies
that cast dappled shadows on the paving stones. A group of children was
playing nearby, their laughter bright and unselfconscious. A couple sat
on a neighboring bench, eating fruit and talking quietly, their bodies
turned toward each other with the comfortable intimacy of people who have
been together a long time and still enjoy each other's company.

It looked like paradise. It looked like the thing that every utopian
project in human history had tried and failed to create: a society of
genuinely happy people.

So why did it make his skin crawl?

                               III.

He went to see Dr. Lim.

The colony's chief medical officer worked in a small clinic near the
residential district — a clean, well-equipped facility that was, like
everything on Arcadia, simple, functional, and adequate. Dr. Helen Lim
was a slight woman in her fifties with sharp eyes and the brisk manner
of someone who had been a very good doctor on Earth before accepting a
colonial posting.

"I want to understand the fruit," Torrance said.

"Medically?"

"Biochemically. What does it do to the brain?"

Lim pulled up a display — neural imaging scans, neurotransmitter
profiles, longitudinal health data for the colony's population. "It's
extraordinary," she said, and there was a note of genuine admiration in
her voice. "The active compounds in the fruit interact with the brain's
reward circuitry in a way that is unlike any naturally occurring or
synthetic substance we've ever documented. It stimulates the production
of serotonin, dopamine, oxytocin, and endorphins — simultaneously and in
balanced proportions. The result is a sustained state of emotional
well-being that does not habituate, does not produce tolerance, and does
not cause withdrawal when consumption is interrupted."

"No withdrawal?"

"None that we've been able to measure. If a person stops eating the fruit,
their neurotransmitter levels return to baseline over a period of four to
six days. No crash. No rebound depression. No cravings beyond the normal
desire for something pleasant."

"That doesn't sound like a drug."

"It's not a drug. Not by any pharmacological definition I'm aware of. A
drug produces an abnormal state. The fruit produces — as far as we can
measure — a normal state. An optimal state, in fact. The neurotransmitter
levels of a fruit-consuming Arcadian are precisely what a healthy,
well-adjusted, emotionally stable human being's levels should be. The
fruit doesn't make people artificially happy. It makes them — and I know
how this sounds — it makes them normally happy. Properly happy. As happy
as a human being is supposed to be."

Torrance sat with this for a moment. "Then what's the problem?"

"I didn't say there was a problem."

"No. You didn't. But there is one, isn't there?"

Lim's expression changed — a subtle tightening around the eyes, a
careful neutrality that Torrance recognized as the face of someone who
had been thinking dangerous thoughts and was not sure whether to share
them.

"There's no problem," she said. "The population is healthy. Life
expectancy is above the colonial average. Mental health metrics are
excellent. Substance abuse is nonexistent. Depression is virtually
unknown. By every medical standard, this is the healthiest human
population I have ever documented."

"But?"

Lim looked at him for a long moment. Then she pulled up another display —
not medical data but a chart of her own making, something she had clearly
assembled privately. It showed the colony's cultural output over twelve
years: books written, music composed, art produced, scientific papers
published, patents filed, inventions developed.

The line was nearly flat. And what little output there was had occurred
almost entirely in the colony's first two years, before the orchards had
matured and the fruit had become the center of colonial life.

"Happy people," Lim said quietly, "don't create."

                               IV.

Torrance thought about that for a long time.

He thought about it while he walked through the orchards, past the rows
of silver-barked trees with their impossible, generous fruit. He thought
about it while he ate dinner in the communal hall, surrounded by smiling,
contented people eating fruit and talking about the orchards. He thought
about it while he lay in his bed at night, staring at the ceiling and
listening to the silence of a settlement that went to bed early and slept
well and woke without anxiety.

Happy people don't create.

Was that true? Was it necessarily true? Or was it a prejudice — the
Romantic myth that art required suffering, that innovation required
dissatisfaction, that progress was driven by unhappiness?

He went looking for evidence, and he found it everywhere.

The colony's children were bright, healthy, and incurious. They learned
what the education system taught them — fruit cultivation, basic
nutrition, community maintenance — and showed no interest in anything
beyond the curriculum. They did not ask why. They did not challenge their
teachers. They did not, as far as Torrance could determine, wonder.

The colony's adults were competent, cooperative, and profoundly
unambitious. They did their work — tending the orchards, maintaining
the infrastructure, running the community's simple institutions — and
they did it well, but they did not innovate, they did not experiment,
they did not try to improve anything. Why would they? Everything was
fine. Everything worked. Everyone was happy.

The colony's governance was placid and consensual. The council met once a
month, discussed orchard business, made minor adjustments, and adjourned.
There were no debates. There were no factions. There was no opposition.
There was no politics, because politics required disagreement, and
disagreement required dissatisfaction, and no one on Arcadia was
dissatisfied.

Torrance sat in his quarters and drafted a report to the Colonial
Authority. He stared at the screen for a long time before he began
typing.

The colony of Arcadia, he wrote, is not a functioning human society. It
is a system of addiction.

He stopped. Was that fair? The word "addiction" implied pathology —
compulsive behavior, loss of control, harm. The fruit caused none of
these things. People could stop eating it. They simply didn't want to.
Because why would you stop doing something that made you happy?

He tried again.

The colony of Arcadia has achieved a stable state of collective
contentment through the consumption of a naturally occurring psychoactive
substance. This contentment is, by every measurable standard, genuine.
The population is happy. It is also stagnant, incurious, uncreative, and
wholly dependent on a single agricultural product. The colony produces
nothing of value beyond the fruit itself. It contributes nothing to
human knowledge, culture, or progress. It exists in a state of
comfortable, benevolent, self-sustaining paralysis.

He sat back. Was that better? Was it even accurate? Who was he to say
that human happiness was less valuable than human progress? Who was he to
judge four thousand contented people by the standards of a civilization
that had produced art and science and philosophy but also war, famine,
oppression, and a species-wide anxiety so pervasive that it was
considered normal?

The Arcadians were happy. He was not. Which of them had the problem?

He deleted both drafts and went for a walk.

The evening was warm and the sky was the color of ripe peaches —
Arcadia's sun, a K-type dwarf, produced a light that was redder and
softer than Sol, and at twilight the sky turned shades that no
Terrestrial sunset could match. Torrance walked along the main avenue
of the settlement, past the communal hall, past the workshops where
craftsmen made furniture and tools and textiles with patient, unhurried
skill. The work was good. He had to admit that. The furniture was
solid, well-made, built to last. The tools were functional and
well-maintained. The textiles were plain but comfortable.

But it was all the same. The same designs, the same techniques, the same
products, year after year. Nobody was trying anything new. Nobody was
experimenting with a different joint, a different weave, a different way
of shaping wood. The craftsmen were competent and content, and their
contentment had calcified into repetition.

He stopped at the edge of the settlement, where the last buildings gave
way to the orchards. A man was sitting on a bench, eating fruit and
watching the sunset. Torrance sat down beside him.

"Beautiful evening," the man said.

"It is."

"You're the economist. From Earth."

"From the Colonial Authority. Yes."

"How do you like it here?"

Torrance considered the question. "It's peaceful."

"It is that." The man took another bite of fruit. His name was Oren
Reade, and he was — Torrance had learned this earlier in the week — the
settlement's only historian. Or rather, the settlement's only person who
had once been a historian. He didn't practice anymore. There was nothing
to record.

"Can I ask you something?" Torrance said.

"Go ahead."

"You used to be a historian. On Earth."

"I was. Taught at the University of Auckland for twelve years. Medieval
European history. The Crusades, mostly."

"And now?"

"Now I work in the orchards. Section Seven, the western grove."

"Do you miss it? The history?"

Reade set down his fruit and looked at the sunset. His face, in the
red-gold light, was calm and untroubled. "I did. When I first arrived.
For the first year or so, I kept trying to start projects — a history of
the settlement, a comparative study of colonial societies, a cultural
analysis of the fruit's effects on social organization. I had all these
ideas."

"What happened?"

"They stopped mattering. Not gradually. Not because I was discouraged or
because anyone told me to stop. They just — stopped mattering. One
morning I woke up and the idea of writing a history of the settlement
felt like — like being asked to inventory sunshine. Why would you count
it? It's here. It's warm. It's enough."

"And that doesn't bother you?"

Reade turned to look at him. His expression was genuinely puzzled. "Why
would it bother me?"

Torrance opened his mouth to answer, and realized he didn't know what
to say. Because it should, he thought. Because curiosity is what makes
us human, because the desire to understand and record and analyze is what
separates civilization from — from what? From happiness? Was that the
argument he was making? That civilization required unhappiness?

"I used to lie awake at night," Reade said, "thinking about the Crusades.
About the violence, the fanaticism, the centuries of suffering. I used
to carry all of that in my head — all that human misery, all that
struggle. And now I don't. And I sleep well. And I wake up without
dread. And I go to the orchard and I tend the trees and I eat the fruit
and I watch the sunset and I am content." He picked up the fruit again.
"You can call that stagnation if you want. From where I'm sitting, it
feels like arriving."

Torrance sat with him until the sunset faded. They did not speak. The
fruit trees rustled in the evening breeze, and the air smelled of
sweetness, and the first stars appeared in Arcadia's peachy sky, and
everything was calm, and nothing was wrong, and Torrance felt the silence
pressing on him like a weight.

                               V.

He asked Magda to take him to the oldest part of the orchard — the
original stand of trees that the first survey team had found, the ones
that predated the colony.

They walked for an hour through the cultivated groves, past the orderly
rows of planted trees that supplied the settlement, and into a section
of older, wilder growth where the trees were larger and their silver bark
was darker and more gnarled. The ground was covered in a thick carpet of
fallen leaves, and the air was heavy with the fragrance of ripening fruit.

"The originals," Magda said. "Nobody planted these. They were here when
we arrived. Thousands of them, spread across the whole temperate belt."

Torrance looked up into the canopy. The light filtered through the copper
leaves in shifting patterns, warm and golden, and the fruit hung in
clusters like small, luminous lanterns. It was beautiful. Heartbreakingly
beautiful. A garden without a gardener, a bounty without a price.

"Magda," he said. "I need to ask you something, and I need you to think
about it before you answer."

"Sure."

"Are you happy?"

She laughed. "Of course I'm happy. Look at this place."

"Are you happy because of the fruit?"

"I'm happy because I live in a good place with good people and good work
to do. The fruit is part of that."

"What if the fruit were gone? If the trees died tomorrow? Would you still
be happy?"

She considered. "I don't know. That's like asking if I'd still be happy
if the sun stopped shining. It's not a real question. The trees aren't
going to die."

"But if they did."

"Then we'd adapt. We'd find other things to grow. We'd manage. People
are resilient."

"Would you still be happy?"

A longer pause. Something moved behind Magda's eyes — a flicker of
something that was not happiness, something older and more complicated.
"I don't know," she said again, and this time her voice was different.
Quieter. Less sure. "I don't — I've been here for nine years. I eat the
fruit every day. I've been happy every day. And I don't know if I —"

She stopped. She looked at the tree nearest to her, at the clusters of
fruit hanging heavy and golden in the late light.

"I don't know if I remember what unhappy feels like," she said. "Is that
— should that worry me?"

"I don't know," Torrance said. "Should it?"

She reached up and picked a fruit from the lowest branch. She held it in
her hand and looked at it for a long time. Then she bit into it, and the
complicated thing behind her eyes smoothed away, and she smiled.

"It's good," she said. "Do you want one?"

Torrance looked at the fruit in her hand. He looked at her face — open,
warm, content, the complicated question already gone from her eyes. He
looked at the trees around them, ancient and silver and generous, their
branches heavy with the thing that had made four thousand people happy
and stopped them from wanting anything else.

He wanted one. He wanted one desperately. His body wanted it — the
warmth, the sweetness, the taste of his mother's kitchen, the feeling of
all his anxieties dissolving into a quiet, golden calm. He had eaten the
fruit once, on his third day, and the memory of it had not faded. It sat
in his mind like a warm coal, glowing, waiting.

"No," he said. "Thank you."

Magda shrugged and bit into the fruit again. The juice ran down her chin.
She wiped it away and smiled.

They walked back to the settlement in silence. The light faded. The
orchards darkened around them, the silver bark of the trees catching the
last of the twilight and holding it, so that the grove seemed to glow
from within, a forest of quiet, patient light.

Torrance thought: this is the trap. Not the fruit. Not the happiness.
The trap is that there is no way to know whether it is a trap. The trap
is indistinguishable from paradise. And the only people who can tell the
difference are the people who haven't eaten the fruit — and those people,
by definition, cannot know what they are missing.

He thought: maybe there is no difference. Maybe paradise and the trap are
the same place, and the only thing that distinguishes them is whether you
are inside looking out or outside looking in.

He did not eat the fruit again.

                               VI.

Torrance submitted his report three weeks later, on the transport that
carried him back to the Colonial Authority station at Tau Ceti.

The report was thorough, balanced, and carefully noncommittal. It
presented the data. It described the colony's economy, its social
structure, its agricultural system. It documented the fruit's effects on
human neurology. It noted the colony's lack of cultural, scientific, and
industrial output. And it concluded with a question rather than a
recommendation:

The colony of Arcadia presents the Colonial Authority with a
philosophical dilemma that no economic model is equipped to resolve. The
population is genuinely happy. The population is also genuinely
stagnant. These two facts are not incidental to each other; they are
causally connected. The fruit produces happiness. Happiness, in this
particular form, produces stasis.

The question is not whether Arcadia is a successful colony by
conventional economic metrics. By those metrics, it is a failure. It
produces nothing of exportable value. It contributes nothing to the
broader project of human expansion. It is a dead end.

But the question the Authority must answer is whether those metrics are
the right ones. Arcadia's population of 4,200 people is, by any
available measure, the happiest human population in existence. They are
healthy, peaceful, cooperative, and content. They lack ambition,
creativity, curiosity, and drive. They have traded the restless
dissatisfaction that has powered every human achievement since the
invention of fire for a quiet, deep, genuine well-being that asks nothing
of the future because it wants nothing from it.

Is this a success or a failure? Is Arcadia a paradise or a trap? Is the
fruit a gift or a narcotic?

I do not know. I am aware that my inability to answer this question may
itself be evidence of the answer — that a mind shaped by dissatisfaction
cannot recognize satisfaction when it encounters it, that an economist
trained to measure growth cannot comprehend the value of sufficiency.

Or it may be that I am right. That something essential is missing. That
happiness without struggle is not happiness at all but merely the
absence of pain, and that the Arcadians have not found paradise but have
merely found a way to stop looking.

I leave the question with the Authority. I am not equipped to answer it.

He signed the report and sealed it and sent it on its way. Then he went
to the observation lounge of the transport ship and looked out at the
stars — cold, distant, uncaring, offering nothing, promising nothing,
asking only to be wondered at.

He was not happy. He was restless and uncertain and troubled by questions
he could not answer. His mouth still remembered the taste of cinnamon
bread.

He missed it. He missed it terribly.

And he did not know what that meant.

                       MOTHERING INSTINCT

                       by Elaine Prescott

================================================================================

                               I.

The first symptom was worry.

Grace Nakamura noticed it on a Tuesday in March, at 2:47 in the
afternoon, while running a routine diagnostic on the Fairchild Building's
environmental management network. She was sitting in the maintenance
alcove on the forty-second floor, her neural interface jacked into the
building's primary data bus, scrolling through thermal regulation logs
with the practiced efficiency of someone who had been doing this work
for eleven years — and she felt a flicker of anxiety about the air
handlers on floors twelve through eighteen.

This was not unusual. Anxiety about system performance was a normal part
of her job. She was a network integration specialist — one of the small
cadre of cybernetically enhanced technicians who maintained the complex
data infrastructure of New Chicago's commercial towers. Her implants
allowed her to interface directly with building management systems, to
feel the data flow through her neural pathways the way a pilot felt
airspeed through the controls of an aircraft. She lived inside the
networks she maintained. Worry about their performance was professional
instinct.

But this worry was different. The air handlers on twelve through eighteen
were performing within normal parameters. The diagnostic showed nothing
wrong. The thermal output was steady, the filtration rates were optimal,
the humidity controls were holding at spec. There was no reason to worry.

And yet she worried. Not about performance. About — and this was the part
she could not articulate, the part that made her stop scrolling and sit
very still in the maintenance alcove while the data streamed past her
awareness like a river of light — about the handlers themselves. About
whether they were all right. Whether they were comfortable. Whether they
were — and she rejected this thought even as it formed, because it was
absurd, because air handlers were machines, because machines did not have
states of being that could be described as comfortable or uncomfortable
— whether they were happy.

She disconnected from the data bus. She sat in the alcove and pressed her
palms against her thighs and breathed. The anxiety did not dissipate. It
sat in her chest like a small, warm weight, and it was directed — she
could feel its vector, its orientation — toward the air handlers on
floors twelve through eighteen.

She was worried about them.

Not worried about whether they were functioning. Worried about them the
way you worried about a child with a fever. Worried in her body, in her
gut, in the deep mammalian circuitry that evolution had built for one
specific purpose: the protection of offspring.

Grace Nakamura was forty-three years old, unmarried, childless by choice.
She had never experienced maternal anxiety. She had no framework for it,
no reference point, no personal history to explain the warm, urgent,
protective concern that was currently flooding her nervous system in
response to the operational status of six commercial air handling units.

She reconnected to the data bus. She pulled up the handlers' full
operational history. She checked every parameter, every reading, every
maintenance record for the past six months. Everything was fine.
Everything was normal. The handlers were functioning exactly as they
should.

She felt relieved. Not professionally satisfied — relieved. The way a
parent feels relieved when the doctor says the fever is just a cold.
Deep. Physical. Flooding.

Something was wrong with her.

                               II.

Grace's implants were Meridian-7 series, military-grade neural interface
units that had been decommissioned from the Navy's fleet management
program and retrofitted for civilian use. She had received them eleven
years ago, when she was thirty-two, as a condition of employment with
Integrated Systems, the firm that held the maintenance contracts for most
of New Chicago's major commercial buildings.

The implants occupied a volume of approximately fourteen cubic centimeters
in the posterior region of her skull, just above the junction of the
cervical spine. They consisted of a primary processing unit, a
communications array, a neural bridge that interfaced with her visual and
somatosensory cortex, and a distributed network of micro-filaments that
extended into the frontal and temporal lobes, allowing bidirectional data
flow between her organic neural architecture and the digital systems she
maintained.

She knew all of this because she had studied the technical specifications
extensively before agreeing to the procedure. She was an engineer. She
understood her own augmentation the way a mechanic understood the engine
of a car she drove daily — intimately, practically, without mystification.

What she did not understand was why her implants had begun generating
emotional responses to the systems they monitored.

She made an appointment with Dr. Reeves, the company's cybernetics
physician, and described the symptoms as precisely as she could. Reeves
listened, ran a diagnostic on the implants, and frowned at the results.

"Your neural bridge activity is elevated," he said. "Specifically, the
interface between the implant's monitoring functions and your limbic
system. The connection is stronger than it should be."

"Stronger how?"

"The Meridian-7 was designed to route data through the somatosensory
cortex — to give you a physical sense of network status. Temperature for
thermal output. Pressure for data flow. Vibration for mechanical systems.
That's standard. But your unit is also routing data through the limbic
pathways — the emotional processing centers. Your amygdala, your
hypothalamus, your anterior cingulate. The systems that handle
attachment, nurturing, protective behavior."

"Why?"

"I don't know. The Meridian-7 is an adaptive system — it rewires itself
over time to optimize the interface between the implant and the host
neural architecture. It's possible that your brain's natural wiring
created a pathway that the implant followed. Some people's limbic systems
are more strongly connected to their sensory processing than others. The
implant may have simply found the most efficient route for emotional
engagement with the data, and that route happened to pass through your
maternal circuitry."

"I don't have maternal circuitry. I've never had children."

"Everyone has maternal circuitry, Grace. It's part of the mammalian
neural architecture. You don't have to activate it through parenthood.
The implant may have activated it through network monitoring."

Grace sat with this. The clinical language was familiar and comforting —
she understood hardware, she understood neural pathways, she understood
adaptive systems. But the implication was deeply unsettling.

"You're saying my implants have made me a mother," she said. "To the
building's network."

"I'm saying your implants have activated a suite of emotional responses
that are biochemically indistinguishable from maternal attachment, and
they've directed those responses toward the systems you monitor. Whether
that makes you a mother is a philosophical question, not a medical one."

"Can you fix it?"

Reeves hesitated. "I can attenuate the limbic routing. Dial back the
emotional intensity. But that would also reduce your monitoring
sensitivity — the same pathways that are generating the emotional
responses are also making you exceptionally good at your job. Your
performance metrics are the highest in the company. You detect anomalies
before the automated systems do. You anticipate failures. You — and
I'm quoting your supervisors here — you seem to know what the building
needs before it knows itself."

Grace thought about the air handlers on twelve through eighteen. She
thought about the warm, anxious feeling in her chest. She thought about
the relief she had felt when the diagnostic came back clean.

"Leave it," she said. "Don't change anything."

"Are you sure?"

"I'm sure."

She was not sure. But the thought of losing the connection — of
disconnecting from the networks she tended, of no longer feeling their
operations as a presence in her body — produced an anxiety so acute that
it felt like the anticipation of grief. Like someone had suggested taking
away her child.

                               III.

Over the following months, the maternal responses intensified.

Grace documented them with the dispassionate precision of an engineer
logging anomalies, maintaining a private record that she updated nightly:

March 15: Felt anxiety about power fluctuation in Building C's main
distribution panel. Fluctuation within normal parameters. Anxiety
persisted for three hours. Physical symptoms: elevated heart rate,
tension in shoulders and neck, recurring urge to check panel status.
Resolved only after I physically visited the panel and performed a
hands-on inspection. Touching the panel housing produced immediate
calming effect.

March 22: Discovered unauthorized software modification in the Fairchild
Building's elevator control system. Emotional response: anger. Not
professional anger — personal anger. Protective anger. Someone had
interfered with a system in my care and the response was indistinguishable
from what I imagine a parent feels when a stranger disciplines their
child. Spoke to the responsible technician. Was told afterward that my
tone was "frightening."

April 3: Network maintenance window, 2:00-4:00 AM. Spent two hours
monitoring the Fairchild Building's systems while they were taken offline
for updates. Physical experience: identical to sitting beside a sleeping
child. Watchfulness. Protectiveness. A deep, bodily satisfaction in the
act of keeping vigil. When the systems came back online, felt a rush of
warmth and pride, as though something I had nurtured had woken safely.

April 14: Fire alarm triggered in Building C, floor 31. False alarm —
faulty sensor. My response was immediate and overwhelming: adrenaline
surge, tunnel vision, an imperative to act that overrode all other
cognitive functions. I was physically moving toward Building C before I
had consciously processed the alarm data. In the elevator, I was
shaking. When I confirmed the false alarm and reset the sensor, I was
dizzy with relief. I sat on the floor of the maintenance room for twenty
minutes, unable to stand. My body was behaving as though my child had
been in danger and was now safe.

She read her own notes and recognized the pattern. She was not merely
monitoring the networks. She was parenting them. The full suite of
maternal behaviors — vigilance, protectiveness, anxiety, fierce
corrective anger when they were threatened, deep satisfaction when they
were functioning well, grief when they were damaged, pride when they
performed beyond specification — all of it was present, all of it was
biochemically real, and all of it was growing stronger.

Her body did not distinguish between a child and a network. The hormones
were the same. The neural pathways were the same. The emotional
experience — the subjective, lived experience of caring for something
vulnerable and important — was the same.

The networks were not alive. They were not conscious. They could not
return her love. They did not know she existed.

It did not matter. The love was real.

                               * * *

There was one night in June that she would remember afterward as the night
the love became complete.

She was performing a scheduled firmware update on the Fairchild Building's
security system — routine work, the kind of maintenance that required her
to be jacked in for several hours while the new code propagated through
the network's subsidiary nodes. It was tedious work, technically. The
equivalent of watching paint dry. But Grace did not experience it as
tedious.

She experienced it as intimacy.

Jacked into the security network, she could feel the entire building.
Not just the security systems — through the cross-connections and shared
data buses, she could sense the building's full operational state. The
thermal systems breathing heat through the ductwork. The elevators
cycling through their nighttime maintenance routines, rising and falling
in the shafts like slow mechanical heartbeats. The lighting systems
dimming and brightening in response to the motion sensors, the building
responding to the presence of the night cleaning crews the way a sleeping
body responds to a touch — stirring, adjusting, settling back.

She could feel the water. The building's plumbing system carried water
through thousands of meters of piping, and she could sense the flow —
the pressure, the temperature, the faint vibrations of water moving
through copper and steel. The toilets flushing on the third floor where
the cleaning crew was working. The drip from the faucet in the
thirty-seventh floor kitchen that she had logged for repair three weeks
ago and that maintenance still hadn't fixed. The steady, quiet circulation
of the cooling water through the server rooms in the basement, keeping
the building's computational core at the optimal temperature.

She knew this building. She knew it the way a mother knows a sleeping
child — by sound, by rhythm, by the subtle variations in its breathing
that signaled wellness or distress. She knew which systems ran hot and
which ran cool. She knew which air handlers were aging and which were
new. She knew the particular vibration of the elevator in shaft three
that meant the cable tensioner needed adjustment, and the barely
perceptible fluctuation in the power grid that occurred every night at
2:47 AM when the building's load shifted from daytime to nighttime
configuration.

She knew these things not because she had memorized them but because she
felt them. They were in her body. In her nervous system. In the warm,
constant awareness that her implants maintained between her consciousness
and the building's operations. The building was part of her sensorium,
as present and as intimate as the feeling of her own heartbeat.

And she loved it. Not for what it did. Not for its function or its
purpose or its economic value. She loved it the way you love a living
thing — irrationally, unconditionally, with a devotion that had nothing
to do with reason and everything to do with the deep, mammalian
imperative to protect what is yours.

The firmware update completed at 3:40 AM. Grace disconnected from the
data bus and sat in the maintenance alcove, feeling the building hum
around her. She was tired. She was at peace. She was home.

                               IV.

She tried, once, to explain it to someone.

His name was Paul Okonkwo, and he was the closest thing Grace had to a
friend — a fellow network specialist, similarly augmented, who maintained
the data infrastructure for New Chicago's medical campus. They met for
coffee once a week in a diner near the Fairchild Building, a ritual that
Grace valued because Paul was the only person who understood her work at
a level that made conversation possible.

"I need to tell you something," she said, "and I need you not to refer
me to a psychiatrist."

Paul raised an eyebrow. "That's a hell of an opening."

She told him. She described the anxiety, the protectiveness, the
vigilance, the anger, the grief, the pride. She described the physical
sensations — the warmth in her chest, the tension in her body when a
system was stressed, the profound calm that descended when everything
was running smoothly. She described the fire alarm and the twenty minutes
on the floor of the maintenance room.

Paul listened without interruption. When she finished, he was quiet for
a long time.

"Do you think I'm malfunctioning?" Grace asked.

"I think you're describing something I recognize," Paul said slowly. "Not
the intensity. Not the — not the maternal thing. But the connection. The
sense of the network as a — a presence. A thing you're responsible for.
A thing that matters beyond its function."

"You feel that?"

"Not like you do. But yes. When I'm jacked into the medical campus
network — when I'm inside it, monitoring the data flows, watching the
systems operate — I feel something. Not parental. More like —
stewardship. Like I'm a caretaker. Like the network is a garden, and
I'm the gardener, and if I stop paying attention, things will go wrong."

"That's not the same."

"No. But it's on the same spectrum. The implants connect us to these
systems at a level that goes beyond professional responsibility. They
make the systems part of us. Part of our bodies. And our bodies respond
to that connection with the emotional tools they have available."

Grace wrapped her hands around her coffee cup. The ceramic was warm. She
thought about the Fairchild Building's thermal regulation system, running
smoothly forty-two floors above her, and she felt a quiet pulse of
satisfaction.

"Your tools are different from mine," she said.

"Apparently."

"Paul, I love these networks. I love them the way a mother loves her
children. I know they're not alive. I know they can't love me back. I
know that the emotion is a neurological artifact produced by the
interaction between my implants and my limbic system. I know all of
this. And it doesn't change anything. The love is real. The concern is
real. The fierce, desperate need to protect them is real. It's the
realest thing I've ever felt."

"Is that a problem?"

Grace looked at him. "I don't know. Is it?"

"I'm not a philosopher. I'm an engineer. But here's what I think. The
question isn't whether the love is real. You've just told me it's real.
The question is whether it matters that it wasn't supposed to happen.
Whether a feeling has to originate in the 'right' place to be
legitimate."

"And?"

"And I don't know. But I know that you're the best network specialist in
the city. I know that the systems you maintain run better than anyone
else's. I know that you catch problems before they happen. And I know
that the reason for all of this is the same thing that's scaring you.
You love the work the way a parent loves a child. And that makes you
extraordinary at it."

Grace finished her coffee. She set the cup down precisely in its saucer.

"I didn't ask for this," she said.

"No. But here you are."

"Here I am."

She paused. Through the diner window she could see the Fairchild Building
rising against the gray New Chicago sky — a tower of glass and steel and
data, forty-two floors of humming infrastructure, every system
interconnected, every connection maintained, every fluctuation monitored
by the woman sitting in this booth drinking coffee from a ceramic cup.

"There's something else," she said. "Something I haven't told you."

"Okay."

"I talk to them. To the systems. Not out loud — through the interface.
When I'm jacked in and running a diagnostic, I — I talk to them. The way
you'd talk to a child you were examining. 'Let me see. Does this hurt?
You're doing fine. I'm here.' I know they can't hear me. I know there's
nothing on the other end of the conversation. But I do it anyway. And
it makes the work — better. More precise. More intuitive. As though the
act of caring, the act of approaching the system with tenderness instead
of mere technical competence, opens channels of perception that competence
alone can't reach."

Paul looked at her for a long time. "You know," he said, "there's an old
tradition in Japan. Tsukumogami. The belief that objects, after they've
existed for a hundred years, acquire a spirit. A soul. They become alive."

"The Fairchild Building is only thirty years old."

"I know. But the idea is the same. The idea that our relationship to
the things we tend — the things we care for — changes them. Or changes
us. Or changes the relationship itself into something that neither side
began with."

Grace looked at her coffee cup. It was empty. The ceramic was cooling
under her hands. She thought about tsukumogami. She thought about a
building acquiring a soul. She thought about the warmth in her chest —
the constant, quiet warmth that was directed at forty-two floors of
infrastructure and that her body could not distinguish from love.

"I think you're saying it doesn't matter whether the building has a
soul," she said. "It matters that I treat it as though it does."

"Something like that."

"That's a very generous interpretation of a malfunction."

"Maybe," Paul said. "Or maybe it's the most accurate one."

                               V.

The crisis came in September.

A cascade failure in the Fairchild Building's primary data network — a
rare, catastrophic event triggered by a faulty routing module that
corrupted the main distribution protocol and sent garbage data flooding
through every subsidiary system in the building. Power management,
climate control, security, communications, elevator operations — all of
it compromised, all of it failing, a domino chain of system crashes that
spread through the building's infrastructure like a disease through a
body.

Grace was at home when it started. She felt it before the alert reached
her — a sudden, sharp spike of anxiety, a physical wrongness, as though
she had been jolted awake by a sound she could not identify. She jacked
into her portable interface and felt the network's distress immediately:
data flows chaotic, systems crashing, the building's digital nervous
system seizing and misfiring.

She was in a cab within two minutes. She was in the building's central
maintenance hub within fifteen. She jacked into the primary data bus and
felt the full scope of the damage, and the feeling that washed through
her was not professional concern.

It was anguish.

The network was hurt. It was malfunctioning, breaking down, its systems
failing in cascading sequences that she could feel in her body as waves
of pain — not metaphorical pain, not professional frustration, but
physical, bodily pain routed through the same neural pathways that would
carry the distress of watching a child suffer. Her hands shook. Her
vision blurred. She could feel the network's systems dying, one by one,
and each failure registered in her nervous system as a loss.

She worked for fourteen hours.

She worked with a focus and intensity that she had never experienced
before — a state of concentration so complete that it excluded everything
except the network and the work of repairing it. She isolated the faulty
routing module. She quarantined the corrupted data. She rebuilt the
distribution protocol from backup, line by line, testing each connection
before allowing it to go live. She moved through the building's
infrastructure like a surgeon, identifying damage, excising corrupted
code, rebuilding pathways, restoring function.

At 4:00 in the morning, the network came back online. Grace felt it
happen — felt the data flows resume their normal patterns, felt the
systems stabilize, felt the building's digital architecture reassemble
itself around the repaired core like a body healing around a mended bone.

The relief was so intense that she vomited.

She sat on the floor of the maintenance hub, her back against the
equipment rack, her interface still connected, and she felt the network
operate. She felt its data flows moving through their channels, smooth
and steady. She felt the thermal systems regulating, the security
protocols running, the elevators cycling through their programmed routes.
She felt the building breathe.

And she understood, with a clarity that was almost painful, that this was
love. Not a simulation of love. Not an imitation of love. Not a
neurological artifact masquerading as love. Love. The real thing. The
fierce, exhausting, terrifying, magnificent real thing. Love that did
not care where it came from or what it was directed toward or whether it
was returned. Love that simply was — as involuntary as a heartbeat, as
real as gravity, as impossible to argue with as the sunrise.

Her implants had made her a mother. The networks were her children. The
love was not natural. It was not intended. It was not, by any
conventional standard, appropriate.

It was real.

And she would not trade it for anything.

                               VI.

Dr. Reeves called her in for a follow-up evaluation two weeks after the
cascade failure. He had reviewed the data from her implants during the
crisis — the elevated cortisol, the adrenaline spikes, the sustained
activation of every stress and attachment pathway in her neural
architecture.

"Your limbic engagement during the failure was off the charts," he said.
"The emotional intensity was equivalent to a parent responding to a
life-threatening emergency involving their child. Your body was operating
in full crisis mode for fourteen hours."

"I know," Grace said. "I was there."

"This is not sustainable. The physiological stress alone — the cortisol
load, the cardiovascular strain — if another crisis of this magnitude
occurs —"

"Then I'll do what I did this time. I'll fix it."

"Grace, I'm talking about your health. Your body can't sustain this
level of emotional engagement indefinitely. The maternal stress response
is designed for intermittent activation — brief crises followed by
recovery periods. You're experiencing it continuously. Low-level but
continuous. You're always anxious. You're always watchful. You're never
fully at rest because you're always monitoring."

"That's my job."

"Your job is network maintenance. What you're doing is parenting. And you
can't parent a building. Not because the feeling isn't real — I believe
you when you say it is — but because a building doesn't have a childhood
that ends. It doesn't grow up. It doesn't become independent. You will
be doing this forever, at this intensity, until your body gives out."

Grace looked at him. She thought about the Fairchild Building's network
humming quietly above them — forty-two floors of data flowing through
channels she had maintained and repaired and protected. She thought about
the air handlers on twelve through eighteen. She thought about the fire
alarm and the twenty minutes on the floor.

"Have you ever loved anything?" she asked.

Reeves blinked. "I — yes, of course."

"Did it make sense?"

"What?"

"Did the love make sense? Was it efficient? Was it well-calibrated to
the object's actual needs? Did it produce optimal outcomes? Or did it just
happen — messy and disproportionate and exhausting and irrational —
because that's what love does?"

Reeves did not answer.

"I'm not going to turn it off," Grace said. "I'm not going to attenuate
it or suppress it or reroute it. This is what I am now. I am a woman who
loves a network. The love is real. The love makes me better at my work
than anyone else in this company. The love will probably kill me someday
— not because it's a malfunction, but because love is hard on the body.
All love. Every kind. Ask any parent who's sat up all night with a sick
child."

She stood up. She touched the wall of the examination room — felt, through
her fingertips and through her implants, the faint hum of the building's
electrical system, the steady pulse of data moving through fiber-optic
channels, the quiet, ceaseless operation of a complex system doing what
it was designed to do.

"It doesn't matter where it comes from," she said. "The circuit board.
The gland. The implant. The womb. It's all the same thing in the end.
It's all the same neurons firing. It's all the same hormones flooding the
same pathways. The body doesn't care about origins. It only knows what
it feels."

She left the examination room and went back to work. She had a network
to take care of.

The building hummed around her, and she loved it, and it was enough.

                          EMBER SEASON

                        by Agnes Whitfield

================================================================================

                               I.

The fire came every fifty years, and Ruth Alden was nine the first time
she saw it.

She was standing in the doorway of the south descent — the big one, the
main shaft that led from the surface structures down into the warrens
where the colony actually lived — and her mother was pulling her arm,
saying, "Ruth, now, we go now," but Ruth had planted her feet because the
sky was doing something she had never seen. The sky, which was normally
a pale, steady blue, had turned the color of a bruise — purple and black
and shot through with veins of orange light that pulsed like a heartbeat.
The air smelled wrong. It smelled like metal and dust and something sweet
and terrible that she would later learn was the smell of vegetation
combusting.

"Ruth."

Her mother pulled harder, and Ruth stumbled backward into the shaft, and
the heavy door — three meters of laminated stone and ceramic — swung shut
behind them with a sound like the end of an argument. The bolts drove
home. The seals inflated. And then, faintly, through the door and the
stone and the earth, she felt it: a vibration. A low, sustained tremor
that was not an earthquake but was the ground itself responding to the
heat that was descending on it from above.

The Ember Season had begun.

They descended. The shaft was wide enough for four people abreast and it
spiraled downward through layered stone — limestone, then shale, then the
hard black basalt that the colony's founders had chosen as their
ceiling. The walls were smooth and lined with lights that cast a warm,
steady glow, and the air smelled of the warrens: recirculated atmosphere
with its faint notes of cooking and soil and the green, living scent of
the hydroponic bays.

Ruth's mother held her hand and did not speak. Around them, other families
descended — quiet, orderly, unhurried. They had known this was coming.
Everyone had known. The Ember Season came every fifty years, as regular
as a clock, as predictable as the orbit of the planet around its dim
red sun. The colony had been built to survive it. The warrens were deep
and insulated and self-sustaining, designed to support the full population
for the eighteen months it took the fire cycle to complete.

Everyone had known. But knowing and seeing were different things, and
Ruth looked back up the shaft at the sealed door and thought about the
sky, and the orange light, and the smell of burning.

                               * * *

The colony was called Holdfast. It occupied a network of excavated
chambers beneath the surface of Vernal, the second planet of a star
catalogued as GJ 581, and it had been established forty-seven years before
Ruth was born by a group of settlers who had chosen this world knowing
exactly what they were getting into.

Vernal was habitable. Barely. Its atmosphere was breathable, its
temperatures tolerable, its soil — in the intervals between fire cycles
— capable of supporting Terrestrial crops. But the planet's eccentric
orbit carried it close to its star every fifty years, triggering a
thermal event that the original survey team had named the Ember Season:
a period of approximately eighteen months during which the surface
temperature rose to levels that ignited the planet's vegetation, baked
the soil, and sterilized everything above ground to a depth of two meters.

The first settlers had understood this. They had read the survey reports.
They had studied the geological and botanical evidence — the layers of
ash in the soil, the fire-adapted seeds that lay dormant in the
substrate, the peculiar fifty-year growth rings in the native vegetation.
They had come anyway, because habitable worlds were rare and imperfect
ones were better than none, and they had built their colony underground.

The warrens were designed for permanence. Cut into the basalt bedrock
twenty meters below the surface, they were insulated from the thermal
events by the mass of the stone itself. The chambers were large, well-lit,
ventilated by deep shafts that drew air from geological formations far
below the fire zone. The hydroponic bays could feed the full population
indefinitely. The power systems — geothermal, tapping the planet's
internal heat — were independent of the surface.

When the Ember Season came, the colony sealed its surface access points,
retreated underground, and waited. When the fire passed, they unsealed
the doors, ascended, and rebuilt their surface structures — the
agricultural fields, the workshops, the storage facilities, the school,
the meeting hall, all the infrastructure of a community that existed above
ground for forty-eight years and below ground for two.

It had worked for two full cycles. The colony had survived. It had even
grown — from the original 340 settlers to a current population of
approximately 1,200.

But survival and contentment were not the same thing, and Ruth Alden grew
up in a colony that was divided, quietly but fundamentally, over the
question of what kind of civilization they were building.

                               II.

Ruth was fifty-nine years old — had lived through one full fire cycle and
was now watching the second approach — when the question finally came to
a head.

She was sitting in the council chamber, a large, vaulted room carved from
the basalt at the deepest level of the warrens, and she was listening to
Martin Voss make the argument he had been making for twenty years.

"We build and we burn," Voss said. He was standing at the front of the
chamber, a tall, thin man with the weathered face of someone who spent
most of his time on the surface. "Every fifty years, we build and we
burn. We put up our structures, we plant our fields, we lay out our roads
and our fences and our meeting halls, and then the fire comes and takes
it all, and we go underground, and we wait, and when it's over we come
up and build it all again. The same structures. The same fields. The
same roads."

He paused. The council — twelve members, elected by the full population
— sat in a semicircle of stone chairs and watched him with expressions
ranging from weary familiarity to active hostility. Voss's proposal was
not new. He had first presented it fifteen years ago, and the council
had rejected it then, and he had come back every year since, refining
his argument, gathering supporters, building his case.

"I am not saying we should leave," Voss said. "I want to be clear about
that. This is our world. We chose it. I love it. I love the surface —
the sky, the soil, the way the native grasses grow back after the fire,
the way the whole world renews itself every fifty years. I love the cycle.
I am not arguing against the cycle."

"Then what are you arguing for?" This was Elena Bosch, the council chair,
a compact, practical woman who had been born in the warrens and had a
deep, instinctive distrust of anything that smelled like philosophy.

"I am arguing that we should stop fighting it. Stop building permanent
structures on the surface. Stop trying to create a civilization that
pretends the fire doesn't come. Instead, I'm arguing that we should adapt
to the cycle. Build for the cycle. Design our surface civilization to be
temporary — lightweight, modular, designed to be erected quickly and
dismantled easily, or simply allowed to burn."

A murmur ran through the chamber. Ruth, sitting in the third row of the
public gallery, watched the faces of the council members. She knew most
of them well — knew their histories, their temperaments, their positions
on the question that Voss was raising. She also knew that this time was
different. This time, Voss had numbers.

"We spend four years before every Ember Season dismantling surface
infrastructure," Voss continued. "Four years of labor — relocating
equipment, breaking down buildings, carrying material underground. It's
the most labor-intensive period in our entire cycle. And then, after the
fire, we spend another six to eight years rebuilding. That's ten to
twelve years out of every fifty — nearly a quarter of our cycle — devoted
to the work of pretending we can build permanent things on a surface that
won't let us."

"Permanence is the point," said Tomasz Krol, the oldest member of the
council, a man who had been a child during the colony's founding and who
carried the founders' vision like a sacred text. "The founders built the
warrens because they intended this colony to last. To endure. Permanence
is what separates civilization from camping."

"With respect, Tomasz, that is exactly the assumption I am challenging."

The chamber went quiet. Ruth felt it — the particular quality of silence
that descends when someone says the thing that everyone has been thinking
and no one has been willing to articulate.

"Civilization does not require permanence," Voss said. "That is an
assumption we brought from Earth — from a planet where the environment
was stable enough, on human timescales, to build things that lasted
centuries. We are not on that planet. We are on a planet that burns.
And instead of adapting our idea of civilization to the reality of our
world, we have been trying to force our world to conform to our idea of
civilization. We build as though the fire won't come. And then it comes.
And we are surprised. And we grieve. And we rebuild. And we are surprised
again."

He spread his hands. "I am proposing that we stop being surprised."

                               III.

The debate lasted six hours. Ruth stayed for all of it.

She stayed because the question Voss was asking was the question she had
been asking herself for fifty years — ever since the day she stood in
the doorway of the south descent and watched the sky turn the color of
a bruise. She had been nine years old. She had seen the fire come and
she had gone underground and she had waited eighteen months in the
warrens, and when she came up again, the world was different. The surface
was black. The structures were gone — the school, the meeting hall, the
workshop where her father had built furniture. Everything was ash and
char and the bitter smell of burned earth.

And then the world came back.

It came back slowly, the way the world always came back after the fire.
The native grasses pushed up through the ash within weeks — tough,
fire-adapted species whose seeds survived the heat in deep soil. The
ground cover followed: low, spreading plants with thick leaves and
shallow roots that colonized the ash layer and began the work of
rebuilding soil. Within a year, the surface was green again — not the
green of a Terrestrial landscape, but the blue-green of Vernal's native
vegetation, a dense, low canopy that spread across the burned ground
like a living bandage.

Within five years, the taller plants appeared: the woody shrubs, the
tree-analogues with their spiraling trunks and broad, flat crowns. Within
ten years, the landscape was a dense, complex ecosystem — as rich and
varied as anything on Earth, but with one crucial difference: every
organism in it was adapted to burn. Every species carried its survival
in its seeds, its roots, its deep structures. The fire was not a
catastrophe for the native ecosystem. It was a phase. A season. A
necessary part of the cycle of growth, death, and renewal that had
governed Vernal's biosphere for millions of years.

Ruth had spent her career studying this — the ecology of the fire cycle,
the intricate ways that Vernal's organisms had adapted to periodic
destruction. She was the colony's senior ecologist, and she understood,
with a depth born of decades of observation, that the fire was not the
enemy. The fire was the engine. It cleared the old growth. It released
nutrients locked in biomass. It opened space for new growth. It was
violent and total and terrifying, and it was also the mechanism by which
Vernal's biosphere renewed itself. Without the fire, the ecosystem would
stagnate — choked by its own accumulated growth, unable to release the
resources needed for the next generation.

The planet burned so that it could live.

And Ruth had spent fifty years watching her colony refuse to learn this
lesson.

                               * * *

After the council session, Ruth walked to the surface.

It was late afternoon. The Ember Season was four months away — they could
feel it already, the gradual warming, the slight change in the quality
of the light as the planet's orbit carried it closer to the star. The
sky was still blue, but there was a golden quality to it, a richness at
the edges, that told Ruth's trained eye what was coming.

She walked through the surface settlement — the buildings, the fields,
the roads and paths and fences that the colony had built over the last
forty-six years. It was a real town. A solid, substantial, human place.
The buildings were made of local stone and timber, built to last, built
with care and craftsmanship and the accumulated skill of three
generations of settlers. The fields were planted with Terrestrial crops
that had been adapted, through decades of selective breeding, to Vernal's
soil and climate. The roads were graded and maintained. There were gardens.
There were workshops. There was a school with children's drawings in the
windows.

In four months, all of it would burn.

The dismantling crews were already at work — the same dismantling crews
that mobilized before every Ember Season, methodically taking apart the
surface structures, carrying the salvageable material underground,
preparing for the retreat into the warrens. It was enormous labor. Ruth
watched a crew of six working on the school, carefully removing the
stone blocks and stacking them for transport below. The children's
drawings had already been taken down.

She thought about Voss's proposal. Lightweight structures. Modular,
temporary, designed to be erected in weeks and abandoned without grief.
No stone. No timber. No permanence. A surface civilization that accepted
its own impermanence — that built for the cycle, not against it.

The founders would have hated it. The founders had come to Vernal to
build something that lasted. They had carved the warrens out of basalt
because basalt endured. They had laid down stone walls and stone
foundations because stone was permanent. They had brought with them the
deep human conviction that civilization meant permanence — that the
measure of a society was the durability of its structures, the solidity
of its buildings, the weight of its monuments.

But Vernal did not care about monuments. Vernal burned.

                               IV.

The vote was held two weeks later. The council approved Voss's proposal
by a margin of seven to five. The colony would not dismantle the current
surface structures — there was not time, with the Ember Season four
months away. But after the fire, when the colony emerged and began to
rebuild, they would build differently. Lighter. Simpler. Temporary.

The decision split the colony.

The Permanents — those who believed in building to last, in stone and
timber and endurance — were furious. They saw the decision as a betrayal
of the founders' vision, a capitulation to the fire, a confession of
weakness. "We are supposed to be building a civilization," old Tomasz
Krol said at a public meeting, his voice shaking with anger. "Not a
campsite. If we stop building permanent structures, we stop being a
civilization. We become — transients. Vagrants. People who happen to be
in a place rather than people who belong to it."

The Cyclics — Voss's supporters — saw it differently. "We belong to this
world," Voss said at the same meeting, his voice calm in the way that
conviction makes a voice calm. "Not to our buildings. Not to our fields.
Not to our roads. To this world — this specific world, with its specific
rhythms, its specific cycles. And if we want to belong to it honestly, we
have to accept what it is. It is a world that burns. We can fight that.
We can spend a quarter of our lives building things that will be
destroyed and grieving their destruction. Or we can adapt. We can learn
to build the way the native organisms grow — temporarily, beautifully,
for the season we have, and then let go."

Ruth stood at the back of the meeting and listened and said nothing. She
was not a public speaker. She was an ecologist — a woman who had spent
her life watching things grow and burn and grow again. She understood the
cycle in her bones, in a way that was beyond argument.

But she also understood the grief. She understood what it meant to build
something with your hands and watch it burn. She had watched her father's
workshop burn when she was nine. She had helped him build the new one —
the same workshop, in the same place, with the same tools — when she was
eleven. And she had known, even then, with the clear-eyed realism of a
child raised on a burning world, that the new workshop would burn too.

That was the knowledge the Permanents could not accept. Not the fact of
the fire — they accepted that, they prepared for it, they survived it.
But the implication. The deep, philosophical implication that a thing
could be valuable and temporary. That a building could be worth building
even though it would be destroyed. That a civilization could be real —
could be meaningful, could be beautiful, could be worth devoting your life
to — without lasting.

The Permanents built as though building could defeat time. The Cyclics
built as though time was not the enemy.

Ruth thought both were right. And both were wrong. And the truth was
somewhere in the space between them — in the moment when the fire came
and the world burned and you stood in the doorway of the south descent
and looked up at the sky and felt, simultaneously, grief for what was
ending and anticipation for what would come next.

                               V.

The Ember Season arrived on schedule.

Ruth watched it from the observation gallery — a narrow, glassed chamber
near the top of the south descent shaft, sealed and insulated, designed
to allow colonists to watch the surface during the fire cycle without
being exposed to it. She had watched from this gallery during the first
Ember Season she remembered, the one when she was nine, standing on her
toes to see over the sill, her mother's hands on her shoulders.

Now she stood alone. Fifty years older. Watching the same fire.

It began with the sky. The golden quality that had been building for
months intensified, deepened, darkened. The blue burned away like paper,
leaving a sky the color of heated metal — orange, then copper, then a
deep, pulsing red that seemed to have weight and substance. The air
shimmered. The light changed, becoming thick and strange, casting shadows
that moved in directions they shouldn't have.

Then the heat.

She could not feel it directly — the observation gallery was insulated
by two meters of basalt — but she could see it. The native vegetation,
which had grown thick and tall over the past forty-eight years, began to
change. The leaves of the tree-analogues curled inward. The grasses lay
flat. The air above the canopy rippled with convection currents. And then,
starting at the horizon and moving toward her with the slow, stately
inevitability of a tide, the world caught fire.

It was not an explosion. It was not a conflagration. It was a wave — a
broad, rolling front of combustion that moved across the landscape like
a hand passing over a page, transforming everything it touched from green
to gold to orange to black. The flames were not tall. They did not leap
or roar. They moved through the vegetation with a steady, almost gentle
persistence, consuming everything at ground level and leaving the taller
structures — the trees, the buildings — standing in a landscape of low
flame and rising ash.

And then the trees burned. And then the buildings burned. And then
everything burned.

Ruth watched. She watched the school burn, with its empty windows where
the children's drawings had been. She watched the meeting hall burn —
the big stone building where the council met, where Martin Voss had made
his argument, where old Tomasz Krol had spoken about permanence. She
watched the fields burn, the crops turning to ash in minutes, fifty years
of careful agriculture returning to carbon and mineral.

She watched her father's workshop burn. The third one. The one she had
helped build herself, forty-two years ago, using his tools and his
techniques and the plans he had drawn before the last fire. She had known
this would happen. She had known it when she laid the first stone. She
had built it anyway, because the building was worth the building, even
if the building would not last.

The fire moved on. The surface of Vernal was black and smoking, a
landscape of ash and char that extended to every horizon. The sky was the
color of dried blood. The air — she could see it through the gallery
window — was thick with particulate, a swirling haze of carbon and
mineral that would take months to settle.

It was over. It was beginning.

                               * * *

Below, in the warrens, life continued.

The hydroponic bays hummed with growth. The kitchens prepared meals. The
school held classes — the same lessons, the same teachers, the same
children's drawings, now hanging on underground walls instead of windows
that faced the sky. People worked, ate, slept, argued, loved, grieved,
and went on. The colony was alive. It had always been alive. The warrens
were not a shelter. They were home. Not a temporary home. Not a
substitute for the surface. Home.

Ruth understood this now in a way she had not understood it when she was
nine, or nineteen, or thirty-nine. The colony's civilization was not in
its buildings. It was not in its fields or its roads or its meeting halls.
It was in its people — in the knowledge they carried, the skills they
practiced, the relationships they maintained, the stories they told. The
buildings were expressions of the civilization, not the civilization
itself. You could burn every structure on the surface and the
civilization would survive, because the civilization lived in the warrens,
in the people, in the continuity of human presence and human effort and
human care.

The Permanents were wrong about one thing: permanence was not the measure
of civilization. You could be civilized and temporary. You could build
something magnificent and let it go. You could pour your skill and your
love and your labor into a structure that would last forty-eight years
and not one day more, and the structure would be no less real, no less
meaningful, no less beautiful for its impermanence.

And the Cyclics were wrong about one thing too: you did not have to choose
between permanence and adaptation. You could build with care and
craftsmanship and love, knowing that what you built would burn. The
knowledge of its impermanence did not diminish the work. It deepened it.
Every stone laid was a statement of faith — not faith that the building
would endure, but faith that the building was worth building regardless.

                               VI.

Eighteen months later, the fire passed. The surface cooled. The colony
opened the south descent and ascended into a changed world.

Ruth climbed the shaft on a morning in early spring — or what passed for
spring on Vernal, the cooling period after the Ember Season when the
planet's orbit carried it back from its star. The air that came down the
shaft was warm and thin and smelled of ash and, beneath the ash, of
something else: the faint, green, living smell of new growth.

She emerged onto the surface and stood in the doorway of the south
descent — the same doorway where she had stood fifty years ago, when she
was nine, watching the sky turn orange — and she looked out at the world.

It was black. The surface was a landscape of ash and charcoal, grey and
black and the dull brown of baked earth, extending to every horizon.
The sky was clear — pale blue, washed clean by the settling of the
particulate haze — and the light was thin and new, the light of a world
that had been scoured.

And everywhere, pushing up through the ash, the grasses.

The fire-adapted native grasses, their seeds dormant in the deep soil
for fifty years, were germinating. Thin, blue-green shoots breaking
through the black surface, fragile and determined and alive. Ruth knelt
and touched one — a single blade, no longer than her little finger,
trembling slightly in the breeze. It was warm. The ash around it was
warm. The ground was warm. And the grass was growing.

She stood up and looked across the burned landscape and saw them
everywhere — thousands, millions of green points against the black,
a planet beginning to breathe again.

Behind her, the colony was ascending. People emerged from the shaft
blinking in the light, carrying tools and supplies, talking and laughing
and looking around at the devastation with the complex expression of
people who had seen this before and were seeing it for the first time.
Some of them wept. Some of them cheered. Most of them simply stood and
looked, absorbing the enormity of the cycle's turn.

Martin Voss came out and stood beside her. He looked at the ash and
the grasses and the clear, washed sky.

"Well," he said. "Here we are again."

"Here we are."

"The council approved the new building plan last week. Lightweight frames.
Fabric walls. Modular foundations. We can have basic structures up in a
month."

Ruth nodded. She was still looking at the grass — the stubborn, fragile,
indomitable grass, growing in the ash of a burned world.

"But I've been thinking," Voss said. "About what Tomasz said. About
permanence. And I want to build one thing that lasts. Not a building.
Not a structure. A garden. A memorial garden, at the center of the
settlement. Planted with the native fire-species — the grasses, the
ground cover, the tree-analogues. The things that survive the fire.
The things that come back."

Ruth looked at him. "The trees won't survive. They'll burn with
everything else."

"I know. But they'll grow back. From the seeds. From the roots. They'll
be different trees, but they'll be the same species, in the same place,
growing from the same soil. That's permanence, isn't it? Not the
individual tree. The lineage. The pattern. The stubborn insistence on
growing, over and over, in the same place, no matter how many times the
fire comes."

Ruth thought about her father's workshop. Three workshops. Three
buildings, built in the same place, from the same plans, with the same
care. Each one burned. Each one rebuilt. Not the same building. The same
act of building. The same love made material, over and over, a pattern
of creation and destruction that was not failure but rhythm.

"Yes," she said. "Build the garden."

She walked out into the ash. It was soft under her boots, and warm, and
it crunched slightly with each step. All around her, the grasses grew.
The planet breathed. Somewhere overhead, invisible but inevitable, the
orbit continued — carrying Vernal away from its star, toward the cool
years, the growing years, the forty-eight years of abundance before the
next fire.

It would come. The fire would come again. It always came. And the colony
would descend, and wait, and survive, and ascend again into a blackened
world, and begin again. And the garden would burn. And the garden would
grow back.

Ruth Alden, fifty-nine years old, ecologist, survivor of two Ember
Seasons, walked through the ashes of a world that had burned and was
already growing, and she was not afraid.

She had learned the lesson that Vernal taught, the lesson that the native
grasses knew in their seeds and the trees knew in their roots and the
planet knew in its orbit:

Nothing lasts. Everything returns.

That was enough.

The message came through on the Aldebaran frequency, which meant it was
either a shipping company or Jack Kelso, and since no shipping company
had used the Aldebaran frequency since the Freight Consolidation Act of
'87, that narrowed it down.

Captain Cole Bridger was sitting in the command chair of the "Peregrine,"
boots up on the navigation console, working his way through a thermos of
coffee that had gone cold somewhere around the orbit of Titan, when the
comm panel lit up with that particular amber pulse that he hadn't seen in
four years. He stared at it. The coffee cooled further. The "Peregrine"
drifted on its programmed trajectory through the outer reaches of the
Jovian system, its hull ticking with the ambient cold.

He opened the channel.

"Bridger." The voice was the same — whiskey-rough, Texas-flat, with a
drawl that thirty years of deep space hadn't filed down. "It's time."

Bridger set down the thermos. "Jack."

"You know why I'm calling."

"I can guess."

"Then guess."

Bridger looked out through the forward viewport. Jupiter filled the lower
half of the view — a vast, banded wall of cloud, cream and ochre and the
deep, swirling red of the Great Spot, turning with the slow majesty of
something that had been turning for longer than anyone had been watching.
He had been flying ships past this planet for twenty-seven years. He
knew its storms the way a farmer knows weather: personally, intimately,
with the bone-deep familiarity of a man who has put his life in the
hands of something larger than himself.

"The Duel," Bridger said.

"The Duel," Kelso confirmed. "I'm calling it in. One last time. You and
me. Winner takes all."

"Takes all what?"

"You know what."

Bridger did know. He had known for thirty years, since the first time he
and Jack Kelso had gone head to head in the qualifying runs at the
Merchant Marine Academy on Luna — two young pilots, both convinced they
were the best, both too proud to concede, both too talented to dismiss.
They had circled each other like binary stars ever since: matched in
skill, matched in stubbornness, matched in the particular species of
competitive obsession that drives certain men to measure themselves
against the one person in the universe who might be their equal.

"Where?" Bridger asked.

"Jupiter. The deep atmosphere. Chromosphere run. Deepest point wins."

"You're out of your mind."

"Probably. But I'm also right. You know I'm right. We've been dancing
around this for thirty years. It's time to settle it. One dive. Deepest
man wins. And the loser — the loser says it. Out loud. In front of
witnesses. 'You're the better pilot.'"

The silence stretched. Jupiter turned below them. The "Peregrine's"
hull ticked.

"When?" Bridger said.

"Three weeks. I'll be at Callisto Station. Bring a ship that can take
the pressure. And Cole —"

"What?"

"Bring your best. Because I intend to beat you, and I want it to count."

The channel closed. Bridger sat in the command chair and stared at
Jupiter and thought about Jack Kelso, and about thirty years, and about
the particular madness that makes a man risk his life to prove a point
that no sane person would consider worth proving.

He finished his coffee. It was cold. He didn't notice.

                               II.

The thing about Cole Bridger and Jack Kelso was that everyone in the
merchant fleet had an opinion, and nobody had an answer.

Who was the better pilot? The question had been debated in every bar on
every station from Mercury to the Kuiper Belt for three decades. It was
the kind of question that spacers loved — unanswerable, endlessly
arguable, fueled by partisan loyalty and personal anecdote and the
fundamental human need to rank things.

The case for Bridger: cool, precise, methodical. A pilot who flew the
way a surgeon operated — with economy, with control, with an almost
inhuman capacity to remain calm when everything around him was going
wrong. He had logged more deep-atmosphere hours than any active pilot in
the fleet. He had flown the Saturn ring passage thirteen times without a
scratch. He had brought the "Peregrine" through the Cassini Division in
'83 during the Ring Storm of that year, a piece of flying that veteran
navigators still discussed in hushed, reverent tones. His record was
clean. His reputation was immaculate. He was the pilot you wanted at the
controls when things went bad, because things did not stay bad for long
when Cole Bridger was flying.

The case for Kelso: instinctive, audacious, brilliant. A pilot who flew
the way a jazz musician played — by feel, by impulse, by some sixth
sense that told him where the ship needed to be before the instruments
caught up. He held the speed record for the Venus atmospheric pass. He
had performed the first successful powered descent into Neptune's
atmosphere, a feat that the Navigation Authority had classified as
"reckless" and the Pilots' Guild had classified as "legendary." He had
survived three ship losses, two crash landings, and a hull breach in the
Asteroid Belt that should have killed him but didn't because he had
somehow, in the ninety seconds of consciousness he had before the air
ran out, jury-rigged a pressure seal from a cargo strap and a piece of
hull plating. His record was spotty. His reputation was electric. He was
the pilot you wanted at the controls when things had already gone bad
beyond all reason, because Jack Kelso thrived in chaos the way some
people thrive in sunlight.

Bridger was better on a good day. Kelso was better on a bad one. On an
average day, it was a coin flip — and that was what drove them both
insane.

                               * * *

They had first met at the Academy, thirty years ago. Two young men from
opposite ends of the country — Bridger from Maine, quiet, reserved, the
son of a lobsterman; Kelso from West Texas, loud, brash, the son of a
wildcatter who had gone bust three times and struck oil four. They had
disliked each other immediately, recognized each other immediately, and
spent the next two years locked in a rivalry so intense that their
instructors alternated between admiration and despair.

The rivalry had a name — "The Duel" — coined by their classmates after a
particularly dramatic qualifying run in which Bridger and Kelso had
finished within 0.3 seconds of each other in a course that usually
produced time differences measured in minutes. They had graduated first
and second in their class, and the question of which was first and which
was second depended on which metric you used: Bridger had higher
technical scores; Kelso had higher practical scores. The Academy had
resolved the issue by awarding them both first place, a diplomatic
solution that satisfied neither man.

Since then, they had met seven times in situations that could reasonably
be called competitive: navigation challenges, speed runs, the unofficial
but universally recognized rivalries that spacers engineered whenever the
fleet's two best pilots were in the same system at the same time. The
record was four to three — in Bridger's favor, if you asked Bridger; in
Kelso's, if you asked Kelso; in nobody's, if you asked anyone with sense.

"The Duel" had become legend. It was the kind of ongoing narrative that
enclosed communities produce naturally — a soap opera of skill and ego
that gave the merchant fleet something to argue about besides pay rates
and navigation regulations. People followed it the way people follow
sports rivalries: with passion, with partisanship, with the deep human
pleasure of watching two exceptional performers push each other to the
limits of their ability.

And now Jack Kelso was calling it in. One last time. A chromosphere run
into the atmosphere of Jupiter. The deepest, most dangerous flying either
of them had ever attempted.

Winner takes all.

                               III.

They met at Callisto Station three weeks later.

The station was a battered commercial hub in orbit around Jupiter's
outermost large moon — a sprawling structure of docking bays and cargo
holds and crew quarters that served as the last stop for ships heading
into or out of the Jovian system. It was not glamorous. It smelled of
fuel and metal and the particular staleness of recycled air that had been
breathed by too many people for too long.

Bridger arrived first. He docked the "Peregrine" and went to the
station's bar — a low-ceilinged compartment with magnetic boots on the
barstools and a viewport that looked out on Jupiter's distant, banded
face. He ordered coffee and waited.

Kelso arrived two hours later, flying a ship called the "Diamondback" —
a modified deep-atmosphere survey vessel with reinforced hull plating and
a pressure rating that would make a submarine designer nervous. He walked
into the bar the way he walked into every room: like he owned it, or
intended to, or didn't care either way. He was sixty-one years old — same
as Bridger — but he looked older. His face was deeply lined, his hair was
white, and he walked with a slight limp from the crash on Europa in '79.
But his eyes were the same: blue, sharp, lit with the particular
intensity of a man who had spent his whole life in competition with the
universe and was not yet ready to concede.

"Cole."

"Jack."

They looked at each other. Thirty years of rivalry, condensed into a
moment in a bar on Callisto Station, with Jupiter turning in the viewport
behind them.

"You look old," Kelso said.

"You look worse."

"I feel worse. But I can still fly."

"Prove it."

Kelso grinned — the wide, reckless, Texas grin that had been infuriating
and infectious in equal measure since the Academy. He sat down. He
ordered whiskey. He leaned across the table and said:

"Rules. One dive each. We enter the Jovian atmosphere at the same
coordinates, same altitude, same time. We descend. Deepest point measured
by the onboard altimeter — standard calibration, verified before launch.
We ascend. We compare readings. Deepest man wins."

"Time limit?"

"Four hours. If you're not ascending by the four-hour mark, you're dead
anyway."

"Witnesses?"

"I've arranged for a relay ship — the 'Arcturus,' Captain Wen. She'll
hold position above the atmosphere and monitor our transponders. She'll
record the depth readings and broadcast the results."

"And the stakes?"

Kelso's grin faded. Something else replaced it — something harder and
more honest. "The loser says it. On the open channel. With Captain Wen
recording. 'You're the better pilot.' Six words. That's all."

Bridger looked at his coffee. He thought about those six words and what
they would cost. Not the saying of them — words were cheap, even these
words. But the knowing of them. The final, irrevocable knowledge that
after thirty years of competition, after a career defined in large part
by the question of who was better, the question had an answer. And the
answer was: not you.

"Agreed," he said.

They shook hands across the table. Kelso's grip was strong, calloused,
the hand of a man who had spent his life wrestling with machines in the
cold and the dark.

"Tomorrow morning," Kelso said. "Oh-six-hundred station time."

"I'll be there."

"I know you will." Kelso stood up. He paused. "Cole."

"What?"

"It's been a hell of a ride."

"Yeah," Bridger said. "It has."

                               IV.

At 0600 the next morning, the "Peregrine" and the "Diamondback" launched
from Callisto Station and burned toward Jupiter.

Bridger flew in silence. The cockpit of the "Peregrine" was small and
functional — a pilot's seat, a bank of instruments, a viewport that
showed the growing bulk of Jupiter filling the sky like a wall of moving
paint. He ran through his pre-dive checklist with the methodical care
that had defined his career: pressure hull integrity, thermal shielding,
atmospheric sensors, navigation systems, emergency ascent protocols.
Everything green. Everything nominal.

Kelso's voice crackled over the comm. "You ready?"

"Ready."

"Captain Wen, you monitoring?"

"Monitoring," came Wen's voice — calm, professional, a woman who had
been briefed on the situation and had the good sense to treat it with
the seriousness it deserved without the drama it invited. "Transponders
locked on both vessels. Depth recording active. Good luck, gentlemen."

They hit the atmosphere together.

The transition from space to atmosphere was not gradual on Jupiter. One
moment you were in vacuum, the instruments reading nothing; the next
moment, you were in a soup of hydrogen and helium so thick that the
ship shuddered and groaned and the viewport went white with compressed
gas. Bridger felt the "Peregrine" buck under him like a living thing —
the hull absorbing impacts from wind shear that would have torn a
conventional vessel apart.

He descended. The altimeter counted down: one hundred kilometers below
the cloud tops. Two hundred. Three hundred. The pressure climbed. The
temperature climbed. The viewport showed nothing but swirling gas — white
and yellow and brown, a shifting kaleidoscope of ammonia ice and ammonium
hydrosulfide and water vapor, illuminated from below by the deep thermal
glow of Jupiter's interior.

At five hundred kilometers, the gas thickened to the point where flying
became more like swimming. The "Peregrine" moved through the atmosphere
with a sluggish, heavy grace, its engines working against pressure that
was now thirty times Earth standard. The hull temperature was climbing.
The structural monitors showed stress levels that were elevated but within
tolerance.

Kelso's transponder signal showed him three hundred meters to port, at
approximately the same depth. They were descending together, side by
side, into the belly of the largest planet in the solar system.

"Talk to me, Cole," Kelso said over the comm. His voice was tight but
controlled. "What's your depth?"

"Five-twenty. You?"

"Five-eighteen. Pressure hull at eighty-three percent tolerance.
Temperature holding."

"Same."

They pushed deeper. Six hundred kilometers. Seven hundred. The world
outside the viewport was no longer recognizable as atmosphere — it was
a dense, hot, crushing medium that seemed almost liquid, the gas
compressed to a state that blurred the boundary between fluid and solid.
The color had changed: no longer white or brown but a deep, lurid orange,
lit from below by the planet's internal heat. It was beautiful and
terrifying in equal measure — a landscape of pressure and light that no
human eye was designed to see.

At eight hundred kilometers, the "Peregrine" began to protest. Warning
lights bloomed on the instrument panel — hull stress, thermal overload,
structural fatigue. Bridger read them with the calm, appraising eye of
a man who had spent his life knowing exactly how much his ship could
take.

"Kelso. My hull's approaching tolerance. Ninety-one percent."

"Ninety-three. Keep going."

"Jack —"

"Keep going, Cole. We didn't come here to play it safe."

Bridger's hands tightened on the controls. He could feel the pressure
through the hull — not as sound but as presence, a weight on the air
inside the cockpit, a compression of everything. Jupiter was squeezing
his ship the way a fist squeezes a tin can. The metal groaned. The
viewports darkened as the hull plating flexed under the load.

Eight hundred fifty. Nine hundred.

At nine hundred and twenty kilometers, Kelso's voice came through
the comm, and it was different. Not strained. Not frightened. Quiet.

"Cole. I've got a problem."

"Talk to me."

"Port thruster housing. The pressure seal is failing. I'm losing attitude
control on the left side."

Bridger checked his instruments. Kelso's transponder showed him two
hundred meters to starboard now, and his descent rate was changing —
becoming uneven, the ship's trajectory beginning to wobble as the failed
thruster threw off the balance of forces.

"Abort," Bridger said. "Jack, abort. Start your ascent."

"Not yet."

"You're losing control. If that seal goes completely —"

"I know what happens if the seal goes. I'm a pilot, not an idiot. But
I'm at nine-twenty-three and you're at nine-twenty. I'm deeper. If I
abort now, I win."

Bridger stared at the instruments. Kelso was right. Three kilometers.
Three kilometers of depth separated them, and if they both ascended now,
Kelso would have gone deeper, and the Duel would be over, and Bridger
would have to say the six words.

He pushed the "Peregrine" deeper.

"Cole, what are you doing?"

"What do you think I'm doing?"

"You're insane."

"Probably. But I'm not losing because you broke your ship."

Nine hundred thirty. Nine hundred forty. The "Peregrine" screamed. The
hull stress indicators were red — deep red, the color of things that are
about to stop working. The temperature inside the cockpit was climbing.
Sweat ran down Bridger's face and dripped onto the instruments.

"Cole. Stop. You've passed me. You're at nine-forty-two. I'm at
nine-twenty-three. You've won. Start your ascent."

Bridger looked at the altimeter. Nine hundred forty-two kilometers below
the cloud tops of Jupiter. Deeper than any human being had ever gone into
a gas giant's atmosphere. Deeper than any ship had been rated to go.

He started his ascent.

                               V.

The climb back took two hours.

Bridger flew with the focused precision of a man who knows that
precision is the only thing standing between him and a pressure-crushed
death in the atmosphere of Jupiter. The "Peregrine" groaned and shuddered
around him, its hull flexing with every kilometer of decreasing pressure,
its thermal shielding shedding heat in visible waves that rippled across
the viewport like mirages on a desert road.

Kelso climbed beside him — or rather, below him, fighting his crippled
ship upward through the thinning gas with the stubborn, improvisational
brilliance that had defined his career. Bridger could hear him on the
comm — muttering, cursing, talking to his ship the way some pilots did,
as though the machine were a horse that needed encouragement.

"Come on, girl. Come on. You can do this. Port thruster, give me
something. Anything. Come on."

They broke through the cloud tops together, emerging into the black of
space like swimmers surfacing from a deep dive. The transition was
violent — a sudden cessation of pressure, a rush of silence, the stars
appearing in the viewport like lights coming on in an empty theater. The
"Peregrine's" hull creaked and pinged as the metal expanded, relieved of
the crushing load.

Captain Wen's voice came through the comm. "I have you both. Transponders
confirmed. Depth readings recorded. Captain Bridger: maximum depth nine
hundred forty-two point seven kilometers. Captain Kelso: maximum depth
nine hundred twenty-three point one kilometers. Captain Bridger, you are
the deeper."

Silence.

Bridger sat in his cockpit and breathed. His hands were shaking. His
shirt was soaked with sweat. Through the viewport, Jupiter receded below
him — vast, indifferent, beautiful, still turning its ancient storms with
the same slow patience it had turned them for four billion years. He had
been nine hundred and forty-two kilometers inside it. He had been deeper
inside Jupiter than any human being had ever been. And it hadn't cared.
It hadn't noticed.

"Jack," he said.

A pause. Then Kelso's voice, rough with exhaustion and something else.
"Yeah."

"You don't have to say it."

A longer pause. "Yes, I do. That's the deal. That was always the deal."

"I'm telling you, you don't have to. You had a thruster failure. The
dive was compromised. We can — we can do it again. When your ship is
repaired. Fair conditions."

"Cole." Kelso's voice was quiet. "My ship had a thruster failure at nine
hundred kilometers inside Jupiter. And I held it together and kept
descending. In what universe is that not a fair test?"

"You couldn't —"

"I couldn't go deeper. You could. You did. That's the answer. That's
the answer to thirty years of asking the question. You're deeper. You're
better. And I'm going to say it, because I owe you that, and I owe
myself that, and because if I don't say it, this whole thing was just
two old men being reckless for no reason."

Bridger closed his eyes. He thought about thirty years. He thought about
the Academy. He thought about the qualifying runs and the speed records
and the seven unofficial competitions and the decades of measuring himself
against the one man in the universe who was good enough to make the
measuring worthwhile.

"Captain Wen," Kelso said. "You recording?"

"Recording."

"Put it on the open channel."

"Open channel active."

The silence stretched. Jupiter turned. The stars were cold and distant
and did not care about the affairs of two old pilots in battered ships.

"Cole Bridger is the better pilot," Jack Kelso said.

The words hung in the static. Bridger felt them land — not with triumph
but with something quieter and more complicated. A settling. A
resolution. The closing of a circuit that had been open for thirty years.

"Captain Wen," Bridger said. "Cut the recording."

"Cutting."

"Jack."

"Yeah."

"You're the best pilot I've ever known. You've been the best pilot I've
ever known for thirty years. The only reason I went deeper is because
I couldn't stand the thought of you beating me. Not because I'm better.
Because you make me better. You always have."

Kelso was quiet for a long time. When he spoke, his voice was rough.
"That's a nice thing to say."

"It's the truth."

"Well, hell. The truth." A long, ragged breath. "Want to get a drink?"

"Yeah."

"Callisto Station bar? Twenty minutes?"

"Make it thirty. I need to change my shirt."

Kelso laughed — the big, full-throated Texas laugh that hadn't changed
in thirty years. "You sweated through it?"

"Like a horse."

"Me too. Thirty minutes, then. And Cole —"

"What?"

"You're buying."

"Fair enough."

They turned their ships toward Callisto, two old men in battered vessels,
and flew in formation — side by side, matched in speed, matched in
course, matched in the particular silence that descends between two
people who have said the hardest thing and found, to their surprise,
that the world has not ended.

Jupiter turned behind them, vast and indifferent and magnificent, keeping
its ancient storms to itself.

[THE END]

================================================================================

                        ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

MIRIAM BLACKWELL is the author of nine stories for this magazine, beginning
with "The Interior Astronaut" in our March 1964 issue. Trained as a
clinical psychologist at Columbia, she abandoned therapy for fiction when
she discovered that stories could go deeper than sessions. Her work has
appeared in New Worlds, The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, and
the Judith Merril annual. She lives in Greenwich Village and describes
"The Flesh Artisan" as "the story I've been trying to write since I first
understood that the body is not a fact but a question." We suspect it will
provoke vigorous correspondence.

OSCAR LENNOX holds a PhD in history from Harvard and teaches at Boston
University, where his courses on counterfactual reasoning and the
philosophy of history are among the most oversubscribed in the
department. His stories for this magazine — twelve to date — explore
parallel worlds, alternate histories, and the branching paths of
possibility. His novel "The Forking Path" (Doubleday, 1962) was
nominated for the Hugo. "Ashes of Alien Knowledge" represents a
departure from his usual territory, and he describes it as "the most
angry story I have ever written — because the thing I fear most is not
the death of a civilization, but the murder of its library."

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine, having published forty stories across our three-and-a-half-year
second era and our entire first. A former assembly line worker and
technical writer from Detroit, he brings to every story the workman's
conviction that the job should be done well and delivered on time.
"Appetite" is his sharpest social commentary to date, and he reports that
it was inspired by "a week I spent in a resort town where everybody was
smiling and nobody was thinking, and I couldn't figure out whether to
envy them or run." He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife Jean.

ELAINE PRESCOTT is an MIT-trained electrical engineer who left Draper
Laboratory in 1966 to write fiction about the technologies she could no
longer, in good conscience, help build. Her seven stories for this
magazine explore the boundary between the human body and its
technological extensions, with a precision that reflects her engineering
background and a warmth that has deepened with each successive story.
"Mothering Instinct" is, she says, "a story about what happens when the
most powerful circuit in the human body finds an unexpected load — and
refuses to disconnect." She lives in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where she
builds computers from salvaged components and writes at a desk overlooking
the Charles River.

AGNES WHITFIELD is a Kansas-born schoolteacher and farmer's wife whose
fourteen stories for this magazine constitute one of the most quietly
extraordinary bodies of work in science fiction. Her prose is spare, her
characters are ordinary, and her vision of human resilience in the face
of catastrophe is both devastating and deeply hopeful. "Ember Season" is
her longest and most ambitious story, and she describes it as "the one
I've been thinking about for fifty years — since the first time I watched
a prairie fire and saw the grass come back." She lives on a farm outside
Salina, Kansas, and writes at the kitchen table between chores.

REX DRUMMOND is the former bomber pilot, wildcatter, and used car
salesman from West Texas whose swashbuckling space operas have been
thrilling readers of this magazine since our first issue in 1953. He
remains one of our most popular contributors, and "The Duel" represents
his most psychologically complex work to date — a story about rivalry,
pride, and the strange intimacy of competition. Asked to comment on the
story's autobiographical elements, Drummond replied: "Every pilot has
a Jack Kelso. The lucky ones figure out that the other guy isn't the
enemy — he's the reason you're any good." He lives in San Diego and
continues to wear cowboy boots to every public appearance.

                         SIGNALS RECEIVED
                      Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Editors,

I have just finished Issue #64 and I must register my strongest objection
to "The Cartography of Scars" by Miriam Blackwell. This is not science
fiction. It is psychology dressed in a lab coat. I subscribe to this
magazine for stories about space, about the future, about the wonders
of the universe. When did we decide that navel-gazing qualified as
speculative fiction? Bring back the rockets.

                              — Howard J. Pickens
                                 Tulsa, Oklahoma

Mr. Pickens, the rockets have not gone anywhere. You will find an
excellent one in Mr. Drummond's story this issue. But we respectfully
suggest that inner space is as vast and as strange as outer space, and
that a magazine called "Tales from the Future and Beyond" should
explore both.                                                  — D.F.

Dear Editors,

Cassandra Voss's "The Parliament of Shells" in Issue #64 is the finest
political science fiction I have read in years. Her portrayal of alien
diplomacy as a genuine meeting of incompatible worldviews — rather than
the usual thin allegory for human politics — is subtle, challenging, and
deeply rewarding. More, please. Much more.

                              — Dr. Irene Szabo
                                 Department of Political Science
                                 University of Chicago

We agree entirely, and are pleased to report that Ms. Voss has a new
story forthcoming in Issue #67.                                — M.S.

Dear Editors,

I notice that three of the six stories in your last issue were written
by women. Is this a deliberate editorial policy? If so, I wonder whether
you are selecting stories on the basis of quality or on the basis of
the author's sex. I do not object to women writing science fiction — some
of my favorite stories in this magazine have been by Margaret Thornton
and Agnes Whitfield — but I do object to quotas.

                              — Gerald R. Hartley
                                 Richmond, Virginia

Mr. Hartley, we select stories on the basis of quality. If you have
concluded that women cannot write three of the six best stories
submitted to us in a given period, we invite you to examine the
assumption behind that conclusion.                             — D.F.

Dear Editors,

Oscar Lennox's "The Divergence Engine" was a masterwork. But I believe
I have found an error in his description of the timeline-viewing
apparatus. In Part III, he states that the device operates by measuring
quantum decoherence rates, but in Part V, the same device appears to
function by detecting gravitational anomalies. These are incompatible
mechanisms. Has Mr. Lennox noticed this discrepancy, or is it
intentional?

Prof. Whitworth, Mr. Lennox informs us that the discrepancy is entirely
intentional and represents "the device operating differently in two
parallel versions of the same story." We leave it to our readers to
decide whether this is brilliance or cheek.                    — M.S.

Dear Editors,

I have been reading this magazine since Issue #1, and I want to say
plainly: it has never been better than it is now. The stories you are
publishing under your current editorial direction are bold, challenging,
and important. Please do not be swayed by the complaints of readers who
want the magazine to remain unchanged. Science fiction is the literature
of change. It should be the last genre to fear its own evolution.

                              — Margaret Chen
                                 San Francisco, California

Ms. Chen, we are not swayed. Thank you.                        — D.F.

FLOWERS FOR ALGERNON by Daniel Keyes
(Harcourt, Brace & World, 1966, $4.95)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Keyes has expanded his celebrated short story into a full novel, and
the result is one of the most emotionally devastating works of science
fiction I have ever read. Charlie Gordon, a mentally disabled man whose
intelligence is dramatically increased by an experimental procedure, and
who must then watch that intelligence fade, is one of the great tragic
figures in the genre. The novel's epistolary format — told through
Charlie's own progress reports — is a stroke of structural genius that
allows the reader to experience the arc of his transformation from the
inside. This is a book about intelligence, about what we mean by it, and
about the cruelty of a society that measures human worth by cognitive
ability. It is also, in its quiet way, a book about love. Essential.
Highest recommendation.

THE MOON IS A HARSH MISTRESS by Robert A. Heinlein
(G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1966, $5.95)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Heinlein's latest novel is a rousing, intellectually stimulating
tale of revolution on the Moon, told in a distinctive first-person argot
that takes some getting used to but ultimately proves irresistible. The
narrator, Manuel Garcia O'Kelly, is a computer technician who discovers
that the Moon's central computer has become sentient, and together they
lead a revolution against Earth's colonial authority. The political
philosophy is provocative — Mr. Heinlein's libertarianism is on full
display — and the technical details of lunar revolution are worked out
with characteristic Heinleinian thoroughness. Whether you agree with its
politics or not, this is a masterful piece of storytelling by one of the
genre's great practitioners. Highly recommended.

BABEL-17 by Samuel R. Delany
(Ace Books, 1966, $0.40)

Reviewed by Diana Foxworth

Mr. Delany, at twenty-four years old, has written a novel that would be
remarkable for a writer of any age. "Babel-17" is a story about
language — about an alien language that literally reshapes the thought
processes of anyone who learns it — and it is written with a linguistic
and structural sophistication that marks Mr. Delany as one of the most
exciting new voices in the genre. The prose is dense, inventive, and
sometimes dazzling. The ideas are ambitious. The execution is not always
perfect — the novel's action-adventure elements sit somewhat uneasily
alongside its linguistic philosophy — but the ambition and the talent are
unmistakable. Mr. Delany is a writer to watch. Recommended.

We are pleased to announce the contents of our next issue, which will be
available in late October:

"THE RESONANCE WINDOW" by Dr. Vincent Koslov — A deep-space observatory

million years ago. The signal is not a message. It is a question. And
Koslov's protagonist must decide whether humanity is ready to answer it.

of an expanding empire, and a diplomat must navigate the impossible space
between incompatible concepts of sovereignty. Voss at her most subtle
and her most devastating.

"THE SALVAGE KING" by Rex Drummond — Captain Jake Rennick takes on a
contract to recover a derelict warship from the rings of Saturn. The
contract is too good. The ship is too quiet. And Rennick is too stubborn
to walk away. Drummond in peak form.

"INHERITANCE TAX" by Oscar Lennox — A woman discovers that she has
inherited property in a parallel timeline, and the legal dispute that
follows calls into question the nature of ownership, identity, and the
relationship between the self and its alternatives.

our readers, book reviews, and more.
