TRANSMISSIONS FROM THE EDITOR'S DESK
by Maxwell Sterling

Dear Reader,

Summer is here, and I intend to keep you indoors.

That is not, I confess, the conventional purpose of a June issue. The
magazines at the newsstand next to ours — the ones with the fishing tips
and the barbecue recipes and the smiling families on motorboats — exist to
propel you into the sunshine. We at Tales from the Future and Beyond have a
different ambition. We want you on the porch, yes, but with your nose in
these pages and your mind several hundred thousand miles away, and we have
assembled seven stories calculated to make the hamburgers burn, the lawn
go unmowed, and the family vacation depart without you.

This is our second Summer Spectacular, and I believe it surpasses the first.

We open with Colonel James "Buck" Stanton's "Thunder Over Tranquility," a
taut, pressure-cooker thriller set on the Moon. Stanton writes military
fiction the way he flew combat missions — with precision, urgency, and an
unwavering awareness that real people die when the machinery fails. Major
Hank Dalton's forty-eight-hour race against catastrophe is the most
gripping story this magazine has published since Drummond's "Doublecross
on Deimos" in our very first issue, and I do not make the comparison
lightly.

Cordell Beaumont follows with a journey to the legendary gardens of
Procyon IV, where beauty is a weapon and pleasure is a trap. If you have
ever wondered what it would feel like to be seduced by a landscape,
Beaumont will show you — and make you grateful that your own garden is
merely ornamental.

Phyllis Crenshaw serves up temporal mischief in "The Time Traveler's
Cookbook," a story that begins as comedy and ends as something considerably
more unsettling. Theodore Cain delivers a tense salvage thriller with a
sting in its tail. Douglas Pemberton gives us an equation with an appetite
and the poor mathematician who wrote it. Bob Finley takes us racing on
the solar wind with a crew that must ride the most dangerous wave in the
system or die trying. And Lucian Marsh closes the issue with a story about
an alien cemetery where the dead are growing, and the fruit they bear is
not meant for human consumption.

Seven stories. Seven reasons to let the summer pass without you.

I promise you will not regret a single sunburn you fail to receive.

Yours among the stars,

Maxwell Sterling
Editor, Tales from the Future and Beyond
New York, April 1954

                      THUNDER OVER TRANQUILITY

                  by Col. James "Buck" Stanton

================================================================================

                               I.

The water recycling plant at Tranquility Base blew at 0347 hours, and
Major Hank Dalton was pulling on his boots before the klaxon finished its
first cycle.

He had learned to dress in the dark during Korea. Boots, trousers, shirt,
all in the right order, hands moving from muscle memory while his brain
caught up. The difference was that in Korea the floor had been frozen mud.
Here it was lunar steel, cold enough to bite through his socks, and the
gravity was wrong — one-sixth Earth, which meant everything took longer to
fall but hit just as hard when it did.

"Report," he said into the comm unit clipped to his collar.

"Sir, Recycler Three is gone." The voice belonged to Sergeant Elena Ruiz,
his senior NCO, and the fact that she was already on the line told him
she'd been awake. Ruiz was always awake. He'd never figured out when she
slept. "Complete structural failure. Pressure breach in the eastern
processing wing. Automatic seals engaged, but we lost atmosphere in
sections fourteen through seventeen."

"Casualties?"

"Two confirmed dead, seven injured. Medics are on it."

Dalton sealed his collar ring and stepped into the corridor. The emergency
lighting painted everything in strips of amber and shadow. Personnel moved
in both directions — some toward the blast site, some away from it — with
the controlled urgency of people trained for exactly this kind of thing.

"Cause?"

"Unknown. Could be mechanical failure. Could be —"

"Could be sabotage."

The word hung in the air like exhaled breath in a cold room. Everyone had
been thinking it. Nobody wanted to say it. The cold war between Earth and
its Lunar colonies had been getting worse for months — tariff disputes,
immigration freezes, the UN resolution that the colonists called the
Dependency Act and Earth called the Mutual Responsibility Framework. Words
on paper, mostly. Diplomatic maneuvers. Nothing that should have led to a
bomb in a water plant.

But here they were.

"Get me Colonel Vasquez," Dalton said. "And get me the plant schematics.
I want to know exactly what we lost."

"Yes, sir."

He walked fast, not quite running. Running in lunar gravity was an
invitation to bounce off the ceiling, and he'd seen enough new transfers
crack their skulls to know better. The corridor curved gently — Tranquility
Base was built in concentric rings, like the cross-section of a tree —
and he passed through three pressure doors, each one cycling green as his
badge triggered the sensors.

The base held ten thousand people. Miners, engineers, technicians,
administrators, families. A city under glass and regolith, dug into the
Mare Tranquillitatis with twenty years of tunneling and sweat. They grew
food in hydroponic bays, manufactured breathing air from lunar ice, and
recycled every drop of water through a system of three processing plants
that kept the whole operation alive.

One of those plants was now a hole in the ground.

Dalton reached the command center, a windowless room at the hub of the
base that smelled of coffee, sweat, and the particular ozone tang that
meant someone had been running the backup generators. Colonel Maria
Vasquez stood at the central table, studying a holographic projection of
the base layout. She was a small woman with iron-gray hair and the kind
of calm that came from having already survived the worst thing she could
imagine.

"Major," she said. "Come look at this."

He looked. The projection showed Recycler Three as a red void in the
eastern quadrant. The surrounding sections pulsed yellow — compromised but
holding. The other two recyclers glowed steady green.

"Can the remaining two plants handle the full load?"

"For a while," Vasquez said. "Chief Engineer Okonkwo is running the
numbers. Initial estimate is that Recyclers One and Two can sustain the
population at sixty percent normal water ration for approximately forty-
eight hours before the backup reservoirs run dry."

Forty-eight hours. Two days.

"After that?"

"After that, we start losing people."

Dalton studied the projection. Ten thousand colonists. Forty-eight hours
of water. And somewhere in this base, possibly, the person who had done
this.

"I need to see the wreckage," he said.


                               II.

The wreckage told a story, and it was not the story of mechanical failure.

Dalton stood at the edge of the blast zone in a pressure suit, boots
crunching on shattered composite. The eastern processing wing of Recycler
Three was open to vacuum now — the emergency seals had closed upstream,
but the wing itself was gone, peeled open like a tin can hit with a
sledgehammer. Through the breach, he could see the lunar surface: gray
regolith, black sky, the blue-white marble of Earth hanging at the horizon
like a lantern in a window.

Chief Engineer Adaeze Okonkwo walked him through it. She was a tall Igbo
woman from Lagos who had come to the Moon eight years ago and never gone
back. She knew every pipe, valve, and gasket in the recycling system the
way a surgeon knows the anatomy of the human heart.

"Shaped charge," she said, pointing to the fracture pattern on the main
processing tank. "See how the metal peeled outward here and here? That's
directional force. A mechanical failure — a pressure buildup, a faulty
weld — would have blown uniformly. This was targeted."

"At what specifically?"

"The primary membrane assembly. The thing that actually separates clean
water from waste. Without it, the whole plant is just a collection of
tanks and pipes." She paused. "Whoever did this knew exactly where to
place the charge to do maximum damage with minimum explosive. That's not
amateur work."

Dalton looked at the wreckage. Shards of processing membrane floated
slowly in the vacuum, catching the light like snowflakes. Two people had
died here. Technician First Class Yuri Petrov and Water Systems Specialist
Jennifer Huang. They'd been on the night shift, running standard
maintenance checks, and the bomb had turned them into casualties of a war
that nobody had officially declared.

"Can you rebuild it?"

Okonkwo's expression answered before her words did. "The membrane assembly
is custom-manufactured. We have spare components for routine maintenance,
but the core membranes are fabricated on Earth. Lead time for replacement
is six months minimum."

"We don't have six months. We have forty-eight hours."

"I'm aware of that, Major." She pulled up her tablet and showed him a
schematic. "There is one option. Recycler Three's membrane is destroyed,
but the structural housing is intact in the secondary wing. If I can
fabricate a temporary membrane from the polymer stock in the materials lab,
I can get the secondary wing operational. It won't be full capacity — maybe
thirty percent — but combined with the other two plants, it should be
enough to sustain the population indefinitely."

"How long to fabricate?"

"Forty hours, working around the clock."

"That gives us eight hours of margin."

"Yes. If nothing else goes wrong."

Dalton looked at the blue Earth on the horizon. Eight hours of margin
against the death of ten thousand people. He'd operated on thinner margins
in Korea, but not by much.

"Start fabrication," he said. "I'll get you whatever you need."


                              III.

The investigation started where every investigation starts: with a list.

Dalton set up in a borrowed office near the command center, a small room
with a desk, a chair, and a window that looked out on the hydroponic bay —
rows of green stretching to the curve of the ceiling, incongruously alive
in a place that was trying very hard to die. He liked the view. It
reminded him what he was fighting for.

Sergeant Ruiz brought him the personnel files. All ten thousand of them,
sorted by access. Not everyone on the base could have planted the bomb.
The recycler wing had restricted access — you needed a maintenance
clearance badge, and those were tracked. Dalton's first cut reduced the
suspect list to four hundred and twelve.

Still too many.

"Cross-reference with anyone who's arrived from Earth in the last six
months," he told Ruiz.

"That narrows it to eighty-seven."

"Cross-reference with anyone who has technical training in demolitions or
structural engineering."

"Fourteen."

Fourteen names. Fourteen people with the access, the expertise, and the
recent arrival from Earth that might indicate a connection to whoever was
running this operation from the other end.

"I want interviews with all fourteen. Start with the ones who were on
shift in the twelve hours before the blast."

Ruiz hesitated. It was a tiny hesitation — a half-second delay before
she said "Yes, sir" — but Dalton caught it.

"What?"

"One of the fourteen is Lieutenant Chen."

Lieutenant David Chen. Dalton's own logistics officer. A quiet, competent
young man who had transferred up from Earthside six months ago and done
solid work ever since. Dalton liked him. He was efficient, organized, and
never complained about the assignments that made other junior officers
grumble.

"Interview him with the others."

"Sir, if it's him —"

"If it's him, I need to know. If it isn't him, I need to clear him so I
can use him. Either way, interview him."

"Yes, sir."

The interviews began. Dalton conducted them himself, one at a time, in
the borrowed office with the green view. He'd learned interrogation
techniques in military intelligence school, but he'd learned more from
twenty years of watching people lie: the way they held their hands, the
direction their eyes moved, the pitch of their voice when they were
constructing a story versus recalling one.

Most of the fourteen were exactly what they appeared to be: specialists
who had transferred to the Moon for career advancement and had no interest
in blowing up the place they lived. They were frightened, cooperative,
and angry. Two of them cried. One demanded a lawyer, which was technically
his right under the Colonial Charter, but Dalton noted the demand and
moved on.

By the end of the first round, he had narrowed the list to three.

Technician Second Class Marcus Webb. Age thirty-one. Former combat
engineer in the Army, discharged two years ago, hired as a civilian
contractor by the Lunar Mining Authority six months ago. He had the
skills. He had the access. And he had a gap in his service record that
Dalton's database couldn't explain.

Dr. Sophia Laval. Age forty-four. Structural engineer on loan from the
European Space Consortium. She'd been on the Moon for four months and
had unrestricted access to the recycler wing for her inspection work. She
was cooperative during the interview but vague about her movements on
the night of the blast.

And Lieutenant David Chen.


                               IV.

The clock was running, and the base was starting to feel it.

Water rationing hit at 0800, twelve hours after the blast. The announcement
went out over the base intercom in Colonel Vasquez's steady voice: sixty
percent ration effective immediately, all non-essential water usage
suspended. Showers limited to two minutes. Laundry operations halted.
Hydroponic bays shifted to emergency irrigation protocols.

People handled it the way people always handle rationing — with
complaints, black humor, and the stubborn practicality of individuals who
have chosen to live in a place that is trying to kill them. The miners
went back to their shifts with water bottles half-full. The families in
the residential ring organized a water-sharing cooperative. The children,
who understood the danger better than their parents wanted to admit,
stopped asking for seconds.

Dalton spent the morning running down leads. Webb's service record gap
turned out to be a clerical error — he'd been on a classified demolitions
project for the Army, and the records had been improperly redacted rather
than legitimately sealed. The Army liaison on Earth confirmed his clearance
and his service within two hours. Webb had the skills to build the bomb,
but the Army vouched for him, and his alibi for the night of the blast
was solid: he'd been playing poker in the recreation bay with six
witnesses until 0200, then gone to his bunk.

Laval was harder to clear. The European Consortium was slow to respond to
Dalton's inquiries — time zones, bureaucracy, and the twelve-second
communications delay between Earth and Moon made every exchange feel like
shouting across a canyon. Her credentials checked out, but her movements
on the night of the blast remained unaccounted for between 0100 and 0400.
She said she'd been sleeping. She lived alone in a single-occupancy
quarter. No witnesses.

Chen was hardest of all. Not because the evidence pointed at him, but
because the absence of evidence was itself suspicious. His record was
clean — spotlessly, unnervingly clean. Every transfer form filed on time.
Every evaluation positive. Every duty log complete. In Dalton's experience,
real people left messy records. It was the fabricated identities that were
perfect.

He pulled Chen's original application to the Lunar service. Born in
Seattle. Graduated from the University of Washington with a degree in
logistics management. ROTC commission. Two years at a supply depot in
Kansas before requesting the Lunar transfer.

All verifiable. All correct.

All, Dalton suspected, perfectly constructed.


                               V.

At hour twenty-four, Okonkwo reported that the membrane fabrication was
on schedule. At hour twenty-six, she reported a problem.

"The polymer stock is contaminated," she told Dalton, standing in the
materials lab with grease on her hands and fury in her eyes. "Someone
introduced a catalytic agent into the storage vats. The polymer is still
usable, but its filtration tolerance is reduced. The membrane I build from
this stock will work, but it'll degrade faster — weeks instead of months."

"Can you compensate?"

"I can add a secondary filtration stage. It'll take longer. Maybe an
additional six hours."

Six hours they didn't have.

"Do it," Dalton said. "I'll find you the time."

He found the time by ordering Vasquez to cut the ration to forty percent.
It was a hard call. Forty percent meant people would start getting
dehydrated — headaches, fatigue, reduced cognitive function. In an
emergency environment where everyone needed to think clearly, it was the
opposite of what you wanted.

But it bought six hours.

The contamination of the polymer stock changed the calculation. This
wasn't a single act of sabotage. The bomber was still active, still on
the base, still trying to kill ten thousand people. And the polymer
contamination required different access than the recycler wing — it
required access to the materials lab, which had its own badge system.

Dalton pulled the materials lab access logs. Cross-referenced them with
his three suspects.

Webb had never entered the materials lab. Cleared.

Laval had entered the materials lab twice in the past month — both times
logged and explained as part of her structural inspection work.

Chen had entered the materials lab once, four days ago. His log entry
read: "Inventory verification — polymer stock audit."

It was a legitimate task for a logistics officer. It was exactly the kind
of mundane duty that would attract no attention. And it had given him
unsupervised access to the polymer storage vats.

Dalton stared at the log entry. It wasn't proof. A good defense attorney
would rip it apart in thirty seconds. But Dalton wasn't building a court
case. He was trying to stop a saboteur from destroying a colony.

He called Ruiz.

"Bring Lieutenant Chen to my office. Quietly."


                               VI.

Chen sat in the chair across from Dalton's desk with his hands folded in
his lap and his face perfectly composed. He was a good-looking young man —
clean-cut, square-jawed, the kind of face that recruiting posters were
made from. He met Dalton's eyes without flinching.

"You know why you're here," Dalton said.

"I assume it's about the recycler."

"It's about the recycler. And the polymer contamination."

A flicker. Just a flicker — a tightening at the corners of Chen's eyes
that lasted a tenth of a second. But Dalton saw it. In twenty years of
reading people, he'd learned that the face always told the truth for a
fraction of a second before the mask went back on.

"I don't know what you mean, sir."

"Lieutenant, I've been investigating sabotage incidents since before you
were born. I'm going to make you an offer. You can tell me what you know,
right now, in this room, and I'll do everything in my power to see that
you're treated fairly. Or you can stonewall me, and I'll lock this base
down so tight that a cockroach couldn't move without my knowing it, and
when I find the evidence — and I will find it — the treatment will be
considerably less fair."

Chen said nothing. His hands stayed folded. His expression didn't change.

"Let me tell you what I think happened," Dalton continued. "I think you
were recruited on Earth. I think someone — maybe military intelligence,
maybe a private contractor, maybe someone in the UN — approached you and
told you that the Lunar colonies were a threat to Earth's security. That
the colonists were stockpiling resources, building independent capacity,
preparing to break away. And I think they asked you to come up here and
make sure that didn't happen."

Still nothing.

"I think you planted the shaped charge in Recycler Three. I think you
contaminated the polymer stock as a backup in case the primary sabotage
wasn't enough. And I think there's a third action planned — something to
finish the job if the first two fail."

Chen's eyes moved. Just a fraction. Toward the door.

"There are two Marines outside that door," Dalton said. "You're not
leaving this room until I say so."

Silence. The clock on the wall ticked. Somewhere in the base, ten thousand
people were rationing their water and trusting that someone was handling
the crisis. Dalton could hear the ventilation system humming — the sound
of air being circulated, recycled, kept alive by machines that worked only
as long as someone maintained them.

Chen spoke. "You don't understand what's happening, Major."

"Then explain it to me."

"The colonies can't be allowed to become self-sufficient. If they do — if
they can manufacture their own food, their own water, their own air
without depending on Earth — there's nothing to stop them from declaring
independence. And an independent Lunar colony with access to helium-3
mining would shift the balance of power permanently."

"So your solution is to murder ten thousand civilians."

"My solution was to create a crisis that would demonstrate the colonies'
vulnerability. Force a renegotiation of the dependency framework. No one
was supposed to die."

Dalton's jaw tightened. The two technicians who had been running their
maintenance checks at 0347 hours — Petrov and Huang — would have disagreed.

"What's the third action?"

Chen hesitated.

"Lieutenant. What is the third action?"

"Recycler One. There's a second charge. Timed for —" He looked at the
clock. "Thirty-six hours from the initial blast. That's —"

Dalton was already calculating. "Four hours from now."

"If Recycler One goes down, the base is finished. One plant can't sustain
ten thousand people, even at minimum ration."

Dalton was on his feet and moving. "Ruiz! Get a bomb disposal team to
Recycler One. Now. Full sweep, every pipe, every junction, every
maintenance panel. Move!"

He turned back to Chen. "Where exactly?"

"The intake manifold. Same placement as the first charge — directional,
aimed at the membrane assembly."

"How is it triggered?"

"Timer. Electronic. Hardwired — no remote detonation."

Dalton grabbed the comm unit. "Okonkwo, this is Dalton. There's an
explosive device in Recycler One, intake manifold, near the membrane
assembly. Timer-triggered, electronic, hardwired. I need your people to
find it and disable it. You have four hours."

Okonkwo's voice came back, tight and controlled. "Understood."

Dalton looked at Chen one more time. The young man sat in his chair,
hands still folded, and for a moment Dalton saw something that might
have been relief on his face — the look of a man who had been carrying
a weight he could no longer bear.

"Marines," Dalton called. "Take Lieutenant Chen into custody. Confine him
to the brig, full security protocols. No communications."

The Marines came in, and Chen stood without being told. He didn't resist.
At the door, he paused and looked back.

"For what it's worth, Major, I'm sorry about Petrov and Huang."

Dalton said nothing. There was nothing to say that would help.


                              VII.

The bomb disposal team found the charge exactly where Chen said it would
be. It was a neat, professional device — shaped C-4 equivalent, electronic
timer, wired directly to a detonator embedded in the casing of the intake
manifold. The timer showed three hours and forty-two minutes remaining.

Specialist Rivera, the base's only trained explosive ordnance disposal
technician, disarmed it in eleven minutes. She emerged from the recycler
wing carrying the device in a containment case, her hands steady and her
face sheened with sweat.

"Clean removal," she reported. "No secondary devices detected."

Dalton nodded. "Sweep the entire base. Every recycler, every critical
system. I want confirmation that there are no additional surprises."

"Yes, sir."

The sweep took twelve hours and found nothing. Chen had told the truth —
three actions, no more. The bomb, the contamination, and the second bomb.
A carefully escalated campaign designed to create maximum pressure without,
in theory, killing anyone.

Theory had failed, as it usually did when it met the real world.


                             VIII.

At hour forty, Okonkwo completed the temporary membrane and installed it
in Recycler Three's secondary wing. The system came online at 1947 hours
— dirty, improvised, and running at twenty-eight percent capacity instead
of the projected thirty. Combined with the other two plants, it was
enough.

The water ration went back to sixty percent, then seventy, then — two
days later — full. The headaches faded. The hydroponic bays went back to
normal irrigation. The children got their seconds.

Colonel Vasquez held a base-wide assembly in the main auditorium, standing
on the stage in front of ten thousand exhausted, relieved, angry people,
and told them the truth: that the sabotage had been an act of political
terrorism, that the perpetrator was in custody, and that Earth would be
informed.

She did not tell them everything. She did not tell them that Chen had been
an agent of their own government — that the nation that claimed sovereignty
over the Moon had tried to cripple the colony it was supposed to protect.
That would come out later, in hearings and investigations and the
diplomatic firestorm that Dalton could already see gathering on the
horizon.

For now, the water was running, and the people were alive, and that was
enough.

Dalton stood at the back of the auditorium and watched the assembly.
Ruiz stood next to him, arms crossed, her face unreadable.

"Think this changes anything?" she asked.

"It changes everything," Dalton said. "They tried to make the colonies
dependent by breaking the thing that made us independent. It didn't work.
Okonkwo built a new membrane from scratch in forty hours. The colonists
rationed their water and didn't panic. The children shared."

He paused.

"They wanted to prove we can't survive without Earth. Instead, they
proved we can."

Ruiz looked at him. "That's going to scare them even more."

"Yes," Dalton said. "It is."

He looked through the auditorium window at the lunar surface, where
Earth hung blue and distant on the horizon. The cold war wasn't over.
If anything, it was about to get worse. The people who had sent Chen
would try again — different methods, different agents, different targets.
And the colonists would have to be ready.

But today, the water was running. The base was whole. Two people were
dead, and one man was in the brig, and the machinery that kept ten
thousand people alive was humming in the walls like a heartbeat.

Major Hank Dalton stood at the back of the room and watched his people,
and for the first time in forty-eight hours, he did not calculate how
long they had left to live.

It was enough.

                  THE PLEASURE GARDENS OF PROCYON

                        by Cordell Beaumont

================================================================================

                               I.

The first thing you noticed about the gardens of Procyon IV was the color.
Not a single color — no world of any sophistication limits itself to one
palette — but rather the sheer profligacy of it, the reckless, drunken
abundance with which the gardens hurled pigment at the eye. Vermillion
bleeding into amber. Cobalt dissolving into jade. Colors that had no name
in any human language, colors that existed in the margins between violet
and infrared, colors that you could taste on the back of your tongue like
the ghost of a flavor you had never quite encountered.

Gabriel Leconte stood at the viewport of the pleasure cruiser *Elysia*
and pressed his forehead against the glass and felt, for the first time
in his forty-seven years of careful, insured, risk-averse existence, the
stirring of something he could only describe as hunger.

"My God," whispered Mrs. Nettleworth beside him, her lorgnette trembling
at her nose. "It's like a Monet on fire."

It was nothing like a Monet on fire. Monet had been constrained by the
visible spectrum, by linseed oil and horsehair brushes, by the limitations
of a human hand and a human eye. The gardens of Procyon IV operated under
no such restrictions. They were, according to the brochure that Gabriel
had read seventeen times during the three-month voyage, the most beautiful
place in the known galaxy — a living landscape cultivated over ten thousand
years by the Procyoni, a species whose entire civilization was organized
around the production of aesthetic pleasure. Visitors came from a dozen
worlds. The waiting list was measured in decades.

Gabriel had booked his passage two years ago, after the divorce, after the
breakdown, after Dr. Pettigrew had suggested — in that careful, therapeutic
way of his — that perhaps what Gabriel needed was not another medication
adjustment but an experience of genuine beauty. "Go somewhere
extraordinary," Pettigrew had said. "Go somewhere that reminds you what
it feels like to want to be alive."

And so here he was, descending toward the most beautiful place in the
universe, and the hunger in his chest was opening like a flower, and for
the first time in years he was not thinking about dying.


                               II.

The *Elysia* carried forty-three passengers, all human, all wealthy enough
to afford the fare, and all — Gabriel was beginning to realize — running
from something. Mrs. Nettleworth from her fourth husband. Professor Crane
from his academic disgrace. The Delacroix twins from a scandal involving
a forged Cézanne and an insurance company. Young Miss Takahashi from a
grief she did not name but wore like a second skin, visible in the way
she stood at windows and looked at nothing.

The landing was gentle — the Procyoni had built their spaceport the way
they built everything, as an extension of the garden itself. The pad was
a vast disc of polished obsidian, and the moment the *Elysia's* doors
opened, the air came in.

Gabriel had read about the air. The brochure called it "the first
pleasure" and described it in language that he had dismissed as marketing
hyperbole. He now understood that the brochure had been, if anything,
understating the case.

The air of Procyon IV smelled of jasmine and thunderstorms. It smelled of
woodsmoke and caramel and the salt tang of an ocean Gabriel had never
seen. It smelled of his mother's kitchen on a winter morning and of the
perfume Marie-Claire had worn on their first date and of rain falling
on hot stone in a city he had visited only in dreams. The scents layered
and shifted, each one triggering a memory so precise and so personal that
Gabriel understood, with a lurch of vertigo, that the air was reading
him — sampling his biochemistry, his pheromones, his neural responses —
and composing a fragrance tailored to the exact architecture of his
longing.

"Oh," said Mrs. Nettleworth, and sat down on the gangway steps and wept.

Their guide was waiting at the edge of the pad. She was Procyoni — tall,
slender, with skin the color of copper patina and eyes that shifted from
gold to violet in the changing light. She wore a garment that appeared
to be woven from living flowers, petals opening and closing in slow
rhythm against her body, releasing tiny puffs of perfume with each
movement.

"I am Vessel-of-Welcoming," she said, in perfectly accented English that
carried an undertone of music, as if each word were accompanied by a
note played on an instrument Gabriel could not identify. "You are our
guests. The gardens have been preparing for your arrival."

"Preparing?" Professor Crane asked, adjusting his spectacles with the
nervous energy of a man who categorized the world as a defense against
it.

"The gardens are alive," Vessel said. "They sense each visitor. They
learn what you desire, what you lack, what you have lost. And they grow
to fill the absence."

She led them down a path of translucent stone that glowed faintly from
within, each footstep producing a soft chime that harmonized with the
steps before and after, so that the group's passage down the path became
an unrehearsed music that was, somehow, lovely. The path wound through
a grove of trees whose trunks were braided columns of living crystal,
refracting the amber light of Procyon into cascading rainbows that
moved like schools of fish through the undergrowth.

Gabriel walked in a daze of sensation. Every step revealed a new wonder.
A pond whose surface displayed scenes from the viewers' memories, rippling
gently so that the images blurred and reformed like half-forgotten dreams.
A bower of vines that produced fruit shaped like tiny harps, each one
playing a different melody when the wind moved through them. A clearing
where the grass was so soft, so perfectly temperate, so precisely the
right shade of green, that lying in it felt like being held by the earth
itself.

He lay in that grass for what might have been an hour, staring up at
the canopy of crystal trees and the amber sky beyond, and the hunger in
his chest softened into something warmer and quieter, and he thought:
I could stay here forever.

That, he would later understand, was the trap.


                              III.

The first sign of trouble came on the third day, when Professor Crane
tried to leave.

Not the gardens — just the immediate area. He had been assigned a personal
garden, as had each of the visitors: a space cultivated specifically for
him, grown from the gardens' reading of his biochemistry and psychology,
a living environment shaped to his exact emotional needs. Crane's garden
was a recreation of an idealized Oxford college — honey-colored stone
walls draped in climbing roses, a manicured lawn, a library filled with
books that had not yet been written, containing ideas that Crane had been
unable to articulate.

He wanted to visit the central plaza, where the Procyoni had their
markets. Vessel-of-Welcoming discouraged this.

"The gardens have prepared your space," she said, with the gentle firmness
of a nurse addressing a patient who wishes to leave his bed too soon.
"It is not yet complete. If you leave before the gardens have finished
their work, the therapeutic effect will be compromised."

"Therapeutic effect?" Crane said. "I'm not here for therapy. I'm here as
a tourist."

Vessel smiled. It was a beautiful smile, and it communicated absolutely
nothing. "All visitors are guests. All guests are tended."

Crane left anyway. He walked to the edge of his personal garden, stepped
through the hedge that bordered it, and found himself on a path that
curved gently back the way he had come. He tried again. The path curved
again. He tried a third time, walking in a straight line and marking his
progress by scratching notches in the translucent stone, and discovered
that after two hundred paces, the notches began repeating.

The path was a loop.

He returned to his garden, shaken, and reported his experience to
Gabriel over dinner. They ate in the communal hall, a structure grown
from a single enormous flower, its petals forming walls and ceiling,
its stamens producing a warm golden light. The food was extraordinary —
each dish calibrated, like the air, to the individual diner's deepest
preferences — and Gabriel had to force himself to pay attention to Crane's
words rather than the flavors dissolving on his tongue.

"The paths are recursive," Crane said, pushing his plate away with
visible effort. "They loop. I can't find a route out of the garden zone."

"Why would you want to?" This was Mrs. Nettleworth, who had spent the
past three days in a state of euphoria so continuous that Gabriel found
it alarming. "It's paradise here. The food, the air, the flowers — I've
never been happier."

"That's precisely the problem," Crane said. "Happiness should not be
this easy."

Gabriel said nothing. He was watching Miss Takahashi across the hall. She
sat alone, as she always sat, but her posture had changed. On the ship,
she had carried herself like someone braced for a blow. Here, she had
softened — her shoulders dropped, her face relaxed, her eyes focused on
the middle distance with an expression that hovered between contentment
and surrender.

He understood the expression. He was beginning to feel it himself.


                               IV.

On the fifth day, Gabriel made his own attempt to leave the gardens.

Not because he wanted to — he emphatically did not want to — but because
he recognized the shape of what was happening to him. He had spent two
years in Dr. Pettigrew's office learning to identify the mechanisms of
his own depression, and he knew that the opposite of depression was not
happiness. The opposite of depression was engagement — the difficult,
uncomfortable, sometimes painful process of participating in a world
that did not owe you anything. What the gardens offered was not the
opposite of depression. It was its mirror image: a numbness wrapped in
pleasure, a withdrawal disguised as arrival.

He walked to the edge of his personal garden — a recreation of a
Provençal farmhouse he had visited once on his honeymoon, with lavender
fields that stretched to a horizon that smelled of Marie-Claire's hair —
and found the recursive path that Crane had described. It curved. It
looped. It brought him back.

He tried a different approach. He did not walk. He sat at the border of
his garden and waited, and watched.

The garden watched back.

He could feel it — a gentle, pervasive attention, like being observed by
something very large and very patient. The flowers at the border turned
toward him, their petals adjusting to present their most beautiful angle.
The grass beneath him warmed. A breeze carried a scent — Marie-Claire
again, and underneath it, something older and deeper, a scent that went
straight to the limbic system and whispered *stay*.

"I want to speak to Vessel-of-Welcoming," Gabriel said aloud.

The flowers rustled. A path appeared — not the recursive loop, but a
new path, straight and narrow, leading through a thicket of crystal
ferns to a clearing Gabriel had not seen before.

Vessel was there, seated on a stone that appeared to grow from the ground
like a stool, tending a plant that Gabriel did not recognize. Its leaves
were translucent, veined with light, and they pulsed with a rhythm that
matched, he realized with a chill, his own heartbeat.

"You have questions," Vessel said.

"I have one question. Can we leave?"

Vessel continued tending the plant. Her fingers moved along its leaves
with the delicacy of a musician tuning an instrument. "Why would you wish
to leave?"

"Because I am beginning to suspect that we cannot."

Vessel looked at him. Her eyes shifted from gold to deep violet, the
change slow enough that Gabriel could track it, like watching a sunset
compressed into seconds.

"No visitor has ever left the gardens of Procyon," she said. "Not because
they are prevented. Because they choose to stay."

"And if someone chose differently?"

"No one chooses differently. The gardens understand you better than you
understand yourself. They provide what you need. What you truly need, not
what you think you need. Given that, why would anyone leave?"

Gabriel thought of Mrs. Nettleworth, weeping with joy at her first breath
of Procyoni air. Of Crane, pacing his illusory Oxford and slowly
forgetting to be frightened. Of Miss Takahashi, who had stopped looking
at nothing and started looking at the flowers, and whose grief was fading
day by day into something that resembled peace.

Of himself, lying in the grass and thinking: *I could stay here forever.*

"How many visitors are in the gardens right now?" he asked.

"You are the forty-seventh group. Approximately two thousand guests, from
twelve worlds, across the past three hundred years."

"Three hundred years? But the brochure said —"

"The brochure was written by previous visitors. They were very happy when
they wrote it."

Gabriel sat down. The stone beneath him was warm, and it contoured itself
to his body, and it was the most comfortable seat he had ever occupied,
and he hated it.

"You're a trap," he said. "The entire garden is a trap."

Vessel looked pained — genuinely pained, not performing pain — and her
flowers wilted slightly against her body. "We do not use that word. We
are a refuge. A sanctuary. The universe is vast and cold and often cruel,
and the beings who come to us are, without exception, hurt. We heal them."

"By keeping them forever."

"By giving them a place where they do not need to leave."

"That's not healing. That's anesthesia."

Vessel was silent for a long moment. The plant between them pulsed with
Gabriel's heartbeat, and he could feel the garden pressing against him
from all sides — not with walls or barriers but with comfort, with beauty,
with the gentle, relentless persuasion of a world that knew exactly what
he wanted and could provide it in unlimited supply.

"The pain you came here to escape," Vessel said quietly. "Would you truly
choose to return to it?"

Gabriel closed his eyes. He thought of his empty apartment. His
prescription bottles. The gray mornings and the long nights and the
feeling of being a ghost in his own life. He thought of Dr. Pettigrew
saying, "Go somewhere that reminds you what it feels like to want to be
alive."

He opened his eyes.

"Yes," he said. "I would."


                               V.

He could not save everyone. He knew that before he started, and it hurt,
but he had learned enough from Pettigrew to know that you could not
carry another person's healing on your back. You could only offer a hand
and hope they took it.

He found Crane in his illusory Oxford, reading a book that the garden
had grown specifically for him — a monograph on Elizabethan literature
that contained, Crane whispered reverently, ideas he had spent his entire
career trying to formulate. Gabriel told him the truth. Crane listened,
closed the book with shaking hands, and said, "I know. I've known since
the third day. But this book, Gabriel. This book."

"It's not real."

"It's real enough."

Gabriel left him there. He found the Delacroix twins in their personal
garden, which was a recreation of a Parisian salon, and they laughed in
his face. He found Mrs. Nettleworth in a garden that smelled of her
childhood, and she patted his hand and told him he was overthinking
things.

He found Miss Takahashi sitting beside a pond whose surface showed, in
rippling, half-focused images, the face of someone Gabriel did not
recognize — a young man, dark-haired, laughing, turning to look at
something out of frame.

"That's him," she said, without looking up. "Kenji. He died two years
ago. The gardens grew him for me." She paused. "Not him. An image of him.
But it's the best image I've ever seen."

"It's not him, Yuki."

"I know." She touched the water, and the image rippled and reformed. "I
know it's not him. But I can see him laugh. I can hear his voice. The
garden has recordings — it read my memories and reconstructed his voice,
and if I sit here at twilight, it plays me our last conversation. The
real one. The one I can't remember clearly anymore."

She looked at Gabriel, and her eyes were dry and clear and fully aware.
"I'm not staying because I'm fooled. I'm staying because the alternative
is a world where I can't hear his voice."

Gabriel sat beside her. The pond reflected them both — two people on the
edge of the most beautiful trap in the galaxy, looking at the face of
a dead man in the water.

"He would want you to leave," Gabriel said.

"You didn't know him."

"I know what love looks like when it wants the best for someone."

Miss Takahashi was quiet for a long time. The image in the pond laughed
silently, turned, reached out a hand that dissolved into ripples before
it could touch anything.

"If I leave," she said, "I lose his voice."

"If you stay, you lose yours."

She looked at the pond. She looked at Gabriel. She looked at the sky,
where the amber light of Procyon was fading into the deep indigo of
evening, and the crystal trees were beginning to glow with their own
internal luminescence, and the garden was settling into its most
seductive mode — the twilight hour, when every beauty was softened and
every longing sharpened.

"Alright," she said. "How do we get out?"


                               VI.

The answer was, as Gabriel suspected, simple — and that was what made
it hard.

Vessel-of-Welcoming had said it herself: no one was prevented from
leaving. They were persuaded to stay. The recursive paths, the tailored
pleasures, the air that smelled of everything you'd lost — these were not
walls. They were arguments. Brilliant, beautiful, almost irresistible
arguments for remaining in a place that gave you everything you wanted.

The way out was to want something the garden could not provide.

Gabriel had spent two years learning that lesson in Pettigrew's office.
Depression was a kind of garden — a closed loop of numbness and
withdrawal that felt, from the inside, like safety. The path out was
not to wait for the numbness to lift. It was to want something badly
enough to walk through it.

He wanted his life back. Not the good parts — those the garden could
replicate. The difficult parts. The mornings when getting out of bed
was an act of defiance. The evenings when loneliness sat in his chest
like a stone. The slow, unglamorous, imperfect work of building a life
that was his own and no one else's.

He walked to the edge of his garden, and the recursive path curved before
him, and he walked into it, and the lavender fields reached for him,
and Marie-Claire's scent wrapped around him like arms, and the garden
whispered *stay, stay, stay* with every flower and every breeze and every
note of every melody that the wind-harps played.

And he kept walking.

The path curved. He followed the curve. The path looped. He completed the
loop and kept going. The garden threw its finest weapons at him — a sunset
that made him weep, a birdsong that was his mother's lullaby, a taste
on the wind that was the first meal he and Marie-Claire had cooked
together in their tiny apartment in Lyon.

He kept walking.

Beside him, Miss Takahashi walked in silence, and he did not know what
the garden was showing her, but tears streamed down her face and she did
not stop.

The path straightened. The garden fell away. The colors dimmed from their
impossible profligacy to something merely beautiful, then merely pleasant,
then simply real. The air lost its tailored perfume and became what it
was: alien atmosphere, thin and sharp, with a mineral tang that had
nothing to do with memory and everything to do with the actual chemical
composition of an actual planet orbiting an actual star.

They emerged on the far side of the garden complex, on a plain of gray
stone under an amber sky, and the *Elysia* was there — still on its
landing pad, powered down but intact. The Procyoni had not touched it.
Why would they? No one ever came back for it.

Gabriel and Yuki stood on the stone and breathed the real air and looked
back at the gardens, which shimmered at the horizon like a mirage, all
color and light and promise.

"It's still beautiful," Yuki said.

"Yes," Gabriel said. "And we're still leaving."

They boarded the *Elysia*. Gabriel keyed the startup sequence — the
brochure had said the ship could be operated by a minimum crew of two,
and for once the brochure was telling the truth. The engines powered up.
The nav computer calculated the return trajectory. The landing pad fell
away beneath them, and the gardens shrank to a smear of color on the
planet's surface, and then to nothing.

In the copilot's seat, Yuki Takahashi stared out the viewport at the
diminishing world. "Do you think the others will ever leave?"

Gabriel thought of Crane with his impossible book. Of Mrs. Nettleworth
with her childhood. Of the two thousand guests from twelve worlds across
three hundred years, held not by chains but by the terrible, perfect
kindness of a garden that knew what they wanted better than they did.

"I don't know," he said. "I hope so."

The *Elysia* climbed into the dark, leaving the color behind, and the
stars were white and cold and not at all what Gabriel needed, and he was
glad.

                    THE TIME TRAVELER'S COOKBOOK

                        by Phyllis Crenshaw

================================================================================

                               I.

The book was called *Recipes Across Time: A Culinary Journey Through
Every Era of Human History*, and it was, by any reasonable measure, the
most successful cookbook ever published.

It appeared on the shelves of Scribner's bookstore on Fifth Avenue on a
Tuesday morning in March 1954, sandwiched between Julia Child's latest
and a pamphlet about Jell-O salads, and within six weeks it had sold
four hundred thousand copies, been reviewed in every major newspaper,
caused a fistfight at a dinner party hosted by the French ambassador, and
prompted three separate investigations by three separate government
agencies, none of which could agree on what crime, exactly, had been
committed.

The author's name was Dr. Emmeline Quist. Her photograph on the back
flap showed a woman of indeterminate age — she might have been thirty
or sixty, with the kind of face that seemed to exist slightly out of
focus, as though the camera had been unable to decide which version of
her to capture — wearing a linen apron and holding a wooden spoon with
the casual authority of a person who had stirred things in every century.

"I have collected these recipes personally," she wrote in the
introduction, "through visits to every major period of human culinary
history. I have eaten bread baked in the ovens of Pompeii the morning
before the eruption. I have tasted the banquet dishes of the Tang Dynasty
at their source. I have sampled frontier cooking on the Oregon Trail,
court cuisine at Versailles, and street food in twenty-third-century
Nairobi. Every recipe in this book is authentic, tested, and — I give
you my word — delicious."

Most people read this as a charming literary conceit. Dr. Quist was a
time traveler, ha ha, how delightful. The recipes were certainly
extraordinary — the Pompeian bread recipe alone, which used a specific
strain of wheat that food historians had believed extinct, was enough to
make serious bakers weep with joy. Her Tang Dynasty dumplings contained
a spice blend so precise that a professor of Chinese culinary history at
Yale wrote a ten-page letter to the publisher demanding to know her
sources.

But it was the anomalies that caught the attention of people who paid
closer attention.


                               II.

The first anomaly was noticed by Dr. Frances Hubbard, a food historian
at the University of Chicago, on page 47 of the cookbook.

The recipe was labeled "Sumerian Honey Cakes, circa 2100 BCE" and it
called for, among other ingredients, vanilla extract.

Vanilla. In Sumer.

Dr. Hubbard, who had spent twenty years studying ancient Mesopotamian
cuisine, nearly choked on her morning coffee. Vanilla was indigenous to
Mesoamerica. It had not been introduced to the Old World until the
Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the sixteenth century. The
Sumerians had never tasted vanilla, never smelled it, never heard of it.
It simply did not exist in their world.

She wrote a letter to the publisher, which was forwarded to Dr. Quist,
who replied with a note of such cheerful vagueness that Hubbard's blood
pressure rose ten points:

"Dear Dr. Hubbard, thank you for your careful reading! You are quite
correct that vanilla was not native to ancient Sumer. However, I can
assure you that the honey cakes I tasted in the market at Ur did, in
fact, contain vanilla. The vendor was a delightful old woman named
Nin-kisalsi who told me she had obtained the flavoring from a trader
who had traveled 'from the edge of the world.' I did not press her for
details, as one does not interrogate one's hostess about her spice
cabinet. I hope you enjoy the cakes regardless. They are quite good with
afternoon tea."

Hubbard did not find this satisfactory.


                              III.

The second anomaly appeared on page 112. A recipe for "Roman Garum,
First Century CE" — the ubiquitous fermented fish sauce of the ancient
Mediterranean — included, as a finishing ingredient, a tablespoon of
soy sauce.

Soy sauce. In Rome.

The third anomaly was on page 203. A medieval English recipe for
"Lombard Chicken, circa 1380" called for the use of chili peppers, which
would not arrive in Europe from the Americas for another hundred years.

The fourth was on page 267. A recipe attributed to "a roadside inn in
Han Dynasty China, circa 100 BCE" included tomatoes — a New World fruit
that would not reach Asia until the sixteenth century, at the earliest.

The pattern was unmistakable. In recipe after recipe, Dr. Quist's
"authentic" historical dishes contained ingredients that should not have
existed in the times and places she attributed them to. And the
ingredients were always the same kind: New World foods appearing in Old
World recipes centuries before Columbus, or Old World foods appearing in
New World recipes before contact.

Dr. Hubbard published a paper. The paper attracted the attention of
Dr. Quist's publisher, who asked Dr. Quist for a response. Dr. Quist's
response was a recipe for Aztec hot chocolate that included, inexplicably,
cardamom.


                               IV.

The government agencies became involved when a historian at the
Smithsonian noticed something more disturbing than misplaced ingredients.

Dr. Lewis Alcott was not a food historian. He was a cultural historian
specializing in the diffusion of agricultural technology, and when he
read Dr. Quist's cookbook, he did not focus on the recipes. He focused
on the notes.

Dr. Quist's recipes were accompanied by chatty, discursive annotations
describing the circumstances of their collection. She wrote about the
markets where she had shopped, the kitchens where she had cooked, the
conversations she had shared with hosts and vendors and fellow travelers.
These annotations were written with the specificity and sensory detail
of genuine travel writing — not the vague, impressionistic descriptions
of someone imagining a historical period, but the precise, particular
observations of someone who had actually been there.

And some of those observations did not match the historical record.

In her notes on a recipe from sixteenth-century Florence, she mentioned
in passing a type of pasta that food historians had believed was not
developed until the eighteenth century. In her account of a meal in
medieval Baghdad, she described a spice market that included ingredients
from sub-Saharan Africa that the historical record placed in Arabian
trade networks two hundred years later than her date. In a note about
a recipe from Heian-period Japan, she mentioned a ceramic technique
that was not documented until the Kamakura period.

These were not errors. They were too consistent, too specific, too
casually embedded in otherwise accurate descriptions. They read, Alcott
realized with growing unease, like the observations of someone who had
witnessed these things firsthand — and whose presence had altered what
she witnessed.

He wrote a classified memo to the State Department. The State Department
forwarded it to the CIA. The CIA forwarded it to a division whose name
Alcott was not cleared to know.

And then Dr. Quist's publisher received a visit from two men in gray
suits who asked, very politely, for Dr. Quist's home address.


                               V.

Dr. Quist's home address turned out to be a brownstone on West 74th
Street in Manhattan, and when the two men in gray suits arrived, they
found the front door open, the kitchen warm, and a note on the table
that read:

"Dear gentlemen — I suspected you would come. Please help yourselves
to the scones on the counter. The recipe is Edwardian, with a few
modifications. I have stepped out to attend to some errands and will
return shortly. By 'shortly' I mean that I was here five minutes ago and
will be here five minutes from now, but the five minutes in between may,
from your perspective, last somewhat longer than you expect. Do not be
alarmed. The scones are excellent."

The men in gray suits ate the scones. They were, by both accounts,
excellent.

Dr. Quist did not return that day, or the next, or the next. The
brownstone appeared to be a perfectly ordinary residence occupied by a
woman of scholarly habits and excellent taste in kitchen equipment. The
bookshelves contained cookbooks from every period and region, many of
them in languages the agents could not identify. The kitchen was
equipped with tools that ranged from a Roman mortarium to a copper
saucepan that bore the hallmark of a Parisian coppersmith who, according
to later research, had not yet been born.

In the study, they found a journal. Most of it was written in a script
that no linguist at the CIA could decipher, but several pages near the
end were in English, and these contained a passage that was later
classified at the highest level of secrecy:

"The paradox is not that I brought vanilla to Sumer. The paradox is that
Sumer already had vanilla when I arrived. The old woman in the market,
Nin-kisalsi, told me she had always used it. Her mother had used it. Her
grandmother had used it. She thought I was mad for asking where it came
from.

"I have been traveling long enough to understand what this means. The
recipes in my book are not anachronisms. They are evidence of a temporal
feedback loop. I brought the ingredients to the past because the past
already contained them because I had brought them. The cookbook is not a
record of history as it was. It is a record of history as I made it —
inadvertently, irrevocably, and with the best of culinary intentions.

"I publish the book anyway, because the recipes are good, and because
the alternative — attempting to undo what I have done — would require
removing vanilla from the memory of a woman who has been dead for four
thousand years, and that strikes me as rude."

The journal continued for several more pages, documenting Dr. Quist's
travels with the meticulous disorganization of a woman who kept notes
the way other people kept souvenirs — compulsively, affectionately, and
with no regard for chronological order. One entry, dated only "a
Thursday, I think, but whose Thursday is anyone's guess," described her
visit to a medieval English monastery where the monks were brewing a
beer that contained hops from three different centuries:

"Brother Anselm was most accommodating, though he did ask some pointed
questions about my clothing. I told him I was a pilgrim from a very
distant land, which was true in every sense except the spatial one. His
beer was magnificent — a dark, complex ale with undertones of honey and
something I eventually identified as coffee. Coffee! In twelfth-century
England! I nearly wept. Then I checked my travel log and realized that
I had introduced coffee beans to the monastery's herbalist on a
previous visit that I had not yet made. The loop is tightening.

"I am beginning to suspect that my travels are not merely affecting
the history of food. They are creating the history of food. Every
cuisine I document turns out to contain traces of my previous
interventions. The French court at Versailles uses spices I brought to
a Provençal market in the fourteenth century. The street vendors of
medieval Cairo sell pastries made with sugar I introduced to the region
two hundred years before the historical date of sugar's arrival. I am
not a historian. I am an ingredient.

"This would trouble me more if the food were not so extraordinarily
good."

Another entry described a visit to a future she had not yet published
in her cookbook:

"The cooking of the twenty-third century is both wonderful and
terrifying. They have ingredients we cannot imagine — synthesized
flavors, engineered proteins, fruits that grow in zero gravity with
structures no earthbound plant could achieve. But the most popular dish
in the cafeterias of Mars Colony Seven is, I was delighted to discover,
a variation on my Sumerian honey cakes, prepared from a recipe that has
been passed down, hand to hand, for forty-two centuries. The vanilla is
still there. Some things, it seems, transcend even time.

"The colonists on Mars asked where the recipe originated. I told them
it was very old. They asked how old. I said: older than you think. They
laughed and gave me seconds. I have always found that people who cook
well are disinclined to interrogate the history of a good recipe. They
care only that it works.

"There is a lesson in this, though I am not sure what it is."


                               VI.

Dr. Hubbard read the classified memo six months later, after she was
granted a security clearance she had neither requested nor understood,
and her reaction was — characteristically — professional outrage.

"Let me see if I follow," she said to the two men in gray suits who
sat across from her desk at the University of Chicago, neither of them
eating the scones she had baked from Dr. Quist's Edwardian recipe
(which were, she admitted privately, better than her own). "A time
traveler visited ancient Sumer and accidentally introduced vanilla to
the Mesopotamian spice trade. She then visited first-century Rome and
introduced soy sauce. She visited medieval England and introduced chili
peppers. She visited Han Dynasty China and introduced tomatoes."

"That appears to be the situation, Dr. Hubbard."

"And these introductions have become permanent features of the historical
record? Sumer has always had vanilla because she always brought it?"

"As far as we can determine, yes."

"Then every food history book I have ever written is wrong."

"We prefer to say that the historical record has been — revised."

Dr. Hubbard stared at them. She thought about her twenty years of
research, her six published books, her graduate students' dissertations.
She thought about the Sumerian honey cakes, which she had baked last
Tuesday and which had been, with the vanilla, incomparably better than
any reconstruction she had previously attempted.

"Does this mean," she asked slowly, "that spaghetti and tomato sauce
existed in ancient Rome?"

The men in gray suits exchanged a glance.

"Dr. Quist's journal contains a recipe for what she calls 'Marcus
Aurelius's favorite supper,'" one of them said. "It is, essentially,
pasta pomodoro."

Dr. Hubbard removed her glasses and set them on the desk and stared at
the wall for a long time.

"The woman is a menace," she said finally.

"Yes, ma'am."

"An absolute menace."

"Yes, ma'am."

"Those honey cakes, though." She put her glasses back on. "Those honey
cakes are extraordinary."

Dr. Emmeline Quist was never found, though her cookbook remained in print
and continued to sell briskly. The second edition, which appeared on
bookshelves six months after the first — delivered to the publisher by
mail, with a postmark from a city that did not exist — contained forty
new recipes and a revised introduction:

"Some readers have observed that certain ingredients in this book appear
in historical periods where they should not, strictly speaking, be found.
To these observant readers I say: you are correct. The history of food
is more complicated than any of us imagined, and the complication is, I
am afraid, partially my fault. I offer my sincerest apologies to the
food historians whose work I have inadvertently invalidated, and my
sincerest thanks to the ancient cooks whose recipes I have accidentally
improved.

"To those who ask whether I have changed history: yes, but only the
menus. And I maintain that the menus are better for it.

"To those who ask whether I will stop: no. I have a third volume
planned, covering the cuisines of the twenty-second through twenty-fifth
centuries, and I can report from personal experience that the future is
delicious.

"Bon appétit."

The second edition included a recipe for something called "Martian Colony
Bread, circa 2247 CE," which used a grain that did not yet exist but
which, three months after the book's publication, was independently
developed by a botanist in Kansas who insisted she had come up with the
idea entirely on her own.

Dr. Hubbard did not find this reassuring.

She baked the bread anyway. It was, as promised, delicious.

                          SALVAGE RIGHTS

                        by Theodore Cain

================================================================================

                               I.

The derelict drifted in the dark between Barnard's Star and Wolf 359,
three hundred light-years from the nearest human settlement and not on
any shipping lane anyone had ever charted. It was large — half a mile
long, roughly cylindrical, with a hull that caught their searchlights
and threw back reflections in colors that didn't belong to any alloy in
the human catalog.

Captain Nina Kovac saw it first on the long-range scope, a blip that
shouldn't have been there, and she watched it for six hours before she
was sure it was real.

"Alien," she said to her crew. "Derelict. And it's ours."

The crew of the *Magpie* — six people, one ship, and a cargo hold full
of cutting equipment — had been running the deep salvage routes for four
years. They worked the spaces between the stars, the empty lanes where
things drifted and were lost: dead satellites, spent boosters, the
occasional abandoned colony ship whose crew had died or given up. The
pay was sporadic, the work was dangerous, and the competition was fierce.
A genuine alien derelict was the find of a lifetime.

"How do we know it's derelict?" asked Tomas, her second in command, a
cautious man whose caution had kept them alive more than once.

"No emissions. No drive signature. No heat beyond ambient. It's cold,
Tomas. Cold as the void."

"Could be dormant."

"Could be. But dormant ships maintain minimal systems — life support
cycling, nav beacons, something. This thing is putting out nothing. It's
dead."

Tomas studied the scope reading. "And if it's not dead?"

"Then we proceed with extreme caution and make a fortune anyway."

Kovac brought the *Magpie* in slow, matching the derelict's drift on
approach thrusters, and they had been circling for two hours, mapping
the hull with every sensor they had, when the second ship appeared.

It came in from the opposite direction, decelerating hard, and Kovac
knew what it was before the transponder signal confirmed it: the *Iron
Promise*, Captain Darren Salt, six crew, heavy-salvage rated. Salt and
Kovac had been competitors for a decade, and their relationship hovered
somewhere between grudging respect and the kind of animosity that, in
an earlier era, would have been settled with pistols.

"Kovac." Salt's voice crackled over the comm. He had a deep voice, a
Texan drawl, and a habit of sounding amused by everything. "Fancy
meeting you here."

"We were here first, Salt."

"I'm sure you were. But 'here' is unclaimed deep space, and under the
Interstellar Salvage Convention of 2089, discovery rights are established
by physical contact with the derelict, not proximity. Have you boarded
yet?"

Kovac's jaw tightened. She had not boarded yet. She'd been running sensor
sweeps, which was the smart play — you didn't walk onto an alien ship
without knowing what was inside — but which, under the letter of the law,
meant she had not established salvage rights.

"We were about to board."

"So were we. Seems like we've got ourselves a race."

Kovac muted the comm and turned to Tomas. "What do our sensors show?"

Tomas scrolled through the data they'd collected during the two-hour
survey. "Hull composition: unknown alloy, doesn't match anything in the
database. No atmosphere inside — vacuum throughout, as far as we can
tell. Internal structure is — strange. The layout doesn't conform to
any engineering logic I recognize. Lots of large open spaces, no obvious
compartmentalization. Could be cargo bays. Could be living quarters.
Could be something we have no category for."

"Life signs?"

"None. No biological signatures, no energy readings, no electromagnetic
activity. It's dead, Captain. Dead as anything I've ever scanned."

Kovac drummed her fingers on the console. She'd been in salvage for
twelve years, and she'd learned early that the two most dangerous words
in the business were "it's dead." Ships that appeared dead had a way of
surprising you — trapped atmosphere that blew out when you breached a
hull, unstable reactors that went critical when you applied power,
automated defense systems that didn't distinguish between salvage crews
and hostile boarders.

And this was an alien ship. Human ships, at least, followed human logic.
This thing followed something else entirely.

"Salt is going to board if we don't," Tomas said.

"Let him. Better his crew than ours if there's a surprise waiting."

"And if there's not, he claims salvage rights and we lose the biggest
find of our careers."

Kovac stared at the derelict through the viewport. It hung in the dark,
massive and inert, reflecting their searchlights in those strange,
unnameable colors. The hull was smooth — no seams, no rivets, no
welding marks. It looked less like something that had been built and
more like something that had grown.

"Fine," she said. "We board. But carefully. Full pressure suits,
tethered, and nobody touches anything until I say so."

She unmuted the comm. "Salt, here's what we're going to do."


                               II.

The race became an argument, and the argument became a negotiation, and
the negotiation became the most ridiculous legal proceeding ever
conducted in deep space.

Both ships docked on opposite sides of the derelict — the *Magpie* at
what Kovac's sensors suggested was an airlock on the port side, the
*Iron Promise* at a similar structure on the starboard. Neither captain
was willing to board while the other might claim the interior first, and
neither was willing to leave.

They argued by radio for three hours.

"Section 14, paragraph 3 of the Salvage Convention," Kovac said, reading
from her ship's legal database. "Priority is established by the first
crew to make physical contact with the salvage object. We were within
sensor range first."

"Section 14, paragraph 3, subsection (b)," Salt replied, reading from
his. "'Physical contact' is defined as direct mechanical attachment to
the hull or entry into the interior. Sensor range doesn't count, Kovac.
If it did, every telescope on Earth would have salvage rights to the
Moon."

"Section 16, paragraph 1: 'In the event of simultaneous arrival,
priority may be established by negotiation between the parties.'"

"I'm happy to negotiate. I propose a fifty-fifty split."

"I propose you leave."

"Counter-proposal: I stay, and you leave."

This went on. Tomas, who had studied law before turning to salvage work,
pulled up increasingly obscure subsections. Salt's legal expert, a wiry
woman named Petersen who had apparently memorized the entire Convention,
countered each one. They debated the definition of "simultaneous." They
debated the definition of "arrival." They debated whether a ship that
was still decelerating had technically "arrived" or was still "arriving,"
and if the latter, whether the Convention distinguished between the two
states.

"Section 22, paragraph 7," Petersen offered over the radio, her voice
carrying the dry patience of a woman accustomed to making other people
feel stupid. "In cases of disputed priority, the salvage authority may
designate a neutral third party to adjudicate. Since there is no neutral
third party within three hundred light-years, I suggest we table the
legal debate and split the proceeds."

"I found it first," Kovac said.

"You scanned it first. That's like saying you own a house because you
drove past it."

"I mapped the hull. I identified the probable entry points. I spent two
hours doing the survey work that you're going to benefit from."

"And I appreciate the effort, Captain Kovac. I'll express my
appreciation in the form of a forty-sixty split in your favor."

"Sixty-forty? For a fifty-percent haircut on my discovery?"

"You'll note I said forty-sixty in YOUR favor."

"Oh." Kovac paused. "That's actually reasonable."

"Don't sound so surprised. I'm a reasonable man."

"You once tried to claim salvage on a ship I was still docked to."

"That was a misunderstanding of Section 9. My lawyer agreed it was
ambiguous."

"Your lawyer was your brother-in-law."

"Also a misunderstanding."

The negotiation continued, circling like two boxers who respected each
other too much to throw the first punch and not enough to lower their
guards. Meanwhile, the derelict drifted on, silent and cold, half a
mile of alien mystery patiently waiting, and no one noticed the
temperature change.


                              III.

It was Tomas who noticed.

He had been monitoring the sensor feeds while Kovac and Salt argued, and
at hour four of the standoff, he interrupted with two words that cut
through the legal jargon like a blade:

"It's warming."

Kovac stopped mid-sentence. "What?"

"The derelict. Its hull temperature has risen two degrees since we
docked. It was at ambient — three Kelvin above absolute zero. Now it's
at five."

"Two degrees is nothing. Thermal radiation from our ships —"

"I accounted for that. Our thermal output would raise the hull
temperature by point-three degrees at most. This is seven times that."

Silence on the radio. Then Salt's voice: "We're seeing the same thing
on our side."

Kovac looked at the sensor readout. Two degrees. From a ship that had
been putting out nothing — no emissions, no heat, no sign of life.

"Pull the crew back to the *Magpie*," she said.

"We haven't boarded yet," Tomas said.

"I know. Pull them back."

Tomas relayed the order. On the radio, she could hear Salt giving the
same command to his crew.

The temperature rose to eight Kelvin. Then twelve. Then twenty.

At thirty Kelvin, the derelict's hull began to change color. The alien
alloy — which had been a dull, non-reflective gray under their
searchlights — shifted through a spectrum that started at deep violet
and moved toward something that registered on their sensors as infrared
but looked, through the viewport, like the color of an ember.

At fifty Kelvin, the airlock where the *Magpie* was docked began to
open.

Kovac had not touched the airlock. No one had. It was opening from the
inside.

"Salt."

"I see it. Ours too."

"Detach. Now."

The *Magpie's* docking clamps released. Kovac hit the thrusters and
pulled away, and the *Iron Promise* mirrored the maneuver on the
opposite side, and both ships backed off to a distance of five hundred
meters, and from there they watched the derelict come alive.

It was like watching a creature wake from hibernation. Systems activated
in sequence, lights appearing along the hull in patterns that might have
been decorative or might have been functional, a low-frequency hum
building in the electromagnetic spectrum that both ships could detect
on their comm arrays. The hull continued to warm. The airlocks yawned
open, then closed, then opened again, cycling through what looked like
a startup sequence.

And then the drive lit.

It was not like a human drive. There was no exhaust plume, no visible
thrust. Instead, the space behind the derelict seemed to compress —
a distortion, like heat haze, that bent the stars behind it into
smeared lines. The ship began to move. Slowly at first, then faster,
then much faster, accelerating in a direction that led deeper into
interstellar space.

In ninety seconds, it was gone.

Kovac stared at the empty space where the derelict had been. The stars
unsmeared themselves. The background radiation returned to normal. There
was nothing left — no debris, no trail, no evidence that half a mile of
alien ship had been drifting there five minutes ago.

Salt's voice came over the radio, stripped of its usual amusement: "Was
that —"

"It wasn't a derelict," Kovac said. "It was never a derelict. It was
waiting."

"Waiting for what?"

Kovac thought about it. A ship, drifting cold and dark in empty space,
putting out no emissions, showing no signs of life. Looking exactly like
a wreck. And when two ships docked — when two crews made physical contact
with its hull, when heat and vibration and electromagnetic radiation told
it that something alive was nearby —

It woke up.

"Waiting for us," she said.


                               IV.

They found the marker an hour later, after both crews had stopped shaking
and started thinking.

It was floating at the precise coordinates where the derelict had been —
a small object, no larger than a fist, made of the same alien alloy.
It was putting out a signal: a simple, repeating pulse on a frequency
that both ships could receive.

Petersen, Salt's legal expert, was the one who decoded it. The signal
contained a data packet — small, compressed, and formatted in a way
that was clearly designed to be comprehensible to anyone with basic
mathematics. It took her two hours to crack, working alongside Tomas,
the two former adversaries hunched over a shared screen in the *Magpie's*
galley while their captains stood behind them and tried not to hover.

The message was short.

"It's a warning," Petersen said, sitting back. "Or a thank-you. Or both.
It's hard to tell — the language structure doesn't map cleanly onto
human concepts."

"Best guess," Kovac said.

"Best guess: 'I was sleeping. You woke me. The sleep was long and I was
in danger. Thank you. Do not approach my kind when we sleep. We are not
dead. We are dreaming. When we dream, we do not know friend from food.
You were fortunate.'"

The four of them sat in silence for a while.

"Friend from food," Salt repeated.

"That's my best translation."

"The ship was alive," Tomas said. "The whole thing. Not a vehicle with a
crew. A living organism."

"A living organism the size of a shopping mall," Salt said. "That
hibernates in deep space. And eats things that wake it up."

"Not this time," Petersen said. "The message says we were fortunate."

"Define fortunate."

"We detached before the feeding response activated."

Kovac thought about the airlocks opening from the inside. The warm hull.
The way the lights had come on in sequence, like a creature's nervous
system firing in order — extremities first, then core, then brain. She
thought about how close they had come to sending boarding parties inside.

"If we'd gone in," she said. "If we'd walked through those airlocks
while it was waking up —"

"Then the legal question of salvage rights would have been resolved,"
Salt said quietly, "by the absence of anyone alive to file a claim."

Tomas pulled up the long-range scanner. "Question. If there's one of
these things drifting out here, are there more?"

Nobody answered immediately. The dark between the stars was vast, and
it was full of things that drifted — rocks, ice, the debris of ancient
systems. Generations of survey teams had cataloged thousands of objects
in interstellar space, and the standard protocol for anything that
appeared to be a derelict was to approach, scan, and board.

"Every cold contact we've ever flagged," Kovac said slowly. "Every
drifting hull that showed no emissions and no life signs. We assumed
they were wrecks."

"Some of them were wrecks," Salt said.

"And some of them," Petersen said, very carefully, "may have been
sleeping."

Another silence. This one lasted longer.

Kovac looked at Salt. Salt looked at Kovac. For the first time in ten
years of rivalry, they were in complete agreement.

"I suggest," Kovac said, "that we file this find with the Salvage
Authority, mark these coordinates as hazardous, and leave."

"I suggest the same," Salt said. "And I suggest we don't mention the
part about arguing over salvage rights while sitting on the lip of a
sleeping predator."

"Agreed."

"Agreed."

They transmitted the warning marker's coordinates and message to the
nearest deep-space relay, coded as a navigational hazard. Then both ships
fired their drives and left the darkness between the stars to whatever
dreamed in it.

Behind them, the marker pulsed its simple signal into the void — a
warning, or a thank-you, or both — and the empty space held its silence,
and somewhere in the dark, something vast and ancient continued its
sleep, and dreamed, perhaps, of the small warm things that had been wise
enough to leave before the dream became a hunger.

                   THE EQUATION THAT ATE CHICAGO

                       by Douglas Pemberton

================================================================================

                               I.

The trouble began, as trouble so often does in academic circles, with a
man who was too clever for anyone's good, least of all his own.

Professor Quentin Frobisher occupied a corner office on the third floor
of the University of Chicago's mathematics department, a room
distinguished by its view of a parking lot, its aroma of chalk dust and
stale pipe tobacco, and the presence, on every available surface, of
papers covered in equations that no one in the department — and possibly
no one on Earth — could follow. He was fifty-three years old, five feet
six inches tall, and in possession of a beard that could most charitably
be described as aspirational. He wore the same brown tweed jacket every
day, owned precisely two neckties (one for Mondays through Fridays, one
for occasions of extraordinary significance), and had once been
discovered asleep in the faculty lounge under a tablecloth, having
confused the lounge with his bedroom, which was, he protested afterward,
an easy mistake to make given that both rooms contained uncomfortable
furniture and an overabundance of biscuits.

In short, he was a mathematician.

He was, more specifically, the kind of mathematician whose brilliance
existed at such a rarefied altitude that it was invisible to the
naked eye, like certain species of atmospheric phenomena that can only
be detected by instruments sensitive enough to distinguish between
nothing and very nearly nothing. His colleagues respected him. His
students feared him. His dean regarded him with the wary affection one
reserves for a distinguished but unpredictable animal that one has,
through some contractual obligation, agreed to house.

And on the morning of March 14th, 1954 — a date that mathematicians
will recognize as Pi Day, which Frobisher celebrated annually by eating
pie and muttering about irrational numbers — he wrote, on the
blackboard of his corner office, an equation.

It was not a long equation. Frobisher's previous work had tended toward
the baroque — proofs that sprawled across dozens of pages, theorems
that required their own table of contents. This equation occupied a
single line. It was clean, elegant, and balanced in the way that a well-
constructed sentence is balanced, or a well-designed bridge, or a piece
of music by Bach.

He stepped back and looked at it. He looked at it for a long time.

"Good Lord," he said.


                               II.

The equation described, as nearly as Frobisher could determine, the
fundamental relationship between mathematics and physical reality. This
was not, in itself, unusual — many equations describe aspects of physical
reality; that is rather the point of applied mathematics. But Frobisher's
equation did not describe a specific aspect. It described the relationship
itself — the mechanism by which mathematical truth and physical fact
are connected, the reason that the universe bothers to obey equations
at all.

He did not understand it fully. He was honest enough to admit this,
though honesty in a mathematician of Frobisher's caliber was rather
like modesty in a peacock — technically present but not the dominant
impression. He understood enough to know that the equation was correct.
It had the quality that mathematicians call "beauty" and that everyone
else calls "making the hair on the back of your neck stand up."

He also understood enough to be slightly worried.

The worry crystallized at approximately 11:30 AM, when he noticed that
his office had become symmetric.

Not entirely symmetric — the desk was still in the corner, the window
still overlooked the parking lot — but the clutter on his desk, which
had previously existed in a state of cheerful chaos that would have
given an entropy theorist palpitations, had rearranged itself. His papers
were stacked in order of size. His pencils were aligned in parallel.
His coffee mug sat at the precise center of a coaster, equidistant from
the edges.

Frobisher was not, as a rule, a tidy man. The mug had moved on its own.

He tested this hypothesis by moving the mug to the left. He turned away.
When he looked back, the mug was centered again.

"Ah," he said, with the calm of a man who has spent his entire life
preparing for the possibility that mathematics might someday do something
irresponsible. "That's not ideal."


                              III.

The effect spread, as effects do, outward.

By noon, Frobisher's office was in a state of mathematical perfection
that would have delighted Marie Kondo and horrified everyone else. Every
object occupied a position that satisfied the spatial relationships
implied by the equation on the blackboard. Books arranged themselves by
the golden ratio. The angle between the window and the desk resolved to
exactly pi radians. The dust motes in the shaft of sunlight through the
window moved in Fibonacci spirals.

Frobisher attempted to erase the equation. The chalk would not come off
the blackboard. He tried a wet cloth. The equation remained. He tried a
different blackboard — carried in from the adjacent classroom by two
perplexed graduate students — and discovered that the equation had
already appeared on it, written in chalk that no one had applied.

"The equation is propagating," he told the graduate students, who
stared at him with the wide-eyed incomprehension of people who had not
yet caught up with events. "It has achieved a level of mathematical
truth sufficient to cause physical reality to conform to its structure.
In simpler terms: I have written a perfect equation, and now reality
is trying to become perfect to match it."

"Is that... bad?" asked graduate student Perkins, who was the more
optimistic of the two.

"That depends," Frobisher said, "on how much you like your current
reality the way it is."

By two o'clock, the effect had reached the hallway. Faculty members
arriving for afternoon office hours found the corridor's floor tiles
rearranged into a perfect tessellation. The drinking fountain dispensed
water at a temperature of precisely 4 degrees Celsius — the temperature
of maximum density, the most "mathematically efficient" temperature for
water to occupy. The clock on the wall, which had been three minutes
fast for as long as anyone could remember, was now exactly correct, and
the second hand swept around the dial with a precision that made the
janitor, a man named Gus who had been winding the clock for twenty years,
weep with an emotion he could not name.

By four o'clock, the effect had reached the rest of the mathematics
building. Chairs arranged themselves in optimal configurations.
Thermostats set themselves to the most energy-efficient temperatures.
The building's electrical wiring, which had been a fire hazard since
1928, reorganized itself behind the walls with a series of small,
purposeful clicks that the janitor attributed to mice and the
electrician attributed to divine intervention.

By six o'clock, the effect had crossed the quad and was advancing toward
the physics department.

The crossing of the quad was particularly dramatic. A group of students
playing touch football discovered that the ball, upon being thrown,
followed a perfect parabolic trajectory regardless of the thrower's aim
or intent. Every pass was a spiral. Every punt reached precisely the
same apex. The game, deprived of uncertainty, became intolerable within
minutes, and the students abandoned it to stand in a huddle and stare
at the mathematics building with the dawning horror of young men who
have just realized that their weekend might be endangered by an equation.

In the faculty cafeteria, the soup achieved a state of thermal
equilibrium so precise that every spoonful was exactly the same
temperature. The vending machine, which had been accepting slugs since
1947, began rejecting any coin whose weight deviated from the mint
standard by more than a hundredth of a gram. The jukebox, unplugged
since March, began playing Bach.

Professor Emeritus Walter Fitzmaurice, age eighty-one, who had occupied
an office in the mathematics building for forty-three years and had not
been surprised by anything since the invention of television, walked
past Frobisher's office, paused, looked at the equation on the
blackboard through the open door, and said: "Well, that's torn it,"
before continuing down the hall at his customary pace, which was,
Frobisher noticed, now precisely two miles per hour.


                               IV.

Dean Herbert Moncrieff was a man whose relationship with reality had
always been one of mutual accommodation — he did not ask too much of
it, and it returned the favor. He was, therefore, profoundly unprepared
for the telephone call he received at 6:47 PM from Professor Amelia
Stokes of the physics department, who informed him, in a voice that
suggested she was either very excited or very frightened, that the
fundamental constants of nature were changing.

"Not changing dramatically," she clarified, as though this were a
comfort. "Not changing in a way that would, say, cause atoms to fly
apart or gravity to reverse itself. Changing in the direction of
greater mathematical elegance. The gravitational constant is converging
on a value that simplifies several equations in general relativity.
The fine-structure constant is trending toward an expression that would
make quantum electrodynamics — well — tidier."

"Tidier," Dean Moncrieff repeated.

"Much tidier. Herbert, the universe is becoming a better-organized
version of itself, and it appears to be emanating from the third floor
of the mathematics building."

Dean Moncrieff put down the telephone, took a deep breath, and went
to find Professor Frobisher.

He found Frobisher sitting in his now-immaculate office, smoking his
pipe (the smoke rose in a perfect helix), drinking tea from a cup that
sat with geometric precision in its saucer, and looking at the equation
on the blackboard with an expression that combined professional pride
with existential alarm.

"Frobisher," Moncrieff said. "What have you done?"

"I have written a perfect equation, Herbert."

"I see that. And what does a perfect equation do?"

"Precisely what you'd expect. It makes things perfect."

"Can you make it stop?"

Frobisher drew on his pipe. The smoke spiraled upward in a helix so
regular it could have been drawn with a compass. "That is an interesting
question. The equation describes a relationship that is, by definition,
true. You cannot make a true thing untrue. You can only write a different
truth — a counter-equation, as it were — that describes a reality in
which imperfection is the natural state."

"And can you do that?"

"Possibly. But it would require me to write a deliberately imperfect
equation, which is rather like asking a musician to play a deliberately
wrong note. It goes against the grain."

"Frobisher, the universe is reorganizing itself around your blackboard.
The physics department says the gravitational constant is changing. I
have a custodian who won't stop crying because the clock is correct.
Write the wrong note."

Frobisher looked at the equation. He looked at the office, which was,
he had to admit, considerably more pleasant in its mathematically
optimized state. He looked at the view from his window, where the
parking lot — that concrete monument to human mediocrity — was
rearranging its cars into a pattern that satisfied a previously
unsuspected aesthetic principle of automotive distribution.

"The thing is, Herbert," he said thoughtfully, "it is a very good
equation."

"I don't care how good it is. Chicago is not equipped to be perfect."

"You make a fair point. Chicago is, if anything, the opposite of perfect.
It is a city built on swampland by people who thought swampland was a
reasonable foundation for a metropolis. Its weather is an argument against
intelligent design. Its politics make Machiavelli look like an amateur.
Imposing mathematical perfection on Chicago would be — well — it would
be like putting a tuxedo on a bulldog. Technically possible, but
fundamentally at odds with the bulldog's character."

"Then stop it."

"I should point out, Herbert, that there are certain benefits to the
current situation. The electrical wiring, for instance. The building
inspector has been threatening us for years, and the equation has
accomplished more in six hours than three rounds of renovation budgets.
The cafeteria soup has never been better. And Professor Fitzmaurice
tells me he can now find his reading glasses every time he puts them
down, because they migrate to the mathematically optimal position on
his desk."

"Frobisher."

"Furthermore, the students report that the football now flies in perfect
spirals, which I would have thought —"

"FROBISHER."

"Yes, Herbert?"

"The city of Chicago is on the other side of our campus. The third-
largest city in the United States. Four million people. If your equation
reaches Michigan Avenue, the traffic lights will synchronize perfectly,
which sounds delightful until you realize that Chicago traffic has been
an organic chaos system for fifty years and any sudden optimization will
cause the most mathematically elegant gridlock in automotive history.
Stop. The. Equation."

Frobisher considered this. He considered the traffic. He considered four
million Chicagoans experiencing the sudden, unwelcome imposition of
mathematical order on a civic infrastructure that had evolved, over
decades, to function precisely because of its imperfections — the late
buses that gave commuters time to finish their coffee, the potholes that
slowed drivers to safe speeds, the crooked sidewalks that gave the city
its character.

"Very well." Frobisher set down his pipe, picked up a piece of chalk,
and approached the blackboard.


                               V.

The counter-equation took him four hours.

It was not elegant. It was not beautiful. It was, in fact, the ugliest
piece of mathematics Frobisher had ever written, and writing it caused
him physical discomfort, like a composer forced to resolve a symphony
on a diminished seventh. It was an equation that described, precisely
and irrefutably, the fundamental role of imperfection in the structure
of reality — the necessity of disorder, the function of randomness, the
mathematical beauty inherent in things that refuse to add up.

It was, paradoxically, brilliant.

He wrote it on the blackboard next to the original equation, and the
two stood side by side like a thesis and its antithesis, two truths that
contradicted each other and were both correct.

The effect began to reverse. The pencils on his desk relaxed from their
parallel formation and sprawled at random angles. The coffee mug wandered
off-center. The dust motes abandoned their Fibonacci spirals and resumed
their aimless drift. In the hallway, the floor tiles shuffled back to
their original imperfect arrangement, and the clock settled into its
comfortable habit of running three minutes fast.

The parking lot, observed from the window, returned to chaos.

Dean Moncrieff, who had been watching over Frobisher's shoulder with
the expression of a man watching a surgeon operate on a bomb, allowed
himself to breathe.

"Is it contained?"

"It is balanced," Frobisher corrected. "The original equation is still
true. Reality is still, in its fundamental nature, mathematical. But the
counter-equation is also true: reality is also, in its fundamental
nature, messy. The two truths will coexist, as they always have. I
merely — temporarily — disturbed the balance."

"See that you don't do it again."

"I make no promises, Herbert. Mathematics is an unruly discipline."

Moncrieff left. Frobisher sat in his office, looked at the two equations
on his blackboard — perfection and imperfection, order and disorder, the
universe as it could be and the universe as it insisted on being — and
smiled.

Then he moved his coffee mug slightly off-center, just to make sure it
stayed.

It did. The universe, imperfect and indifferent, was working as designed.

Frobisher lit his pipe, put on his second necktie — the one for occasions
of extraordinary significance — and went home, leaving the equations to
argue with each other in the dark.

                           SOLAR WIND

                      by Robert "Bob" Finley

================================================================================

                               I.

The starting gun was a flare from the race marshal's cutter, a burst
of white-hot magnesium against the black, and forty-seven solar yachts
unfurled their sails and caught the light.

Captain Ines Guerrero gripped the helm of the *Viento Libre* and felt
the surge through her boots — that first kick of solar radiation hitting
the sail, photon pressure translating into acceleration, and the whole
ship leaning into the wind like a clipper rounding Cape Horn. It was the
best feeling in the solar system. Better than whiskey. Better than
shore leave on Ganymede. Better, if she was being honest, than just
about anything she'd ever experienced, and Ines Guerrero had experienced
a fair amount.

The race was the Mercury-to-Neptune Grand Prix, the longest and most
dangerous yacht race in human history. Eight billion miles of open
space, from the blistering orbit of Mercury to the frozen dark of the
outer system, powered by nothing but sunlight. The sails were vast —
the *Viento Libre's* mainsail spread two square kilometers of
aluminized Mylar, thinner than a soap bubble, that caught the solar
wind and converted it to motion. At close range to the Sun, the pressure
was fierce — enough to push a well-rigged yacht to speeds that made
conventional rockets look like rowboats. As you moved outward, the
pressure dropped, and the race became a test of skill, patience, and
nerve: who could carry the most speed from the inner system into the
darkness beyond.

"Clean start," said Tomás Rivera, her navigator, checking the spread
of the fleet on his scope. "We're third off the line. *Sunfire* and
*Golden Ratio* are ahead."

"Let them run. They'll burn their sails pushing too hard near Mercury.
We ride easy until Venus, then we pour it on."

The *Viento Libre* was a sixty-foot sloop, built in the orbital yards
above Havana by a Cuban shipwright named Esperanza who understood solar
yachts the way other people understood guitars — as instruments to be
played, not merely operated. She had a carbon-fiber hull, a sail rigged
for both close-reach and broad-reach configurations, and a crew of four:
Guerrero at the helm, Rivera on navigation, Kofi Mensah on sail trim,
and Dr. Lena Vogt as ship's engineer and medic.

They were not the favorites. The favorites were *Sunfire*, skippered by
Anatoly Kestrel, a three-time Grand Prix champion who had once sailed
from Mercury to Jupiter on a bet, and *Golden Ratio*, skippered by
Mei-Lin Park, a Korean racer who had designed her own sail material and
was rumored to have achieved a close-reach efficiency twelve percent
above the theoretical maximum. The *Viento Libre* was fast but not the
fastest, tough but not the toughest. What she had was a captain who
had grown up sailing fishing boats in the Caribbean and understood wind
— any kind of wind, even the kind that came from a star — in her bones.

"Sail pressure nominal," Kofi reported. "Running clean."

Ines settled in. Eight billion miles ahead of her, Neptune hung like a
blue marble in the dark, and between here and there was nothing but
light and vacuum and the kind of silence that made you either a poet or
a lunatic. She'd been at this long enough to be a little of both.


                               II.

The first three days were racing at its finest.

The fleet spread out across the inner system like a school of silver
fish, each yacht angling for the optimal trajectory — close enough to
the Sun to maximize photon pressure, far enough to keep the sail intact.
Too close and the radiation would fry the Mylar; too far and you lost
speed. The sweet spot was a ribbon of space between the orbits of
Mercury and Venus, where the solar wind blew strongest and the light
was pure and fierce.

Ines held the *Viento Libre* to the outside of the pack, letting the
aggressive skippers jockey for the close-in positions. Rivera plotted
a slingshot trajectory that would use Venus's gravity to boost their
speed without sacrificing their angle. Kofi trimmed the sail with the
precision of a man threading a needle in a hurricane, adjusting the
rigging in increments of microradians to catch every photon.

By day three, they were seventh. *Sunfire* led, with *Golden Ratio*
close behind. The rest of the fleet was strung out over two million
kilometers, a glittering necklace of reflected light against the black.

Then the Solar Observatory on Mercury transmitted the alert.

"Flare warning," Rivera said, his voice suddenly tight. "Class X-9.
The big one."

Ines felt the words hit her gut like cold water. A Class X-9 solar
flare was the largest classification — a coronal mass ejection that
would send a wave of charged particles and radiation screaming outward
from the Sun at three million miles an hour. In the inner system, an
X-9 flare was lethal. The radiation alone would fry electronics, cook
flesh, and shred solar sails like tissue paper in a blowtorch. The
particle wavefront behind it would be even worse — a tsunami of charged
plasma that could strip the hull of an unshielded ship down to the
spars.

"Time to impact?"

"Eighteen hours. The wavefront will hit the fleet between the orbits of
Venus and Earth."

"Where we are right now."

"Where we are right now."

Ines looked at the fleet spread across her scope. Forty-seven ships.
Forty-seven crews. Most of them were in the same band of space as the
*Viento Libre*, riding the sweet spot between Mercury and Venus. The
flare would catch them all.

"Race marshal's signaling," Rivera said. "All ships: return to Mercury
Station. Race suspended."

That was the safe play. Turn back toward Mercury, where the orbital
station had radiation shelters rated for X-class events. It would take
twelve hours on a hard tack, but most ships could make it. The race
would restart after the flare passed.

Ines looked at the numbers. She looked at the fleet disposition. She
looked at the flare data, scrolling across Rivera's screen in red.

"Tomás," she said. "What if we didn't turn back?"

Rivera looked at her.

"The wavefront is moving at three million miles per hour. We're
currently making eight hundred thousand. If we furled the mainsail, we
couldn't outrun it. But if we deployed full sail — maximum spread,
broad-reach, running with the flare instead of against it —"

"You want to ride the wavefront."

"The wavefront is a pressure wave. The biggest pressure wave the Sun
has thrown at us this decade. If we catch it right — if we angle the
sail to ride the leading edge instead of getting hit broadside — it
would accelerate us faster than any yacht has ever moved. We could use
the flare to slingshot past the entire fleet. By the time they restart
the race from Mercury, we'd be past Mars."

"And if we angle it wrong?"

"We die."

Rivera was quiet for a moment. "What's the margin?"

"Kofi, you're the sail man. Can you hold a broad-reach trim in an X-9
wavefront?"

Kofi Mensah looked up from his console. He was a big man, quiet, from
a sailing family in Accra that had been working the Gold Coast waters
for generations. He thought about it the way he thought about everything
— slowly, thoroughly, without drama.

"The sail will take it if we reinforce the corner grommets and run
backup stays on the main halyard. The pressure differential will be
extreme — we're talking about riding the edge of a wave that could rip
us apart if we fall off the crest. I'd need to trim continuously, hands
on the line the whole time."

"Can you do it?"

"I can do it."

"Lena?"

Dr. Vogt, who had been listening from the engine compartment hatch, said:
"The radiation exposure will be significant, even behind the hull
shielding. I can dose us with rad-blockers and we'll be within
survivable limits, but we'll all need medical attention at the finish.
And if the shielding fails —"

"Understood." Ines looked at her crew. Three people who trusted her with
their lives. "I'm not ordering this. This is a volunteer run. If any
one of you says no, we turn back to Mercury with the rest of the fleet."

Rivera looked at his charts. Kofi looked at his rigging. Vogt looked
at her medical kit. Nobody said no.

"Then we run," Ines said.


                              III.

The fleet turned back. Forty-six ships furled their sails and fired
maneuvering thrusters, arcing toward Mercury Station in a long, slow
curve. The *Viento Libre* unfurled.

Ines ordered full deployment — every square meter of sail, the mainsail
and the two jibs and the auxiliary spanker that Esperanza had built in
"for emergencies and for showing off." The ship spread her wings like an
albatross, two and a half square kilometers of aluminized Mylar catching
the sunlight, and the acceleration pushed Ines back in her seat as the
*Viento Libre* surged forward.

They were running now — running ahead of the flare, trying to stay in
front of the wavefront rather than being overtaken by it. It was like
surfing ahead of a tsunami, and the metaphor was almost exact: the
flare was a wave, and they needed to catch it at the leading edge, where
the pressure was strongest but the radiation was diffused by the wave's
own expansion.

Rivera called out the numbers. "Wavefront in sixteen hours. Our velocity
is climbing — nine hundred thousand... nine-fifty... one million miles
per hour. We need to be at two million by the time it reaches us."

"Kofi, more sail."

"She's at max spread. I can angle the jibs another three degrees for a
tighter reach —"

"Do it."

The *Viento Libre* accelerated. The Sun blazed behind them, enormous
and furious, and Ines could feel its anger in the way the ship trembled
under the increasing pressure — a vibration that ran through the hull
like a bass note, deep and resonant, the sound of a star pushing a
sixty-foot boat across the vacuum.

Hours passed. The wavefront closed. Rivera counted it down like a
metronome — twelve hours, eight hours, four. The radiation levels
climbed. Vogt administered the rad-blockers and sealed the crew
compartment. The ship's electronics flickered, stabilized, flickered
again.

At two hours, the light changed.

It came from behind them — a brightening, not gradual but sudden, as
though someone had turned up the Sun's dimmer switch. The solar wind,
which had been a steady pressure on the sail, began to gusts — surges
of photon pressure that made the rigging sing and the hull groan.

"One hour," Rivera said. "Velocity one-point-eight million. We need
more speed."

"Kofi, can you catch the gusts?"

"Working on it." His hands moved on the rigging controls, adjusting
the sail angle with each gust, feathering the edge of the Mylar to
catch the surge and release the lull, and the *Viento Libre* leaped
forward with each adjustment. It was like watching a master sailor
work — instinct and skill translated into acceleration, the oldest
art in the world applied to the newest ocean.

"Two million," Rivera said. "Two-point-one. Two-point-three."

The wavefront hit.

It was not a wall. It was a gradient — a steep, rising slope of
pressure and radiation that washed over the ship from stern to bow.
The sail bellied outward, straining against the stays, and the
acceleration hit Ines like a punch in the chest. She was pressed back
into her seat, and the ship sang — a high, keening note that was
the sound of two and a half square kilometers of Mylar vibrating at
its resonant frequency under the force of a star's rage.

"Three million!" Rivera shouted over the noise. "Four million! Ines,
we're on the crest!"

She could feel it — the sweet spot, the leading edge of the wave, where
the pressure was maximum and the ship was moving with the wavefront
instead of being overtaken by it. It was like riding a barrel wave in
the Caribbean, the moment when the water lifts you and you're balanced
on the edge of something enormous, and everything is speed and noise
and the pure animal joy of being alive in a place where you absolutely
should not be.

"Hold this trim, Kofi! Hold it!"

"Holding!"

The *Viento Libre* rode the crest of the flare. Behind them, the Sun
threw its tantrum, and the radiation howled, and the charged particles
screamed past the hull, and the sail held. Kofi trimmed it with the
touch of a man who had spent his life reading wind, adjusting for
each surge and each lull, keeping the ship balanced on the edge of
the wave.

They rode it for six hours.

Six hours of impossible speed, the stars blurring past the viewports,
the ship shaking and singing and flying on the breath of a star. Six
hours in which the *Viento Libre* covered more distance than any solar
yacht had ever covered in a single run. Six hours in which Ines
Guerrero held the helm and grinned and felt, in the marrow of her
bones, the joy that had drawn her to the sky in the first place.


                               IV.

The wavefront passed. The pressure eased. The sail, battered but intact,
drooped as the solar wind returned to normal — still pushing, still
driving them outward, but gently now, the fury spent.

Rivera ran the numbers.

"We passed Mars two hours ago. Current velocity: declining, but we're
carrying enough momentum to coast to the asteroid belt on inertia alone.
When the fleet restarts from Mercury, we'll have a six-week lead."

"The sail?"

"Degraded. Maybe forty percent efficiency. The flare scorched the outer
layer. We can still make way, but we won't be setting any speed records
from here."

"Don't need to. Six weeks is six weeks."

Vogt checked them over. The radiation exposure was within the survivable
range she had predicted — they would all need treatment at the finish,
and Ines suspected her hair was going to fall out again, which was a
nuisance because she'd just grown it back from the last race — but they
were alive and functional and moving very, very fast in the right
direction.

Kofi sat by the viewport, looking at his hands. They were shaking. He'd
held the rigging for six hours against the force of a solar storm, and
the muscles in his forearms were cramped solid.

Ines sat down beside him. "You alright?"

"That was the best sailing I've ever done in my life."

"Yes, it was."

"I don't think I can move my fingers."

"Vogt will fix your fingers. That's what she's for."

The *Viento Libre* sailed on, carried by momentum and the gentle, steady
breath of a star that had finished shouting and was now, in the manner of
stars, pretending nothing had happened. Behind them, the fleet was
regrouping at Mercury Station. Ahead of them, Neptune waited in the dark,
blue and cold and eight billion miles from anywhere.

Six weeks later, the *Viento Libre* crossed the finish line a full
month ahead of the nearest competitor. No yacht in the history of the
Grand Prix had ever won by such a margin. The race committee debated
whether riding a solar flare constituted a rules violation and concluded,
after three days of argument, that the rules said nothing about solar
flares because no one had ever been crazy enough to try it.

Ines Guerrero accepted the trophy — a silver sextant mounted on a
pedestal of lunar crystal — in a ceremony on Neptune Station, with her
crew beside her and her hair, as predicted, mostly gone.

"Captain Guerrero," the race marshal asked, "would you do it again?"

She thought about the crest of the wave. The ship singing. The stars
blurring. The feeling of riding the fury of a star and coming out the
other side.

"Every time," she said.

                         THE BONE ORCHARD

                         by Lucian Marsh

================================================================================

                               I.

They found the orchard on the thirty-seventh day.

The colony ship *Perseverance* had set down on Kepler-442b in the late
autumn of the planet's long year, when the native vegetation — if it
could be called vegetation; it was more like a collaboration between
fungus and mineral — was shedding its crystalline spores into air the
color of weak tea. The colonists, two hundred and twelve souls from
Earth, had spent the first month establishing perimeter, raising
shelters, and cataloging the immediate biome with the grim efficiency
of people who understood that their survival depended on knowing exactly
what kind of world they had chosen to inhabit.

It was a good world, mostly. Breathable atmosphere. Tolerable gravity.
Water that required only modest filtration. The native life was carbon-
based, which was encouraging, and appeared to be non-aggressive, which
was more encouraging still. Dr. Petra Engstrom, the colony's chief
biologist, described the ecosystem as "cooperative" — organisms that
shared resources, distributed nutrients through networks of underground
filaments, and seemed to lack the competitive instincts that drove
evolution on Earth.

"Nothing here eats anything else," she told the colony council at their
weekly meeting. "It's all mutualism. Symbiosis on a planetary scale.
Frankly, it makes me nervous."

"Why?" asked Governor Hale, a practical man who preferred problems he
could solve with lumber and concrete.

"Because Earth has competition because competition works. If nothing on
this planet competes, either there's a reason we haven't found yet, or
there's a predator we haven't met."

Nobody laughed. They had all read enough history to know that the
things you hadn't found yet were the things that killed you.

The orchard was discovered by a survey team mapping the terrain south
of the colony. Team leader Marcus Cole, a former park ranger from
Wyoming who had volunteered for the colony because he preferred
landscapes to people, reported it by radio in a voice that his
colleagues noted was unusually careful, as though he were choosing each
word from a selection of items that might explode.

"We've found — structures," he said. "About four kilometers south.
Arranged in rows. They look like — I don't want to say what they
look like. I think you should come see."


                               II.

What they looked like was trees made of bone.

They rose from the dark soil in rows, precisely spaced, each one
approximately two meters tall. Their trunks were smooth and pale, the
color and texture of old ivory, and they branched at regular intervals
into limbs that curved upward and outward in configurations that were
unsettlingly familiar. Here, the sweep of a rib cage. There, the
articulation of a shoulder joint. At the crown of each tree, a structure
that resembled — but was not quite — a skull, eyeless and open-mouthed,
tilted toward the tea-colored sky.

They were not human bones. The proportions were wrong — too elongated,
too symmetrical, with extra joints and a geometry that suggested a body
plan quite different from the human. But they were recognizably skeletal.
These were the remains of living beings, and they had been planted in
the soil like seeds.

There were hundreds of them.

Dr. Engstrom walked the rows with a scanner and a face that had gone
pale under its tan. She took samples. She ran analyses. She knelt in
the dark soil and dug carefully around the base of one of the bone trees,
and what she found there made her sit back on her heels and stare.

"Roots," she said. "The bones have roots."

The lower portions of each skeleton had extended downward into the soil,
sending out filaments of calcified tissue that penetrated the earth in
the same branching patterns as the underground networks she had observed
in the native vegetation. The bone trees were connected — to each other,
and to the broader ecosystem of the planet.

"They're growing," she said. "The bones are growing."

Governor Hale, who had accompanied the team, looked at the rows of
skeletal trees stretching to the horizon and said the only thing a
practical man could say:

"Growing into what?"


                              III.

Into fruit, as it turned out.

The fruit appeared over the following weeks — small, pale spheres that
budded at the tips of the bone-branches and swelled slowly to the size
of apples. They were warm to the touch, pulsing with a faint biolumi-
nescence that was visible at twilight, and they smelled — this was the
detail that no one talked about comfortably — they smelled of memory.

Not a specific memory. Not a scent that could be identified and named.
Rather, each fruit carried an olfactory signature that triggered, in
the person who smelled it, a cascade of recollection so vivid and so
personal that it felt less like remembering and more like reliving. Cole
stood near a bone tree and smelled his grandmother's house in Laramie —
not the abstract concept of his grandmother's house, but the specific
sensory reality of it: wood polish, lavender, the creak of the third
stair, the quality of afternoon light through the kitchen window. He
staggered and had to be caught by a colleague.

Engstrom hypothesized that the fruit contained compounds that interacted
with the human olfactory-limbic pathway, the neurological link between
smell and memory that was the oldest and most powerful sensory connection
in the brain. "The fruit is reading us," she said. "The same way the
native ecosystem reads everything — through the underground filaments,
through chemical signaling, through the cooperative mutualism that
defines this planet's biology. It's sampling our biochemistry and
producing compounds tailored to our neural architecture."

"But the memories it triggers," said Dr. Mikhail Sorokin, the colony's
psychologist. "They're not random. They're — curated. Specific. It's
as if the fruit knows which memories to activate."

"The memories belong to the dead," Engstrom said. She held up a
scanner reading. "The bone trees are the remains of a sentient species.
A species that buried its dead here, in soil that is part of a planet-
wide cooperative organism. The organism preserved them. Grew them. And
encoded their memories in a medium — the fruit — that could transmit
those memories to other minds."

"An alien cemetery," Hale said.

"More than a cemetery. A library. An archive. The dead are not gone.
They're — stored. Their memories encoded in fruit that grows from their
bones, accessible to anyone who tastes it."

No one spoke for a long time.

"No one," Governor Hale said firmly, "is to eat the fruit."


                               IV.

The children ate the fruit.

Of course they did. There were forty-one children in the colony, ranging
in age from three to sixteen, and they had the same relationship with
parental prohibitions that children have always had: they heard them,
they understood them, and they disregarded them at the earliest
opportunity.

The first to eat was Mara Volkov, age nine, a serious girl with dark
eyes and a habit of wandering farther from camp than her parents
preferred. She was found sitting beneath a bone tree at the edge of
the orchard, a half-eaten fruit in her hands, her eyes open but
unfocused, her face wearing an expression that her father, arriving at
a run, could not interpret. It was not pain. It was not pleasure. It was
something else — a concentration so deep it resembled absence, as though
Mara's body were present but her mind had traveled somewhere her father
could not follow.

"Mara." He knelt beside her. "Mara, can you hear me?"

She turned to him. Her eyes focused slowly, like a camera adjusting to
light.

"Papa," she said. "I met someone."

"Who?"

"I don't know her name. But she was — old. And she remembered everything.
She remembered the sky when it was a different color. She remembered
when the trees were alive and had flesh on them, before they became
bones. She remembered her children."

Dr. Sorokin was called. He examined Mara and found her physically
unharmed — pupils responsive, vital signs normal, cognitive function
intact. But she was different. She had a gravity to her that had not
been there before, a quality of attention that made her seem older
than nine, as though the memories she had absorbed had added layers to
her awareness.

She was not the last. Over the following week, despite all efforts at
enforcement, eleven more children found their way to the orchard and
ate the fruit. Each one reported the same experience: not a hallucination,
not a dream, but a genuine encounter with an alien consciousness — the
preserved mind of a dead being, communicated through taste and smell
and the ancient architecture of the brain.

The children began to change.

Not physically — they remained small and human and fragile. But their
behavior shifted. They became quieter, more observant. They stopped
fighting with each other. They developed an uncanny sensitivity to the
emotional states of the adults around them, responding to tensions and
anxieties that had not been expressed aloud. Mara Volkov, the first to
eat, began drawing pictures of the alien species whose bones composed
the orchard — accurate pictures, Engstrom confirmed, that matched the
skeletal anatomy perfectly. Drawings of beings she could not have seen,
rendered from memories she had consumed.

"They're integrating," Sorokin told the colony council. "The alien
memories are not replacing their own. They're — supplementing them. The
children are developing a kind of dual consciousness: their own
experience, plus a reservoir of alien experience that they can access
like a library."

"Is it harming them?"

"I don't think so. But I can't be certain. The neural effects are
unprecedented. These children have more memory than any human being
should possess — lifetimes of experience from a species we know nothing
about. What that does to a developing mind over time — I have no model
for it."

Governor Hale looked at the council. Twelve adults responsible for the
survival and well-being of two hundred and twelve colonists, including
forty-one children, on a planet whose cooperative biology had apparently
decided to include them in its network by feeding their children the
memories of the dead.

"Can we stop them?" he asked.

"We can try," said Sorokin. "But the children are drawn to the orchard.
They describe it as a need — not a craving, not an addiction, but a
pull, like gravity. The fruit is offering them something that the human
mind appears to want: connection. Memory. The experience of a mind
larger than their own."

"And if we fence off the orchard?"

"They'll find another way. The bone trees are part of the planet's
network. The filaments extend for kilometers. Engstrom tells me the
fruit will eventually grow anywhere the network reaches."

Hale sat back. Outside the council chamber, through the window, he
could see the orchard in the distance — rows of pale, skeletal trees
against the tea-colored sky, their fruit glowing faintly in the
gathering dusk. And among them, small figures moving — children, walking
the rows with a patience and a purpose that belonged to beings much
older than themselves.


                               V.

Mara Volkov came to see Governor Hale on a Tuesday evening, when the
colony was settling into its routine and the twin moons were rising over
the hills to the east. She stood in the doorway of his office, a small
girl in a colony-issue jumpsuit, her dark eyes carrying the weight of
something vast.

"I want to explain," she said.

Hale gestured to a chair. She sat in it with a composure that belonged
to someone three times her age.

"The beings who lived here — the ones whose bones are in the orchard —
they called themselves the Keth. They were here for a very long time.
Longer than humans have been on Earth. They built no cities, made no
tools, had no technology. They didn't need it. They had the network."

"The underground filaments."

"The network connects everything on this planet. Every organism, every
being, living and dead. The Keth were part of it. They lived cooperatively
— with each other, with the planet. When they died, the network preserved
them. Their bodies became trees. Their memories became fruit. Death was
not an ending for the Keth. It was a — change of medium."

"What happened to them? Why are there only bones?"

Mara was quiet for a moment. When she spoke, her voice was careful, and
Hale had the unsettling impression that she was choosing words from a
vocabulary that included concepts for which English had no equivalents.

"They completed themselves. All of them, over thousands of years. They
lived, they died, they were preserved. Eventually, every Keth who would
ever live had lived and died, and the orchard was full, and the network
held all of them — every memory, every experience, every moment of
Keth existence, encoded in the fruit and the soil and the filaments.
They became, in a sense, the planet itself. The living world that you
see around you — the cooperative ecosystem, the mutualism, the absence
of competition — that is the Keth. Not their legacy. Them. Still alive,
in the way that matters."

"And the fruit?"

"The fruit is an invitation. The Keth preserved their memories not
for themselves — they already have the network — but for whoever came
next. Whoever found this world and chose to live here. The fruit is
a gift: the entire accumulated wisdom of a civilization, offered freely
to anyone willing to receive it."

"And what does it do to human children?"

Mara looked at him with her dark, weighted eyes, and for a moment Hale
did not see a nine-year-old girl. He saw something older, something
that carried the experience of an entire species in the quiet spaces
behind its gaze.

"It makes us better," she said. "Not different. Not alien. Better.
We are still ourselves. But we have — more. More memory. More
understanding. More connection to the world we live on. The Keth
didn't die so that their orchard could be a museum. They died so that
whoever came after could inherit what they learned."

Hale sat in his chair and looked at this child who was, and was not,
the Mara Volkov he had known a month ago. He thought about his
responsibility — to the colony, to the children, to the future they
were building on this alien world. He thought about the bone orchard,
glowing in the dusk, its fruit hanging heavy and warm on branches that
were the remains of beings who had loved this planet enough to become
part of it.

"The other adults," he said. "They're afraid."

"They should be. This is a frightening thing. But the fruit will not
force itself on anyone. The network does not compete; it cooperates.
No adult will be made to eat. No child will be harmed. We will simply
— grow."

Hale looked out the window. The orchard. The moons. The children
walking between the bone trees in the fading light, their small hands
touching the pale branches, their faces tilted toward the warm,
glowing fruit.

"Grow into what?" he asked — the same question he had asked on the
day they found the orchard, standing in the dark soil with the bone
trees rising around him like the ribs of some vast, sleeping creature.

Mara smiled. It was a child's smile, bright and simple, and it
contained, beneath its surface, the accumulated patience of a species
that had measured its time in millennia.

"Into what comes next," she said.

Outside, the orchard pulsed with its gentle bioluminescence, and the
children walked among the bones of the ancient dead, and the fruit
hung ripe and luminous on branches that had once been arms, and the
planet's vast cooperative network hummed beneath the soil like a
song sung by the earth itself, welcoming its newest members into the
choir.

And in the bone orchard, the dead Keth dreamed in the dark, their
memories flowing through root and filament and fruit, patient as
geology, waiting for the next mouth, the next mind, the next question
asked by a small voice in a world that was older than loneliness and
kinder than fear.

ABOUT THE AUTHORS

================================================================================

COL. JAMES "BUCK" STANTON (USAF, Ret.) flew P-51 Mustangs over Europe
and commanded a fighter wing in Korea before retiring from the Air Force
to write the military science fiction that has made him one of this
magazine's most distinctive voices. His stories draw on twenty years of
combat experience and an intimate understanding of what command actually
costs. "Thunder Over Tranquility" reflects his growing interest in the
political tensions between Earth and its colonies — a cold war, he notes,
that "rhymes uncomfortably with several I have witnessed firsthand." He
lives on a ranch outside Fredericksburg, Texas, with his wife Martha,
and continues to stand ramrod-straight and call everyone "son." This is
his eighth appearance in these pages.

CORDELL BEAUMONT is a New Orleans writer whose lush, sensory-rich prose
has established him as one of science fiction's premier world-builders.
A former merchant marine officer who traveled extensively in the South
Pacific, Beaumont writes about alien worlds with the intoxicated
attention of a man who has spent his life falling in love with landscapes.
"The Pleasure Gardens of Procyon" is, he says, "the most personal story
I have written — a story about the difference between pleasure and joy,
which is the same as the difference between a beautiful cage and an
open road." He lives in New Orleans with his wife Lisette, a painter,
and tends a courtyard garden that he describes as "modest by Procyoni
standards." This is his sixth appearance in these pages.

PHYLLIS CRENSHAW holds a degree in philosophy and logic from the
University of Pennsylvania and brings a puzzle-maker's delight to her
fiction, which is almost exclusively concerned with the paradoxes and
pleasures of time travel. "The Time Traveler's Cookbook" began, she
reports, when she attempted to recreate a Roman recipe and wondered
what it would taste like with soy sauce. "The answer was delicious," she
says, "and the implications were horrifying." She lives in Philadelphia
with her husband David and their two children, and notes that her own
cooking is "strictly contemporary, and strictly terrible." This is her
seventh appearance in these pages.

THEODORE CAIN is the most prolific contributor in the history of this
magazine and a writer whose versatility is matched only by his
reliability. A former autoworker and current technical writer at General
Motors, Cain writes fiction every evening from eight to midnight and
has never missed a deadline. "Salvage Rights" was inspired by a
conversation with a merchant sailor about maritime law and the things
that drift in deep water. "The sea is full of surprises," Cain says,
"and space is fuller." He lives in Dearborn, Michigan, with his wife
Jean, and this is his sixteenth appearance in these pages — a record he
holds with characteristic modesty.

DOUGLAS PEMBERTON is a British humorist and occasional science fiction
writer whose work has appeared in Punch, The New Yorker, and several
publications that he insists are not as disreputable as they sound. A
graduate of Balliol College, Oxford, and a former Royal Navy officer
of spectacular self-described incompetence, Pemberton approaches the
future with the genial bafflement of a man who has never quite figured
out the present. "The Equation That Ate Chicago" was written, he says,
"as a cautionary tale about the dangers of doing mathematics too well,
a danger to which I am personally immune." He lives in Woking, Surrey,
with his wife Penelope, three dogs, two cats, a parrot, and a tortoise
named Doris. This is his eighth appearance in these pages.

ROBERT "BOB" FINLEY learned to write in the pulps, and he has brought
the pulps' finest qualities — speed, color, and the unshakable
conviction that the reader's excitement matters more than anything else
— to every story he has published in these pages. A Chicagoan born and
bred, Finley spent fifteen years writing for Thrilling Wonder Stories,
Planet Stories, and every other market that would pay him before joining
our roster. "Solar Wind" is his love letter to racing and to the sailors
who taught him that the best way to survive a storm is to ride it.
He lives in Rogers Park, Chicago, with his wife Carol and an apartment
full of cats. This is his fifteenth appearance in these pages.

LUCIAN MARSH is the pen name of a reclusive New England writer whose
dark, atmospheric fiction occupies a unique space at the intersection
of science fiction and horror. We can reveal that he was born in
Massachusetts, that he was educated at Brown University, and that he has
spent time as an orderly in a psychiatric hospital — experiences that
inform the clinical precision with which he renders states of dread and
displacement. "The Bone Orchard" is, by his own account, "not a horror
story but a love story, told by the dead to the living." We leave our
readers to judge for themselves. This is his sixth appearance in these
pages.

SIGNALS RECEIVED
Letters to the Editor

================================================================================

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I have now read every issue of your magazine from the first to the
seventeenth, and I wish to register a formal complaint: you are ruining
my marriage. My wife says I have not spoken a complete sentence to her
since January 1953, and she is probably right. I read your magazine at
breakfast, at lunch, on the bus, and under the covers with a flashlight
after she has gone to sleep. I have missed three dinner parties, two
dentist appointments, and my own wedding anniversary. She threatens to
cancel my subscription. I beg you: write to her and explain that this
is not my fault. I am the victim of excellent fiction.

                              — Harold J. Perkins, Cleveland, Ohio

[Mr. Perkins, we sympathize deeply but cannot intervene in domestic
affairs. We suggest flowers, a sincere apology, and a subscription for
Mrs. Perkins. If she reads the magazine herself, she will either
understand your condition or develop it, and either way, the argument
is resolved. — M.S.]

  *

Dear Editor,

Colonel Stanton's "The Siege of Fortress Luna" in your April issue was
the finest military SF story I have read since Heinlein's "Starship
Troopers." I spent twenty years in the Navy, and Stanton is the only
writer in your pages who understands what it actually feels like to give
an order that gets people killed. More Stanton, please. And tell him
the Navy sends its respects.

                              — Commander (Ret.) Walter Gaines, Annapolis, Md.

[Commander Gaines, the Colonel sends his thanks and notes that "the Navy
is welcome, as always, to ride along while the Air Force does the real
work." We decline to take sides in this perennial dispute. — M.S.]

  *

Dear Mr. Sterling,

I am writing to ask whether Mr. Beaumont's alien worlds are real. My
daughter, who is fourteen, has read "The Cloud Kingdoms of Nephele"
seven times and is now insisting that she will become an interplanetary
explorer when she grows up. Her science teacher says this is not a
realistic career goal. I say that no one told Columbus his career goal
was realistic, either. Who is right?

                              — Mrs. Patricia Holm, Seattle, Wash.

[Mrs. Holm, Mr. Beaumont's worlds are, alas, fictional — but your
daughter's ambition is not. The first interplanetary explorers are
alive today, somewhere, reading science fiction and dreaming. Encourage
her. — M.S.]

  *

Dear TALES FROM THE FUTURE,

Phyllis Crenshaw's stories make my head hurt. I mean this as a
compliment. "Comet's Tale" in your December issue left me staring at
the ceiling for an hour trying to figure out whether the ending was
happy or sad. I eventually concluded it was both, which I think was the
point. More Crenshaw, please, and more aspirin.

                              — Eleanor Ng, San Francisco, Calif.

[Miss Ng, we are pleased to report that Mrs. Crenshaw returns this month
with "The Time Traveler's Cookbook," which may require a full bottle of
aspirin and is worth every tablet. — M.S.]

  *

Dear Sir,

I notice that your magazine has published exactly zero stories set in
Australia. The future, I assure you, includes Australia. We have
deserts, unusual wildlife, and a healthy disregard for authority, all
of which would translate beautifully to science fiction. I volunteer to
write the first Australian SF story for your pages if none of your
current stable is up to the task.

                              — Colin Whitaker, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia

[Mr. Whitaker, you are correct, and we are ashamed. We hereby
invite submissions set in, on, or near Australia, and we look forward
to yours. Manuscripts should be typed, double-spaced, and accompanied
by a stamped, self-addressed envelope — or, in your case, by whatever
the Australian postal service considers equivalent. — M.S.]

THE BOOKSHELF OF TOMORROW
Book Reviews

================================================================================

THE CAVES OF STEEL by Isaac Asimov
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Dr. Asimov has accomplished something I would have thought impossible:
he has written a detective novel set in the future that is equally
satisfying as science fiction and as mystery. In a world where Earth's
population lives in vast enclosed cities and relations with the Spacer
worlds are tense, plainclothes detective Elijah Baley is partnered with
R. Daneel Olivaw — a humanoid robot — to solve a murder that could
ignite an interplanetary incident. The world-building is meticulous, the
mystery is fair-play and genuinely surprising, and the relationship
between Baley and Daneel is drawn with a warmth and complexity that
elevates the entire enterprise. Dr. Asimov demonstrates, as he has
before, that ideas and entertainment are not enemies but allies. Highly
recommended.

MISSION OF GRAVITY by Hal Clement
(Doubleday, 1954, $2.75)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Clement's novel is a masterclass in hard science fiction — a
story set on the high-gravity world of Mesklin, where a sea captain
(whose species resembles a large centipede) assists human scientists in
retrieving a stranded research probe. The planet is the true
protagonist: an oblate spheroid whose gravity ranges from three times
Earth's at the equator to seven hundred times at the poles, described
with a rigor that will delight physicists and a narrative drive that
will satisfy everyone else. Clement writes with the lucidity of a born
teacher, making complex physics accessible without ever condescending.
If you have ever wanted to feel the weight of a world, this is your
book.

BRAIN WAVE by Poul Anderson
(Ballantine Books, 1954, $2.00)

Reviewed by Maxwell Sterling

Mr. Anderson poses a magnificent question: what would happen if, one
day, every living brain on Earth suddenly became more intelligent?
His answer is a novel that is by turns exhilarating, unsettling, and
deeply humane. When the solar system moves out of a region of space
that has been suppressing neural activity for millions of years,
intelligence explodes — in humans, in animals, in everything with a
nervous system. The consequences are explored with Anderson's
characteristic blend of scientific rigor and emotional depth, and the
novel's conclusion is both inevitable and surprising. A fine addition
to a remarkable year for science fiction novels.

COMING ATTRACTIONS
Next Month in Tales from the Future and Beyond

================================================================================

Issue #19 — July 1954

The heat of summer brings no respite from the extraordinary. Next month,
we are proud to present:

"THE COYOTE RUN" by Robert "Bob" Finley — Smuggler "Coyote" Vasquez
runs contraband between Earth and the outer colonies, staying one jump
ahead of the Space Patrol. When her cargo turns out to be something
alive — and something valuable enough to start a war — the chase of
her life begins. Finley at full throttle.

"YESTERDAY'S TOMORROW" by Phyllis Crenshaw — A 1950s housewife discovers
a time capsule buried in her backyard that will not be sealed for another
hundred years. Inside: a letter from her own great-granddaughter, asking
for help with a problem that hasn't happened yet. Crenshaw's most
heartfelt story to date.

"THE EXAMINER" by Lucian Marsh — Students at a prestigious academy must
pass a final examination administered by a machine that tests not
knowledge but character, and that kills those who fail. Not for the
faint of heart.

"NINE THOUSAND PAGES OF MANNERS" by Douglas Pemberton —
When humanity makes first contact with a species obsessed with manners,
the fate of diplomatic relations rests on the shoulders of the most
socially awkward man alive. Pemberton's funniest story yet.

"DEAD RUN TO PLUTO" by Robert "Bob" Finley — Mail courier Jake Trent
races against a deadline to deliver a pardon to a man scheduled for
execution on Pluto. His ship is fast, but the clock is faster. A pulse-
pounding race against time and distance.

Plus stories by Theodore Cain and Agnes Whitfield, letters from our
readers, book reviews, and more.
